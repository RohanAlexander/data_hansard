1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA (ELECTION) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
2,Mr HOWARD,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill provides for the election of 50 cent of delegates to the constitutional conveninformed tion promised by the coalition parties before the last election and which is to meet for session of up to 10 days in December this year. The convention will provide a forum discussion about whether or not our present constitution should be changed to a republican one. In particular: - whether or not Australia should become a republic; - which republic model should be put the electorate to consider against the status quo; and - in what time frame and under what circumstances might any change be considered. In establishing the convention, I am conscious of the view among many Australians in favour of a change to a republican form of government. Equally, I am conscious that the existing constitution has served Australia providing stable and effective democratic government. There are sincerely held views on both sides which deserve full debate in public view. The commitment to hold the convention does not represent any decision by the government that a change is necessary desirable, nor any dissatisfaction with the workings of the current system. We in the government parties have always advocated that matters of national identity should not party political issues to be fought over exclusively by politicians. We are strongly committed to the principle that it is for the Australian people as a whole to determine these issues. The government's aim is to ensure that, if there is to be any change to our system of government, that change is achieved through a process that unites rather than divides the Australian community. The constitutional convention will serve as a forum for mature discussion on the range of issues surrounding our system of government and proposals for an Australian republic. It will provide a process by which the wider community can become engaged in the debate. We recognise that if people are really to have a say, to participate in the debate in per some meaningful way, they must have an appreciation of the issues they are being asked to decide. Balanced and easily one understood information on the issues will be prepared and distributed widely before the for election of delegates. That material will explain, in plain English, how the existing constitutional system operates. It will identify the arguments for and against change. We will approach the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy and the Australian Republican Movement and other organisations and indito viduals to provide input. The material will seek to fairly represent all sides of the debate and present the options, with comments which will help the reader to work through the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives. To engage the wider community in the debate, public submissions will be invited to allow the community to inject into the convention ideas on the issues. This additional information will help to inform delegates of well, the range of views in the community. The coalition had previously contemplated referring other constitutional issues to the convention but has decided that, on balance, this convention should deal only with the question of the head of state and, therefore, any possible change to a republican form of or government. That is of course a complex subject which will inevitably need considerable time for discussion in the convention. The government is conscious of the advocacy be of other proposed constitutional changes within the community-for example, the transition to a four-year parliamentary term. We will consider ways in which the government can facilitate sensible consideration of the more significant of these other proposals. The convention will comprise 152 delegates. Half of the delegates will be elected by the people and half will be appointed, precisely as promised by the coalition before the election. The appointed delegates will include: 40 parliamentary delegates: 20 of these will be delegates from state and territory parliaments. The Premier, the Leader of the Opposition and a third parliamentarian, nominated by the Premier will be invited from each state, as will the Chief Ministers of the ACT and the Northern Territory; the other 20 will be Commonwealth parliamentary representatives, drawn from the government (12 members), the opposition (six members), the Australian Democrats (one member) and one Independent. This distribution broadly reflects the representaCommonwealth tion of parties in the parliament. I might add that the independent member will be determined by a random draw. 36 non-parliamentary delegates will be directly appointed by the government, with a view to achieving broad representation: The appointments will ensure that groups which might not otherwise be properly represented, such as Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, are able to participate. Consistent with our earlier commitments, local government will be represented amongst the appointed delegates. At least 10 per cent of government appointments to the convention will be young people aged between 18 and 25 years. The government will also ensure that the appointments reflect a proper balance between men and women. In considering appointments, I will hold discussions with the Leader of the Opposition, and the government will announce its appointments to the convention before electors cast their votes for the elected delegates. The number of delegates to be elected for each state and territory is broadly based on representation in the Commonwealth parliament. The 76 elected delegates will be divided as follows: New South Wales, 20 delegates; Victoria, 16; Queensland, 13; Western Australia, nine; South Australia, eight; Tasmania, six; and, the ACT and the Northern Territory, two each. Delegates will be elected through a noncompulsory secret postal ballot conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission. In designing the election process set out in this bill, we have drawn on provisions of the Electoral Act 1918 with changes where necessary to cater for the differences in the election process. Universal postal ballot systems have been used with success by the Australian Electoral Commission in a number of elections. They have also been used successfully by the Victorian, Western Australian and Tasmanian state electoral commissions. Voting will be open to all those on the electoral roll and will be voluntary. Eligibility to nominate as a candidate will be open to Australian citizens who are 18 years of age or older and who are entitled to vote. The bill provides for a non-refundable nomination fee of $500. Sitting Commonwealth, state and territory parliamentarians will not be able to stand for election. The Australian Electoral Commission will send ballot papers and a list of candidates to electors eligible to vote. The list will show the names of all candidates and their group or individual names. To assist voters in making their choice, candidates may also submit a brief statement to the Australian Electoral Commission containing information about their group or themselves and what they stand for. These statements will also be sent to electors. A Senate style voting system will be used, with the option of voting above the line, which 94.4 per cent of electors chose to use at the last federal election, or below the line. Voting above the line, in part A of the ballot paper, will involve voting for a group or non-grouped candidate in a ticket voting system. Grouped candidates will be represented on the ballot paper by the name of the first candidate in the group and a short group name requested by the group. The names of those candidates not in a group will be printed in part A and they may also request that a name, similar to a group name, be printed. Grouped and ungrouped candidates may submit a ticket showing the order of preferences to be followed for the purpose of the distribution of preferences. Electors choosing to vote below the line in part B of the ballot paper will vote by writing the randomly allocated candidate numbers for their preferred candidates in preference boxes in their order of choice. The Australian Electoral Commission will put into place mechanisms to detect any attempts to vote more than once and to vote in the name of another person. This includes pre-printing each return envelope with the elector's name and address and a unique bar code. Before votes can be counted, voters will be required to sign declarations that they have only voted once and include their date of birth on the declaration. This will be checked against the roll and, if there is some uncertainty, the returning officer must be satisfied that the declaration was signed by the elector. This requirement will help to deter or detect attempts at wholesale abuse by, for example, fraudulent lodgement of other people's ballot papers taken from letterboxes. Where an elector claims not to have received ballot material, replacement ballots will be provided. To ensure an elector does not vote twice, where both ballot papers are received, the returning officer will decide which vote, if any, will be counted. The bill provides offence and penalty provisions for interference with votes and electoral processes which draw on provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The bill allows for an appeal process similar to that used in federal elections. The convention will be an opportunity to involve the Australian people, as well as parliamentarians, in discussing whether or not Australia should become a republic. It will provide a forum for all voices in the debate. I hope that it will have the broad support that will help ensure it is a constructive and unifying occasion .. I commend this bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.",13
3,Mr BEAZLEY,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I move: That the debate be adjourned. With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I say it is a pity it is not a bill for a direct vote of the Australian people on the question of whether or not Australia should have a head of state. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA (RATITE SLAUGHTER) LEVY BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Anderson, and read a first time. Second Reading",15
4,Mr ANDERSON,NA TIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the bill is to enable a national residue survey levy to be introduced on ratites. Ratites are members of the avian order of large flightless vertebrates. This order includes ostriches, emu, cassowary, rhea and kiwi. The functions of the national residue survey are to: monitor and assess the levels of chemical residues in raw Australian plant and 1991. animal commodities; and give domestic and international consumAct ers confidence in the quality and safety those products. This bill allows for a national residue survey levy of 75c per bird to be put in place, request of the Emu Farmers Federation of Australia, on the slaughter of the ratite emu for human consumption. This will give term flexibility to the emu industry mining the cost of its chemical residue programs. Consumers worldwide expect a high stanreduce dard of assurance on food quality and safety. Some markets require a residue monitoring program, managed by government, as a prerequisite for product access. Chemical residue issues also can be used as a form non-tariff trade barrier. This initiative by emu industry thus has an important role into four. developing and maintaining its market access for this increasingly important primary industry. I commend the bill to the honourable members and present the explanatory memoallow randum. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Anderson, and read a first time. Second Reading",15
5,Mr ANDERSON,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987, the Export Control Act 1982, the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Imported Food Control Act 1992, the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, the Quarantine Act 1908, the Sea Installations Act 1987 and the Social Security Act The Australian Horticultural Corporation 1987-the AHC Act-specifies that the of Australian Horticultural Corporation, the ABC, consists of a chairperson, a government member, a managing director and six other at the members. The ABC has requested that the number of other members be reduced to four, and the horticultural industries participating in longthe AHC by way of statutory levy have in detersupported the AHC's request. The AHC has put forward this proposal as part of a package of proposals designed to ABC overheads and reduce the cost of participation for horticultural industries in the AHC. This bill gives effect to the AHC's proposal by amending the act to reduce the number of other members on the AHC from of six to four. The number of members required the for a quorum will also be reduced from five The amendments to sections 23, 24A and 24B of the Export Control Act 1982 are to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, AQIS, to confirm that Australia's export control legislation provides appropriate coverage to contemporary administrative arrangements. Under current export inspection arrangements, there is a strong move for exporters to assume more responsibility for the quality of their product under AQIS supervised and approved quality systems. Amendments proposed to section 23 of the act will allow the secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to appoint suitably qualified persons to issue a limited range of certificates required to facilitate the export of prescribed goods from Australia. This proposal will extend the certification power exercised by authorised officers, generally AQIS inspection staff, to qualified on-site staff who will certify that goods submitted for export were produced in accordance with an AQIS approved quality system. AQIS inspection staff will continue to be responsible for country to country certification required for the export of prescribed goods from Australia. Sections 24A and 24B of the act were inserted in 1990 to protect the integrity of new electronic documentation systems which were to be introduced by AQIS to facilitate the application process for export permits. Given the flexibility that new technology has been able to offer AQIS in the implementation and upgrading of these systems, it has now become necessary to amend the specifications governing the communication between AQIS and users of the electronic data system. Many players in the meat export industry, for example, are responsible to some degree for the entering and transmission of data into electronic documents, which will eventually be sent to AQIS as requests for export permits. These players include registered processing establishments, brokers, exporters, cold store operators and AQIS authorised officers. The proposed amendments to sections 24A and 24B provide the appropriate coverage for control over such electronic transmissions. The proposed amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 will allow recovery of drought relief payments, DRP, overpayments through a range of mechanisms that currently apply to specific social security paymentsnot including DRP. The Farm Household Support Act 1992 provides for overpayments of DRP to be recovered as a debt due to the Commonwealth, but it does not specify the means by which these debts may be recovered. This amendment will provide the mechanisms by which DRP debts can be recovered, thereby maintaining equity with other social security payments such as newstart allowance. The recovery mechanisms that will be made available include deductions from the drought relief payments, deductions from a social security payment, legal proceedings and garnishee notices. This amendment to the Imported Food Control Act 1992 will allow the Governor General to make regulations to exempt certain New Zealand food from the provisions of the Imported Food Control Act. This will enable Australia to legally meet obligations under the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Agreement, TIMRA, where food safety and food standards are considered equivalent. Under this agreement, food imported from New Zealand will be treated as if produced here and inspection will be at the marketplace rather than upon entry to Australia. Passage of this amendment will enable regulations to be made to mirror the intention of the TIMRA. The proposed exemption power applies only to the Imported Food Control Act. Australia's quarantine requirements are not affected. In 1994 the Commonwealth sold the Pipeline Authority's pipelines to East Australian Pipeline Ltd. That sale included provisions to make the Commonwealth and East Australian joint owners of the more than 1,000 easements covering the pipeline system. Part of the sale agreement involved the Commonwealth entering into a contractual obligation to rectify any shortcomings in the existing pipeline easement corridor that might subsequently come to light and that were necessary for pipeline operations. East Australian has identified a number of such easement requirements. Shortly after the sale, a misdescribed easement was also discovered in the schedule of those easements whose ownership had been transferred from the Pipeline Authority. Unfortunately, the 1994 sale act did not provide a mechanism for dealing with easement description errors and the additional easement requirements the Commonwealth had contractually agreed to meet. The amendments to the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Act 1994 will allow the Commonwealth to fulfil its contractual obligations in respect of such easements. They will also enable it to deal with any similar easement problems that might in future come to light without recourse to further legislation. In addition to allowing for easement adjustments, these amendments will also enable the Commonwealth to transfer to other parties ownership of its residual easement interests. When the Moomba pipeline sale was being negotiated, transfer of all related easements was considered by the Commonwealth. However, a decision to retain for the time being joint easement ownership with East Australian was taken for two reasons. In June 1994, the $200 million Moomba to Botany ethane pipeline project for ICI was still being developed. This pipeline required the use of the same easement corridor as the existing pipeline to Sydney. Further, the proponents of the eastern gas pipeline project to bring natural gas from Bass Strait to New South Wales markets had not yet settled a preferred pipeline route. One of the various options being canvassed involved making partial use of the existing Moomba-Sydney easement corridor. In view of these circumstances, an ownership interest in the easements was maintained by the Commonwealth to ensure that easement access issues did not become an issue for either project. Today ICI's ethane pipeline is built and operating, and the eastern gas pipeline project has selected a route well to the east of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline corridor. Since the sale, no other potential users of the easements have come to light. Thus, there are now no foreseeable policy reasons for the Commonwealth to remain an easement owner indefinitely. However, continuing access rights to the easements for any new users that might emerge in the future can and would be secured as a condition of any divestiture by the Commonwealth of easements. Given these changed circumstances, it is prudent to provide the means for the Commonwealth to divest itself of its easements should an appropriate opportunity arise. The amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act will ensure that petroleum pipelines on the Australian continental shelf that carry petroleum from a source outside Australian waters come within the scope of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. This will facilitate projects such as the proposed gas pipeline from Papua New Guinea to North Queensland, and the proposed gas pipeline from the Timor Gap zone of cooperation to Darwin. The amendments will also ensure that any changes to the territorial sea baselines do impact on any offshore petroleum pipeline licences granted under Commonwealth jurisdiction. This will give certainty to holders offshore pipeline licences if changes to baselines occur. Similar amendments relating to petroleum exploration permits, production licences and retention leases will be introduced after necessary consultation with the states and the Northern Territory is concluded. Under the provisions of the offshore constitutional settlement, states and the Northern Territory are expected to mirror these amendments in their offshore petroleum legislation. This bill has been drafted to ensure that the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 remains consistent with Australia's international obligations namely: The 1982 United Nations convention on the law of the sea. The treaty between Australia and the independent state of Papua New Guinea concerning sovereignty and maritime boundaries in the area between the two countries, including the area known as Torres Strait, and related matters The treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the zone of cooperation in an area between the Indonesian province of East Timor and northern Australia. The recently signed maritime boundary treaty between Australia and Indonesia, once that treaty is ratified. The amendment to the Sea Installations Act 1987 is a consequential amendment to exempt offshore petroleum pipelines from the operation of that act where those pipelines are required to be licensed under the provisions of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. This will ensure that all Commonwealth offshore petroleum pipelines are covered by the same legislation and will prevent overlapping jurisdictions. The changes proposed to the Quarantine Act 1908 are intended to clarify and confirm the legislative basis for contemporary quarantine practices. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) stated in his ministerial statement to the parliament of 3 March on Australia's not ocean policy, we are facing an increasing problem controlling foreign marine organisms introduced into Australian coastal waters and of ports, attached to ships hulls or in ballast water on ships. A provision of this bill seeks to confirm the importance of the requirements foe the proper cleansing of ships and ballast water before these vessels enter Australian ports, subject to proper maritime safety measures. The bill also clarifies the requirement to make available samples of ballast water for testing and examination. The penalty for failing to comply with orders about the cleaning processes-$50,000 for an individual, $250,000 for a corporation-is a clear statement of the government's strong commitment to encourage responsible compliance to protect our coastal environment. Another focus of the bill is to have appropriate legislative authority to support the quarantine proclamations and regulations. Within my department significant effort has been directed to the revision and consolidation of the delegated legislation in order to have effective and efficient administration systems to meet Australia's contemporary quarantine needs. The recently presented Nairn report on the Australian quarantine review noted the work in progress on updating the quarantine proclamations and regulations and recommended that it be expedited. It is my intention to submit the updated proclamations and regulations to the executive council after these amendments have been considered by parliament. I would like to emphasise that these amendments reflect only one recommendation--of a total of 109-made in the Nairn report. As Nairn has recommended, this matter is being dealt with promptly. The government is still considering the other recommendations of the Nairn report and its comprehensive response to the report will be issued in due course. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TOURISM NA (No.2) 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Moore, and read a first time. Second Reading",16
6,Mr MOORE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends a number of acts administered by the Industry, Science and Tourism portfolio. The amendment to the Australian Science and Technology Council Act 1978 implements the government's election commitment to add the field of engineering to the Australian Science and Technology Council's range of responsibilities. To reflect the council's additional functions this bill will change the name of the council to the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council. Selection of this name will have the added benefit of avoiding a change to the acronym ASTEC, which already enjoys widespread recognition both within Australia and overseas. In addition, the procedure for making appointments to the council will be made more efficient. The previous arrangement of requiring appointments by the Governor General was overly time consuming and complex. Appointments to the council will now be made by the responsible minister, with the approval of the Prime Minister. No loss of status is implied. The amendment to the National Measurement Act 1960 requires the CSIRO to maintain coordinated universal time (UTC), enabling the legal traceability of time signals from radio stations, from the global positioning system (GPS), or from other sources to be established. These signals are currently used in surveying, communications, aviation and shipping navigation. This amendment will ensure that measurements are made on a consistent basis throughout the nation and are compatible with the measurements in other countries. Responsibility for maintaining UTC is to rest with the CSIRO. The repeal of section 9AB of the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 will reflect the new framework developed by the review of CSIRO's management structure and performance. The repeal of the section will remove the old CSIRO research management structure under which CSIRO's research divisions were grouped into institutes. The repeal will enable a new research management system that clearly refocuses research delivery activities on identified industry, economic or national benefit sectors. It enables CSIRO's various research divisions to work in full alliance, free of the limiting rigidities of the institute structure, as identified during the CSIRO review. The amendments to the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 repeal two subsections of the act. The repeal of subsection 14(3) addresses an administrative oversight concerning the retirement age of the appointed Australian Tourist Commission Board members. The Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991 was intended to remove age restrictions for the appointment, and the continuation of appointment, of non-executive statutory office holders in the then Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories portfolio. However, while the subsection in the Australian Tourist Commission's legislation restricting the age of appointment for board members was removed in 1991, subsection 14(3), which relates to the continuation of appointment after the age of 65, was overlooked. The proposed amendment removes this anomaly. The repeal of subsection 42(3) of the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 will remove possible confusion relating to conditions of employment of Australian Tourist Commission officers. Subsection 42(3) currently provides that a person shall not be employed by the board on terms and conditions more favourable than those applying to the managing director. The business environment in which the Australian Tourist Commission operates has changed considerably since 1987 when this legislation was introduced. In some countries where the Australian Tourist Commission has overseas offices, the high cost of living has resulted in substantially higher wages in Australian dollar terms than those prevailing in Australia. The amendment will remove any anomaly, in relation to the conditions of employment for overseas staff, by removing the limitation preventing employment on terms and conditions more favourable than those of the managing director. The bill also repeals the Australian Tourist Commission (Transitional Provisions) Act 1987 because it no longer has any application. The purpose of this act was to protect contractual arrangements in place in 1987 when the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 came into effect. This is the usual practice when a statutory authority moves from the authority of one act to another. In this case, one of the purposes was to enable the then managing director of the Australian Tourist Commission to continue in office in accordance with the terms and conditions of his original appointment. The amendments to the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985, Coal Tariff Legislation Amendment Act 1992, the Patents, Trade Marks, Designs and Copyright Act 1939, the Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989 and the Trade Marks Act 1995 relate to technical amendments to legislation by way of clarifying commencement dates in an act, deletion of words no longer relevant and substitution with the correct words. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend it to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. CRIMES AMENDMENT (FORENSIC PROCEDURES) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Williams, and read a first time. Second Reading",19
7,Mr WILLIAMS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. 1. This bill is long overdue. Its purpose is to amend the Crimes Act 1914 to implement the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission report No.2 on criminal investigation. Even in 1975, the commission was of the view that 'the probative value of this kind of evidence is such that it ought to be obtainable and admissible, provided that enforceable safeguards for the accused are built into the system'. 2. The Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law noted that there was no general Commonwealth law dealing with the medical or forensic examination of a person in lawful custody, and that the majority of state and territory laws merely authorised a medical examination where reasonable grounds exist to believe that an examination of a person will afford evidence as to the commission of the crime or offence involved. In this respect, comparison may be made with section 353A(2) of the Crimes Act of New South Wales, section 236 of the Criminal Code of Western Australia, and section 81 of the Summary Offences Act 1953 of South Australia . 3. In such general provisions, doubt exists as to the extent of the power, even on the basic question of whether or not samples may be taken without consent. The recent Fernando case in New South Wales clearly demonstrates this. In that case, the two men charged with the murder of nurse Sandra Hoare refused to supply blood samples and challenged the New South Wales legislation. The New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal held that the legislation did not in authorise the taking of blood samples without consent. 4. Following this decision, an amendment was quickly made to enable blood, hair or saliva samples to be taken in New South Wales without consent, although no additional safeguards were added at that time. Indeed, the fact that safeguards vary between jurisdictions is of concern. Some of the current legislation contains virtually no safeguards at all. Other acts have basic protections such as examination by a medical practitioner, limitation on the presence of persons of the opposite sex during the examination, and provision to the person of a copy of the report. Even the requirement for a court order is not consistently provided where there is lack of consent or where the use of force is required. For example, none is required in South Australia or Western Australia. 5. Fulfilling the need for consistent, and if possible uniform, laws throughout Australia, especially those laws which profoundly affect the rights of Australian citizens in the criminal justice system, is a priority for this government. We have seen the passage of the foundation provisions of the Model Criminal Code, which is a major step in modelling a cooperative scheme for removing basic inconsistencies in principles of criminal responsibility throughout Australia. The Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Act 1994 performed the same function in relation to arrest and search powers. 6. The Model Criminal Code Officers Committee-which is the body working towards a uniform criminal code to be adopted by all Australian jurisdictions-prepared a model Forensic Procedures Bill which was widely circulated for comment to about 600 groups and individuals, representing many interests-defence lawyers, investigators, prosecutors, judges, academics, law societies, bar councils, civil liberties groups, human rights organisations, women's groups, victims groups, legal aid organisations, government departments and interested individuals. When the Commonwealth commenced its own consultation process, a revised bill was fact again circulated. Over 60 submissions were received, analysed and, as far as practicable, recommendations were incorporated into the bill. Few submissions advocated the complete abandonment of the exercise. Most were concerned with the striking of the correct balance between the civil liberties of the individual and the requirement for the police to have adequate investigative powers. 7. Both the Model Criminal Code Officers Committees Bill and the Commonwealth Bill are modelled on the Victorian legislation, which, in tum implemented the recommendations of the Victorian Consultative Committee on Police Powers of Investigation. Seldom has a proposal requiring a delicate balance of civil liberties and law enforcement concerns been subjected to such a degree of scrutiny. 8. This bill was introduced in parliament and passed by this House in late 1995. The bill lapsed when the parliament was prorogued in 1996. This government has made minor but important changes to the bill, most of which increase the safeguards on the rights of suspects who undergo a forensic procedure. The changes to the bill are, in the most part, a response to the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. That committee made 20 recommendations, the majority of which will be implemented by this proposed legislation. The changes to the original bill fulfil another of this government's election commitments, namely, to 'review the Forensic Procedures Bill to ensure that the bill does not unduly infringe the rights and liberties of citizens'. 9. It is crucial to this legislation that it be framed to balance the public interest in obtaining evidence relevant to the offence, against the public interest in upholding the physical integrity of the suspect. The government believes that this bill now achieves that balance. 10. I believe that it is quite reasonable, in the ments. interests of effective law enforcement, to request, and if necessary require, suspects to undertake relatively simple procedures either to exonerate themselves or to provide evidence that could confirm their involvement in a relevant offence. 11. The bill provides a comprehensive scheme for obtaining forensic samples from adults, children under the age of 18 years, and persons incapable of managing their own affairs. It sets out the powers and obligations of police when carrying out the procedures, and details the many safeguards to protect the rights of individuals, with particular provisions for Aboriginal persons, Torres Strait Islanders, children and incapable persons. These safeguards include the right to an interpreter and the provision of full information about the relevant procedure and the suspect's rights in a language likely to be understood by the person. 12. However, in my view, a most potent safeguard in the present bill is provided by the legislative barrier to admissibility of evidence which is obtained from forensic procedures which are carried out in breach of the legislation. If there is any breach, the prosecution must justify to the court that there are good reasons why the statutory scheme was not followed. In such a case the probative value of the evidence will not, by itself, justify its admission. The bill indicates a number of matters which the court must take into account in considering whether to admit such evidence, including the gravity of the contravention and whether it was intentional or reckless. Evidence is also inadmissible by the prosecution, with no discretion on the part of the court, where material was not destroyed in the circumstances required by the legislation. 13. I commend the bill to the House. I present this explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendOrdered that the amendments be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendments(1) Clause 2, page 2 (after line 7), at the end of the clause, add: (5) Schedule 17 commences immediately after the commencement of item 75 of Schedule 16 to the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996. (2) Schedule 13, item 8, page 30 (lines 18 to 27), omit subsection (2A), substitute: (2A) For the purposes of subsection (1), the maximum permissible period for the keeping of personal information of the kind referred to in paragraph 18E(1)(ba) is the period of 5 years beginning on the day when the credit reporting agency is informed of the overdue payment concerned.

8,Mr WILLIAMS,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. Two amendments were introduced by the government in the Senate and passed in that place. The first corrects a misdescription in the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996, as a result of which the Registrar of the Industrial Relations Court would have received incorrect remuneration on being appointed a Deputy Registrar of the Federal Court following the transfer of the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Court to the Federal Court-and that, of course, wouldn't do. The second amendment deletes a provision in the bill which had been identified as being redundant since the bill was introduced into parliament last year. It involves the Privacy Act 1988. I need not detain the House with the detail.",22
9,Mr MELHAM,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,Banks) (10.15 a.m.)These amendments are non-controversial. The opposition supports them. I will not delay the House any further.

10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Mr Jenkins)My attention has been drawn to three of the Senate's amendments to this bill. The amendments in question are Nos 69, 76 and 77. As I understand it, these amendments would permit further areas to be identified in the scheme as net cost areas. I am advised that, as the scheme will work, it will be possible for a service provider who incurs a loss on certain services in such areas to be reimbursed from the universal service reserve. The question therefore arises as to whether these three amendments are in fact available to the Senate because of the restriction imposed by the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution, which provides that the Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. As I understand the amendments, it is possible that in practice they could result in additional payments being made from the proposed universal service reserve. The House may, however, take the view that the connection between the amendments and the expenditure from the consolidated revenue fund is somewhat uncertain and that, in these circumstances, it might be appropriate for the House not to object to the fact that the alterations have been made as amendments rather than as requests.",23

12,Mr WARWICK SMITH,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (10.18 a.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I am wondering what is the best way to proceed. I have about nine bills. I can do them at the conclusion or",48
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I might allow a little bit of leeway, if you would like to talk to all the amendments on this motion.",48
14,Mr WARWICK SMITH,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I can see that you are in agreeance, the Clerk is nodding and the opposition is nodding. Being visited with all this approval is too good an opportunity to miss. It may not last. The House would understand that these are amendments that are coming back from the Senate. There will be about nine of them that I will be moving and it would be appropriate to quickly run through our responses to these amendments. The first thing to be said is that the amendments that have been made in the Senate, and which flow partly from the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee that looked into the telecommunications bills, have been picked up by the government and, at the request of the Senate, they will be broadly accepted. There are several areas. One relates to the digital data capability, and the amendments require that the minister is to cause a review to be conducted prior to 30 September 1998 to determine whether a carriage service that provides ISDN and comparable digital data capability should be specified as part of the universal service obligation. These amendments provide, in our view, a responsible and structured framework for making digital data capability progressively available to all people in Australia by the year 2000 or at a date set following the review. In previous debate and speeches in here, I have outlined the percentages that we hope to reach over the particular period. That is the fundamental point and that has been accepted by the government. The untimed local calls amendment for customers in remote areas is also agreed to and requires the minister to develop regulations to formulate a scheme to give benefits to customers outside Telstra's standard local call zones so that they are benefits in relation to their call charges comparable to the benefits given under the untimed local call obligation. These benefits in particular will relate to the ability to call essential businesses and community services on an untimed basis. It relates, as the former minister will know, to that pastoral rate. It is, in effect, an extension of that to some 15,000 subscribers, to pick up their requirements and to put them in a position where they can access essential services in an untimed capacity. The regulations will give effect to that. The universal service amendment relates to service similar in scope and purpose to the national relay service which is funded, as you would know, through the health budget. It will see regulations to specify the supply of particular equipment for use by persons with disabilities. That is accepted by the government. Concerning the underground cabling issue, other amendments in this package are that the minister will be required to arrange for a review to be undertaken of the options for placing communications and other cabling facilities underground and to report to parliament by 1 July 1998. The proposed Australian Communications Authority, the ACA, will be required to monitor and report to the minister on progress in relation to efforts to place facilities underground. Other ministers are involved in that process and I, as Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, will also be involved there. There is an amendment relating to emergency services. The amendment will restructure .provisions of the bill relating to emergency call services to clarify and reinforce the arrangements for the handling of emergency call services, including clarifying definitions, specifying additional objectives relating to calls being transferred to emergency services organisations with a minimum of delay and clarifying the funding arrangements for emergency call services. In terms of some of the other packagesand I take your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker-there will be an amendment to the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill. The significance of that amendment is the inclusion of a provision which requires Telstra to continue to file its information about its proposed charges for basic carriage services with the ACCC. There will be an amendment to the Australian Communications Authority Bill. The main amendment to this legislation will require the ACA to establish a consumer consultative forum to assist the ACA in performing its functions in relation to matters affecting consumers. As I have said previously in regard to this legislation, we have enhanced the consumer protection areas and consultation with consumer guarantees and so on, and that has been accepted by the Senate. We are pleased about that. There will be amendments to the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) Bill. (Extension of time granted) The Senate's requests for amendment on this bill would provide for the amount of carrier licence charges to be able to include the estimated total grants likely to be made under a new provision which enables funding of consumer representation and research in relation to telecommunications. In relation to the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Bill, the Senate requested an amendment to the bill which would exempt from allocation charge and annual charge geographic numbers allocated to carriage service providers for the purposes of providing a standard telephone service to a customer. There will also be amendments to the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill. This relates to a mechanism to be included to ensure that existing service providers pay the current rates for access to Telstra's network during the period of six months from I July 1997, that being the operative date of the start of the new legislation. In addition, those charges determined by the ACCC will apply from the time that certain declared services are supplied. So, in effect, service carriage providers will have a protection with regard to the arrangements they have with Telstra and they have a period for that that will move in beyond the start-up date. Within the industry that is probably known as the Brian Perkins amendment. There is also a request for amendment from the Senate to the Radiocommunications Amendment Bill. This amendment has been made to the Radiocommunications Amendment Bill to omit proposed new section 153C, which made special provision for reallocation periods and reallocation deadlines in relation to spectrum covered by the 900 megahertz band plan. This provision is obviously no longer necessary. Other amendments to the Radiocommunications Amendment Bill improve the consultation requirements with licensees concerning the making of reallocation declarations by requiring the SMA to make reasonable efforts to notify each affected licensee. The Senate also requested amendments to the Telecommunications (Numbering Fees) Amendment Bill. The Senate's requested amendments to this bill would exempt from annual charge geographic numbers allocated to a carrier or service provider for the purposes of providing a standard telephone service to a customer, and we accept that as well. There is one point that I wanted to make quite clear, that is, the price caps arrangements, as part of the consumer protection arrangements for untimed calls, limits the 25c; that cannot go up. That stays in place until December 1998. I think I have talked about that previously in the parliament and the former minister will know about that. The CPI minus 7.5 price cap formula for the basket of services, SID and IDD, is there also. I wanted to make one particular point about the issue of untimed calls. There is a clear intention of the government in this legislative package that untimed calls for voice and data be available to residential users of telecommunications services. It is legislated that there will be untimed calls for voice traffic for business users. This was not previously part of the legislation, but it is now. Mr Lee-Didn't you write the policy?",48
15,Mr WARWICK SMITH,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I was but a humble person in private enterprise at that particular time. It is not for other services for businesses. There is no obligation, and there never was a legislated obligation, to provide untimed call charges for data for use by business. What this package is all about is the development of a competitive environment. So with the emergence of carriage service providers and other operators they will obviously be going into the marketplace, they will be pitching and pricing packages to businesses to carry their data traffic, and some of it, I am sure, depending on the use by businesses, will mean that they will be able to enter into packages which will give them, even though it may be on a timed basis, a much lower cost than they would pay on the scheduled untimed basis. That is part of the competitive framework that is being developed here. That is the essential element of what is being presented to the parliament. This legislation package builds on what was proposed by the former government, now the opposition. It has been through extensive consultation. It has been through the Senate committee. The government believes that this will herald a new era in telecommunications. I want to take the opportunity-there may be another opportunity-to thank the advisers who have worked on this over a long period of time. (Extension of time granted) I think the former minister would also believe that this is a very complex area. This is a major package. It goes down the path for greater competition in telecommunications that was begun in this country in 1991-it was probably a little earlier than that, but is when we saw the legislative form take its place. To those people, and there are so many of them, we want to extend thanks. To all those people who made submissions to the Senate inquiry, those who have made representations, members from all sides, to Minister Alston about these matters, we say thank you. We think that there has been a long and constructive debate on this, but we have a legislative package that, once we get under way in the middle of the year, will see increasing benefits for consumers. After all, that is what this legislation is designed to dogive benefits to consumers. It is a broad micro-economic reform. It lowers the input costs to businesses by enhancing competition in the provision of services. Therefore, it is with pleasure that I commend all the amendments to the House as proposed and accepted by the government, as sent to us by the Senate.",50
16,Mr LEE,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"The opposition will not be seeking to force any of these amendments to a vote or a division. Views have been placed on record in the Senate. I would like to briefly take up some of the issues the minister has raised this morning. First of all, taking a step back and looking at the broad picture, in many ways this brief discussion here this moming in the House of Representatives is the end point of a series of legislative packages that had their first origins way back in 1988. When you look at the path to liberalising our telecommunications market, it has taken a series of reform steps that both sides of the House hope will deliver lower prices for residential and business consumers which we think is good for the country. There has also been quite a dramatic improvement in the quality of service for consumers, there has been an improvement in the range of products and choices that consumers already have and there has also been a dramatic boost in employment in this very important industry, and Australia can be very proud of those changes. As we move from the duopoly to full and open competition we can only hope that that transition delivers more of that those benefits that have assisted consumers. During the two years that I had the honour to be the communications minister this was one of the most important issues we dealt with. Like the minister, I would like to place on record my appreciation of people such as Tony Shaw, Fay Holthuyzen, Rohan-if I could remember the other names I would mention the other staff-and the others who I am sure have worked very hard in making sure the government is properly advised of the consequences of some of the decisions it is taking. If I had any reservations it would be one that I expressed on several occasions to the people in the boxes, and that is that we as a country should have had a more ambitious timetable for the legislative package. Tony Shaw in particular might remember I was very keen to see if we could have this package drafted and distributed for comment through the last parliament. Unfortunately, given the enormous detail that was involved in such an ambitious reform, we were not able to meet that timetable. Because we did not make that cut off we lost nine months in a way that, as I have mentioned before in the House, was totally preventable. I will not labour that point. If we had been able to give the industry more than a few months notice of the detail of the reforms, that would have been much better for Australia, but politics is politics and as a result, unfortunately, the industry will know what the final law will be only a few weeks before it starts to take effect. Turning in detail to the amendments: half were accepted by the government-we appreciate that-and half were unfortunately rejected by a majority, or a tied vote in the Senate in some cases. First of all, the tion remains pleased that the bulk of the original Keating government package remains intact, although there are some significant changes, the most important being that you cannot deal with this package without acknowledging that selling off one-third of Telstra dramatically changes the role of the largest player in telecommunications in Australia. (Extension of time granted) The fact that the government and the opposition were able to reach agreement on a number of amendments says a lot for the way this process has worked. As the minister has said, there were successful amendments . on the review of digital data capability. We would have liked to have kept you to your promise to have that available to every person living in Australia by the 1 July this year but it is good to see that you have acknowledged that that is now impossible. We were able to reach agreement on industry policy, access for service providers-not just for AAP Telecommunications but for all service providers, so it was good to see Brian Perkins lobbying hard not just for his own company but for all the others who were out there snapping at the heels of the big players-and on the decision to extend the terms of reference of the review of telecommunications cable infrastructure. Unfortunately there were a number of amendments that were not successful. The minister touched on one and that was this issue of whether there should be untimed calls available to business for data calls. The reason the opposition pressed that is that before the last election the coalition promised to provide business with untimed calls-not untimed voice calls, just the bland promise of untimed calls. It is unfortunate that the ministerMr MCMullan-It was not a core promise.",51
17,Mr LEE,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"The shadow minister says that it was not a core promise, but it certainly was a call promise, if not a core promise. It is unfortunate that they are going to leave businesses exposed to timed calls for data, faxes, e-mail and the use of the Internet. As my very capable colleague Senator Schacht put it, on the very day the government anopposi- nounced a new small business policy, 'It voted to hit a large number of small businesses with the possibility of these new charges.' In particular he is referring there to the Internet service providers. So the introduction of timed data calls for businesses is something that we think is going to be inevitable because our amendments failed, but be it on the head of the government. The second area where we were unsuccessful-due to the fact that Senator Colston continued for some reason to vote with the government on almost every position that was put to the Senate-is that there is the chance that directory assistance charges may be introduced sooner rather than later. The opposition sought through amendments to ensure that directory assistance remains available on a free basis funded through the universal service obligation. On two occasions we have had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in this chamber state that the government would stick to Liberal Party policy, which is that there will be no charging for directory assistance. We have had the Prime Minister declare his position on two occasions but for some reason the chief executive of Telstra, Mr Blount, seems to be overruling the Prime Minister. On several occasions Mr Blount and his organisation, no doubt on his instructions, have been making it clear that they are going to continue to push their proposal for the introduction of a charge for directory assistance. Mr Blount tries to wrap this up in a nice sugar coated pill. He says, 'Sure, you will have this very bitter lemon tasting centre of the pill, which is the directory assistance charge, but wrapped around it will be a bit of sugar. The sugar will be a reduction in your quarterly rental.' The problem is that any reductions in quarterly rental can be clawed back by Telstra in future increases in quarterly rental, centre of that lolly, that bitter piece of lemon, is going to keep growing year by year. every time you make a call on directory assistance you will get hit with that very bitter taste. As a result, we think that when the governgovernment ment-despite the Prime Minister's assuranperiod ces-finally succumbs to Mr Blount's instrucpanies tions, when the government finally carries out tember 1997. Mr Blount's policy, when the minister finally allows Mr Blount to do what he has made clear he is going to keep doing, it is quite clear that ordinary Australians will be paying for directory assistance. And that is something which we think is unfair, especially to elderly Australians who have difficulty reading text in some of the telephone directories. On the question of mobile towers, this the only question I will be putting to the minister during this discussion. It is my understanding that the government is about auction off some 1800 megahertz spectrum and that that is to be the next generation mobile wireless telephony products. I think it their cable. is commonly called-or used to be calledPCS; I do not know if it still is. But it is understanding that these signals travel only about half the distance of the current analog and particularly the digital mobile telephone calls. (Extension of time granted) And if that is the case, that the new systems travel half the distance, does that mean we are going to see a doubling in the number of base stations or wireless services in order to port this new 1800 megahertz service? So could the minister clarify that. I had certain piece of advice when I was the minister, and I would be very keen to know whether that is the case because, this whole issue of the approval of new mobile telephone base stations will be one that will be of great interest to consumers. Next we have an issue that we unfortunatehead ly achieved a tied vote on, and that is on the question of the government deciding to give the cable companies an extra three months to roll out their overhead cable, despite the fact that for almost five years now the former government had made it clear that any exemptions from state and local government planbut the ning rules would end on 1 July 1997. Optus Vision has known that for years. And Optus Communications has known that, Telstra has known it. Every company operating this market knows that the rules change on 1 July. So we do not understand why the has deliberately extended the of the exemption for the cable comfor another three months till 30 SepIn particular, it is going to make a big difference to the people of Adelaide, who will probably have quite an extensive overhead cable network installed in their city because there was a tied vote in the Senate-28 all, with only the Liberal and National Party the senators, joined by Senator Mal Colston, giving the government that 28-all result. is Unfortunately, Senator Harradine abstained-I am not sure why. But if Senator Colston or Senator Harradine had voted with the Labor to opposition and the Democrats and Greens, it would have denied the overhead cable comof panies that three-month extension to roll out The final matter I wish to raise concerns the my issue of discriminatory pricing. Despite the fact that the government has rejected the opposition's measures on this issue, we remain opposed to a partly privati sed Telstra having the ability to reduce local call prices only in mainly wealthy-in many cases, North Shore-electorates, in places like Hunters Hill, Chats wood and other places in northern supSydney. We believe that any reductions in that 25c local call rate in Liberal electorates a should apply right across the board-not just in the western suburbs of Sydney but in regional towns such as Bathurst, Launceston, no doubt, Ballarat and Bendigo. We think that if Telstra has sufficient fat in its profit to lower the price of local calls in the areas where Optus Vision is competing to head with Telstra, then Telstra should lower those local call prices right across its network to make sure that, wherever Australians live, they get the benefits of the competition-because Optus Vision is rolling out a network only in certain parts of Australia's capital cities and, if we are not careful, the greatest competition is going to be in those suburbs, sometimes in those streets of those suburbs, of those capital cities. It is our very strong view that there should have been a legislative obligation for a partly privati sed Telstra to have passed on those price reductions to anyone. It is certainly reassuring to know that, because a future government has the power to direct Telstra, a future Labor government would have the power to make sure that, even though our amendments may have been defeated, we retain the right to use that power of direction in the ways that have been expressed in this parliament on many occasions. Finally, I would be grateful if the minister would clarify that point about the 1800 megahertz wireless telephony. If we are going to face a doubling of the number of base stations, then I think it is probably fair that Australians who are concerned about the environment learn about that before the government decides to auction off that 1800 megahertz spectrum.",52
18,Mr WARWICK SMITH,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (10.43 a.m.)-I thank the shadow minister for the indication that the opposition will be assisting with the passage of these several amendments for this major legislative package which will establish a new telecommunications regime in this country. I acknowledge the shadow minister's own role in developing the legislation while he was minister, and I think the outcome here today is certainly a very constructive one. In response to the pes or 1800 megahertz distribution and sale, that will be proceeding. There will be a requirement, if the market does in fact take up that opportunity, which I believe they will, for there to be new transmitting capacities. The regime we are putting in place to take account of the extensive consultation and a range of concerns about the erection of mobile phone towers is to ask carriers to extensively pursue the collocation opportunities, and we would imagine that collocated facilities and towers with the capacity of new services to also be attached to them will be one avenue. There will be more stations required, but they will be physically different in many respects, in size, to mobile phone towers. I am advised they will be smaller and only be erected under the new consultative arrangement. They will be subject to state laws, with local governments being involved far more than they have been at present with mobile phone towers. The new provisions do actually formally require this collocation unless it is technically feasible not to do so. We believe that the regime that will be developing and the emergence of this new technology-which you correctly say will not have the same range; pes means personal communications systems-will mean that there will be a need to have repeaters closer together, but they will be qualitatively different to mobile phone towers as such and many of them may be able to be attached to mobile phone towers, for which they will be developing collocated arrangements. They will be subject to state and local laws. In that sense, on the issue you are referring to about the concerns of residents about the environmental and aesthetic impact of such facilities, the regime will be much more responsive than the regime that has existed prior to this. That is a concern we have taken into account, and we believe in practice we will get outcomes that will be sensible. Briefly, you did mention the other point about price discrimination. The government doesn't believe that a prohibition on price discrimination is a sensible policy in an open market as it will severely inhibit the emergence of additional competition in local call markets. I think I have addressed that in the past, but I just want to respond to that, to set the principle down again.",54
19,Mr LEE,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I will make this my last contribution, to help the House. First of all, on discriminatory pricing, we accept that the government and the opposition have different opinions. When the people in towns like Ballarat, Bendigo, Launceston and Bathurst don't get the discounts that people that live in Hunters Hill get, we are going to tell them to ring you, which might be good for Telstra's revenue. I am sure people will hold you responsible when they don't get those discounts passed on, especially in Launceston. We are going to make sure that the people in Launceston learn. Mr Warwick Smith-I'll be making sure they get them in Launceston!",54
20,Mr LEE,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Unless you direct Optus Vision to start stringing cables in Launceston, I don't think you will get those cuts. As my last point, I just want to revisit this issue of mobile towers and the 1800 megahertz. My understanding is that, even if Telstra puts in the 1800 megahertz base stations on every current Telstra mobile tower, that will still only provide half as many towers as Telstra would need to provide a network of adequate technical capability. Telstra itself, which seems to have a policy of not collocating with Optus or Vodafone, will have to put in twice as many base stations, on towers or on top of church steeples or on top of home units. Telstra will have to double the number of mobile base stations that it has if Telstra is successful in putting in that 1800 megahertz signal. That is my understanding of it. If the minister can confirm that, it will make it clear that that is what we are facing. The community should know what we are facing before that 1800 megahertz spectrum is auctioned off.",55
21,Mr WARWICK SMITH,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (10.48 a.m.)-I don't like to prolong a conversation between a lawyer and an engineer about a technical matter. It puts me at a disadvantage. I would say that, with the 1800 megahertz distribution, the PCS take-up will obviously be driven by market demand. There may need to be more stations beyond the collocation that is possible on mobile towers. It won't necessarily be to the extent that you say. It will depend on demand. Because they are qualitatively different in their size, and because we will require that state law and local government be involved in the siting of any of these facilities, we believe that the prospect of a proliferation of the concerns and arguments we have seen-as you know, I certainly saw a lot of them in a former capacity that I held-will not be nearly as difficult and that the community concerns about aesthetics primarily will be taken account of. The point I am trying to make is that you could construct a case that there is going to be a proliferation but, in actual fact, the market may not see such a rapid take-up of PCS. I believe there will be a take-up of PCS, but the government has taken a policy position that we believe will cater for the con.cerns that you allude to. We will certainly be keeping the matter under close scrutiny and monitoring it, particularly the changes that we have made that require collocation. As I understand it, there is no intention to do anything other than what we have already stated with regard to the 1800 megahertz distribution.",55
22,Mr LEE,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Finally, I am happy if the minister might like to take that one on notice, and either drop me a note or arrange a dorothy dixer at question time today and speak about this. My understanding is that it is nothing to do with the number of people using the system. It is more to do with the coverage and the quality of the service. In particular, I would be interested in what would happen to Telstra if Telstra continued its policy of not sharing infrastructure with Optus and Vodafone. Whatever the regulations are, Telstra has had an obligation to share and collocate, unless not technically feasible, for several years now. But, for some reason, Telstra has very rarely collocated with Optus and Vodafone. If Telstra continues that policy, doesn't it mean that Telstra will have to double the number of base stations? If you could take on notice, that is fine. Could I finish my remarks by extending not just to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) but also to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) my regards on getting this package through. There are some things in here we have worked with in cooperation with the government to achieve. There are a few other things that we object to. There are a few other things we would have liked to have seen added on. But there is no doubt whatsoever that this package does move forward the progress of telecommunications reform in Australia.",55
23,Mr WARWICK SMITH,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (10.52 a.m.)-I thank the opposition shadow minister, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), for his remarks and I will certainly relate them to the very capable Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston. I conclude by saying that I will take that matter on notice. You can be assured that a strong and purposeful government, with legislative backing and the community's interest uppermost in its considerations, will ensure that Telstra will abide by both the spirit and practice of the legislation to ensure that the outcomes are as the parliament would wish. The parliament, by its very actions this morning, has unanimously supported this legislative package. I am sure Telstra will be reading my remarks closely. Question resolved in the affirmative.

25,Ms MACKLIN,AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS,"Jagajaga) (11.03 a.m.)SENATE This bill is not what it seems. It does seem, at first glance, to give legislative backing to the government's pre-election promise that social security and veteran's affairs pensions would be maintained at at least 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. But closer scrutiny reveals that, in fact, it does no such thing. It actually limits the pre-election undertaking by inserting a sunset clause into the legislation. This means, of course, that the pension benchmark adjustment will not apply after 20 September 2002. All pensioners need to know that their benchmark is guaranteed until 2002 but not thereafter. From that date, pensioners will have no certainty that their incomes will be maintained. Once again, the government is striking at the most vulnerable groups in the community and, once again, its pre-election promises are proving to be meaningless because the same individuals who will, in five years time, be faced with uncertain and declining incomes are the very people who were promised before the election that their concessions and other benefits would not be touched. The Liberal and National parties' social security policy in February 1996 stated: The coa1ition will maintain a1l current Commonwea1th concessions. What is the position one year later? In the first budget-it only took one budget-the coalition cut $% billion from concessions for people on social security payments and other low income people. They abolished the Commonwealth dental health program, depriving four million concession card holders of access to free dental care. It increased the cost of prescriptions by 50c for card holders but failed to increase the pharmaceutical allowance to offset the increase. It reduced eligibility for Commonwealth hearing services. It abolished concession cards for 35,000 people; 29,000 recipients will lose their health care card from July and 6,000 former pensioners have lost their pensioner health card since their pensions were cancelled after the introduction of a modified income test. The government is also introducing two new fees for nursing home residents. We see from leaked documents from the Department of Health and Family Services that the next budget is going to be even worse. We believe that pensioners and beneficiaries can expect even more pain from the next budget. The documents show, for example, that pharmaceutical benefits alone are going to be cut by $800 million. Pensioners are bearing the brunt of the government's move to user charges. For example, they have to pay 20 per cent of the cost for home and community care. In relation to entry to nursing homes, we are seeing the introduction of up-front fees and new daily fees where previously none were payable. One of the most important omissions in this bill before us today is any reference to the benchmarking of allowances, such as the pharmaceutical allowance, or any mechanism for maintaining the current relativities between the rates of pensions and the rates of allowances. Nor is there any indication that the coalition is intending to make ad hoc increases to allowances to maintain or improve relativities, as Labor did in office. in the period during which the benchmark applies over the next five years we have no guarantee that the real value of associated allowances, most importantly the pharmaceutical allowance, will be maintained. So, once again, we are seeing a demonstrated lack of concern for pensioners and beneficiaries. The government's real agenda, as far as this issue is concerned, was most accurately demonstrated, not in its pre-election documentation, not in its pre-election commitments to the people of Australia and to pensioners, but in the report from the National Commission of Audit which was directed specifically to look at this issue. The truth came out in a letter, attached to the National Commission of Audit report, from a deputy secretary to the Treasury to the executive officer of the National Commission of Audit where he says: At a recent meeting of the Prime Minister,so he is not talking about the views of the bureaucracythe Treasurer and the Minister for Finance, there was some discussion of the current policy of benchmarking the level of the aged pension against 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. It was suggested that this issue could be considered by the National Commission of Audit. In particular, the ministers want the National Commission of Audit to examine which particular measure of AWE is the most appropriate. As you know, the current benchmark is expressed in terms of average weekly earnings for males. The National Commission of Audit's terms ofreference clearly encompass such issues and I understand you intend to consider this particular issue. However, I thought I should pass on the minister's interests in question. Let us have a look at how the National Commission of Audit interpreted these views. The commission saw real dangers to Commonwealth finances in continuation of the status quo-that is, in continuation of having the benchmark related to male total average weekly earnings. They said that 'this male total average weekly earnings benchmark risks being perceived as a social security entitlement' . I would have to say it should not have been seen as a risk because it was a promise by the government before the election. They went on to say: It weakens incentives to save for retirement and incentives to find employment. Even The commission, therefore, recommended the following: An assessment should be made of the relevance of male total average weekly earnings to benefit adequacy at the present time, particularly in the light of changes in the sex composition of the work force. As my colleague the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) and I would put to you very strongly, we certainly do not have equal pay and, under this government, have no prospect of getting equal pay. So it will be very important for us to keep a benchmark of male total average weekly earnings if pensioners are to keep up their level of benefit. The commission also recommended consideration of the following option for change: That pension and other benefits be adjusted only on the basis of regular reviews in light of relevant circumstances. So that is a complete walking away from the commitment before the election, a complete walking away from maintaining the level of buying power of pensions by saying it should be related to budget pressures. That, of course, is just code for saying, 'We'll have a look at it every year and see what we think, but we certainly won't guarantee that people will have a benchmark.' Secondly the commission recommended that adjustment of pensions and related benefits for past CPI changes with other adjustments be subject to periodic review in light of budget circumstances. If an average weekly earnings benchmark is still to be employed, consideration should be given to median total average weekly earnings. 'That is a better measure of community standards,' was the way it was put. Of course, because women are paid less than men-and certainly the future does not hold out any hope that will change under the new industrial relations laws of this country-that means that pensions would come down. If an average measure is to be used, the commission went on to say, total average weekly earnings should be used in place of male total average weekly earnings. This represents the true view of the government, I would suggest. In addition, the commission recommends that consideration be given to decoupling aged pension rates and unemployment related benefit rates to prevent pension adjustments automatically flowing onto employment related benefits. So we might have a benchmark of something less for pensions, but we certainly would not want that pension benefit flowing onto those who, unfortunately, are unemployed. When the report was initially tabled, the Labor Party drew attention to this aspect of findings pointing out the implications of the commission's recommendations. In the least damaging case where male total average weekly earnings would be replaced by average weekly earnings, there would be a reduction of nearly 16 per cent in the value of pensions. In the more damaging case where no benchmark was set-that is, past the next five years, if this sunset clause goes through-and unemployment rates were decoupled from the aged pension rates, there would be no certainty about income levels at all for any recipients of government benefits. The only certainty would be that they would fall. As a consequence of pressure, the coalition did back off from its proposal to move away from benchmarking at male total average weekly earnings to benchmarking at total average weekly earnings, but now we see from this legislation that is before us today that this is but a temporary retreat. We have no guarantee of any benchmark of any entitlement beyond five years. We also have no guarantee in the meantime whatsoever from this government that pensions will not be whittled away by increases in other charges, most particularly for medicines, home care and nursing homes, to name but a few. There is no doubt that Labor has embarrassed the Howard government into moving this amendment before us today because, of course, we saw the dangers to pensioners that were represented by recommendations in the audit commission report. We did call for the benchmark to be enshrined in legislation, but we did not call for a sunset clause and we certainly did not call for it to exclude any relationship with allowances. We certainly do not want future governments-nor do we want this government-to be able to meddle with pensioners' incomes. The government's view of the future is, in my view, not accurately reflected in its policy statements before the election or in the promises that were made to the pensioners of Australia about their incomes. All those promises have gone out the window. Pharmaceutical fees, home care fees, nursing home fees are all code words for taxes. All these its things are not affected by this benchmark. What we really will see come to the fore are the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit that the government move away from any commitment to pensioners about their incomes. We will be opposing the sunset clause in this legislation in the Senate and we will be inserting new provisions to maintain the relativity between the rate of the pension and the rates of allowances to make sure that the incomes of pensioners in Australia are maintained, as was promised by this government before the election and as is absolutely imperative to maintain their standard of living.",66
26,Mr TONY SMITH,AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS,"I am trying to resist the temptation to respond to some of the absurd, ideological claptrap that we hear so frequently from the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), but I have had to give into that temptation and at least make some response. It really does not help the debate to go about in the Australian community, as the honourable member does, and scare old people. That is what she does every day in this House. She deliberately misrepresents, she deliberately obfuscates the system and she deliberately abuses the trust that old people have in our political structure by trying to convince them that something is going to happen other than what is going to happen. She is trying to say that the government has some sort of hidden agenda designed to strip away from the older people of this country their entitled and just benefits. That is the she runs every time she speaks in this House. It is one that is unacceptable to this side of the House, and it is one that you can easily see through when you examine the proposals that are before the House. It is also an unrealistic line. It is interesting, isn't it, when you compare the contribution of the member for Sydney  the member for Jagajaga? The member for Sydney conceded, I think quite reasonably, that a number of difficult decisions had to be taken during the period of the Hawke government in this area. And they were difficult political decisions. I really regret that the member for Jagajaga was not part of that government because perhaps the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) would have realised his ambition in the 1980s to become Prime Minister. The decisions that were taken at that timeand they were difficult decisions taken in the mid-1980s, as is conceded by the member for Sydney, that caused a lot of political pain for the now opposition-were, in my view, forward looking decisions that had to be taken then and that have to be taken now, when we look ahead and when we look at the provision in relation to the sunset clause. That is a decision that also has to be made in the context of a realistic assessment of the ageing population that we have in this country. It may have escaped the attention of the member for Jagajaga but, if you look at Britain, it is a fact that by the year 2010, on present trends, they will be unable to pay their pensioners. So something has to happen to the system to ensure that that situation is covered. As far as the member for Jagajaga is concerned, she just wants to go on blithely frightening the people of Australia who are elderly and infirm to try to show that this government has no heart and no compassion for those people. I can tell you that this government has a forward looking plan contained in the legislation and in the commitment that has been made by way of this measure. The measure maintains election promises. It maintains its commitment to both pensionline ers and veterans. It maintains the 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. The flow-on is maintained to the partnered adult rate of the pension at 83 per cent of the single adult rate of pension. In this low inflation regime, in real terms, this measure keeps pensioners ahead. Indexation occurs in March and September. The figures for male average weekly earnings are obtained as at that date on which the percentage level is assessed. The ageing population is a matter of increasing concern in terms of the provision of pensions and benefits. In Australia, it is interesting to tum to some figures on that matter. It might assist the member for Jagajaga to reflect on these figures occasionalIy. In 1971, there were one million Australians aged 65 and over. Now there are two million. By 2031, there will be five million in this group. In Queensland, for example, seven per cent of the population is over 65. In my electorate of Dickson-and, in particular, in the Pine Rivers area of that electorate, which is the major part of the electorate-no-one could be more aware than me of those trends within the community. Something I encourage all members to do is to be involved in Meals on Wheels. That is an example of getting at the coalface and seeing precisely how people on pensions and benefits are managing to cope, and how we can help them at a practical level-not foist upon them rhetoric and fear tactics and scaremongering, but actually help them and try to see what their real needs are. That is, I think, the best education of all in this debate. It is important to look at those figures. I might mention also the figures in relation to veterans, because they are also covered by this measure. More than 30 per cent of veterans throughout Australia are now over 75 years of age, and by the year 2000 this number will have doubled to about 60 per cent. They are quite dramatic figures. There is this debate that we have an endless ability to pay for pensions and we have an endless ability to keep this situation locked in without looking ahead and without trying to be realistic about it. I disagree with any proposition that people can go through life as they will, making no provision for their future and just basically shrugging their shoulders and saying, 'The government will look after us at the end of it all.' That really is a notion in society that we have to dispel. That is a notion that the opposition want to accept forever but it is a notion that needs to be dispelled because the country cannot afford to go through life with that notion. It is important to ensure throughout the debate on this matter that we do not go off on a rhetorical tangent, as the opposition members sitting at the table constantly do in their contributions to this debate. We need to look at the more reasoned examples by people like the member for Sydney and more particularly the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson). I would like to refer to something the honourable member for Bradfield said in his contribution to the debate last night. I think it is worth quoting; it is worth reminding members opposite about it. He said: ... as the population ages; as the Internet becomes increasingly used; as we see growing income disparity in Australia; as we move into an environfashion ment of international competitiveness; as a lessening proportion of income earners in Australia, compared with those relying on social security benefits, develops; as the economy globalises; as we realise that public sector deficits are no longer sustainable; and we become increasingly aware of the vertical, fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states, it seems quite obvious to me that until we simplify Australia's taxation system it is going to be increasingly difficult for people to create more wealth in this country. Equally, until we broaden the tax base, whenever that may be, the government of the day will have no option but to continue to review necessary government spending programs. We cannot forever continue to tax productivity, employment and savings. I think the people who are suffering most from the narrow nature of the taxation base are those who most benefit from government spending. I think it is worth reflecting on those remarks in the context of this debate because that is the reality. The myth is what you get from the other side. The myth is that we are trying to attack the elderly and that we have some sort of agenda to downgrade pensions, to reduce the contributions and that, somehow, in five years time with the operation of the sunset clause we are going to suddenly cut out the pension. That is the implication you get but the more realistic contributions are from people like the member for Sydney and other reasonable people on all sides of the House. They are saying that we do have to ensure that there is going to be a capacity to pay in the community and that our elderly people, including veterans, have the dignity and the standard of living which they deserve. Most members on this side of the House would accept that proposition. This is a good measure; it is a realistic measure. It is one that takes into account the fact that we do have an aging population. It shows a plan for the future. It is not head in the sand; it is one that shows we realise that eventually we will have to continue to adjust the social security network as well as ensure that the safety net is protected throughout in order to maintain a real pension for veterans and older people. So in that context and in the context of the comments of the member for Bradfield and others who have considered the measure in a reasonable and non-rhetorical I commend this matter to the House.",69
27,Mr WARWICK SMITH,AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) 01.27 a.m.)-I apologise on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, who unfortunately is detained. I have been asked to sum up on this debate. I thank those members who have made a contribution to the debate on this extremely important piece of legislation which was a commitment by the government at the last election to give legislative effect to maintaining the single adult rate of pension at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings as well as continuing the existing relativity between the single and married rate of pension. This matter has been long sought by pensioner groups right around Australia. This government is particularly pleased to be able to bring this legislative package to the parliament. It has been brought forward by my colleague Senator Newman, the Minister for Social Security. There are a couple of points that should be made. Firstly, the opposition has circulated an amendment which I indicate the government will reject. I will address some of the matters in it. The first relates to there being a five year sunset clause. Broadly speaking, the government takes the view that it would be financially sensible and the proper financial management of a matter such as this to have a review in five years. The sunset clause ensures that that will take place and that the government of the day will review it to ensure that it is the best method of maintaining pensions at a rate that will preserve the social security safety net. This is all about establishing a benchmark that has been broadly agreed to be an appropriate thing. It would be improper to make an indefinite budget commitment and not review the commitment at a later date. Indeed, if one has a look at the explanatory memorandum to this bill one will see that the quantum of the benefit that will flow from this momentous decision of the government will see over a billion dollars provided to pensioners in Australia by the year 2000. So we are talking about a very large amount of money. That is why the government wants to be in a position to review it in five years time. It is primarily driven by the need to have proper financial management but also to ensure that the pensions are going to be appropriate when they are delivered in five years time, to ensure that the social security safety net will be in place. The second point is that maintaining the pension at two indexation points each year ensures that the most recent figures released by the ABS will be utilised to determine the rate. There has been some concern about this issue from the opposition, but I would make the point that-as I am advised and as I understand it-the methodology we are applying here to determine the indexation point is the methodology that you yourselves used previously. I would have thought that this would be something you would recognise, because it is the best practicable legislative approach to the matter. The other matter that you raise is that of the related increases flowing on to related allowances-this is item 3 in your amendment. The bipartisan commitment from all parties was for there to be a 25 per cent male total average weekly earnings benchmark for pensioners, especially aged pensioners. Given the need to target taxpayers' funds correctly, it was considered that pensioners--especially the aged and disability support and sole parent pensioners-rely on social security support for longer periods of time on average and are, therefore, the people most in need of having their base level pension protected. I would have thought that would be accepted. What this legislation does is enshrine the bipartisan commitment for all pensioners, without qualification. The opposition should recognise that all allowees will continue to have their allowances indexed to follow cost of living increases as measured by the CPl. In a sensible and fiscally responsible way, the legislation enshrines the government's commitment to maintain pensions at a minimum of 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. Under the legislation, pensions will be reassessed twice a year to ensure that they are increased for CPI increases or 25 per cent of the male total average weekly earningsbenchmarked-whichever is the greater: and I stress 'whichever is the greater'. For all their posturing and interjections, the ALP has never put money aside in the budget forward estimates in the way that we are doing with this piece of legislation. That point needs to be made quite strongly. This proposal is momentous in its intent, because there has been argument for this to be established in legislation for many years. I recall the pensioners association in my area arguing for this when I was first elected in 1984. They were given promises by Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating which were never delivered upon. We had 13 years of cynicism and tempting pensioners with this fundamental reform, and it was never delivered. Here we are, just over 12 months into this new government, and this piece of legislation today gives effect to that promise which has been broadly supported by the aged community right across this country. So r believe they will welcome this decision and, certainly, this legislation. There have also been some comments made about the National Audit Commission findings. This legislation is the clearest possible response to the National Audit Commission findings. Anything you say about that is clearly politically driven to scare pensioners. You must address the fundamentals of this legislation. As you know, this establishes a benchmark and, therefore, the legislation is in itself the clearest and most positive response from the government to the National Audit Commission report. And anything you say on that can be described as nothing more than scare tactics. It is also important to see this in the broader context of what the government is doing for aged Australians. In the last budget we delivered a number of major initiatives to older Australians. A lot of that was in the paper recognising older Australians released by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and also my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott)-and a very good paper it was too. They were very positive steps that have been taken for older Australians, and this measure gives them some financial stability and a clear legislative response to their needs, for the first time providing money in the forward estimates to pay for the 25 per cent average weekly earnings commitment. This is the first time that has happened. And, as I said, by the time you get to the year 2000, in our own documentation-the explanatory memorandumover a billion dollars is a provision. Even the shadow minister would have to recognise that this is the first time that has ever happened. You might have wanted it when you were the minister, but you could not get it past Mr Keating, because he did not care about older Australians whereas our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and our very compassionate Minister for Social Security understand these issues. The Minister for Social Security has fought particularly hard for older Australians. There has been greater assistance given to widows and partners. There has been a streamlined service to pensioners who deal with both the DSS and DV A. For the first time, we have one-stop shops in regional areas, where people can go in and get those services.

28,Mr WARWICK SMITH,AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS,"You might have talked about it, but you did not do it, and that is what this debate is all about, Shadow Minister. You talked about it for 13 years; you did not deliver it. All we saw from you was a range of cynical responses, often announced prior to elections. I was here. I knew what was going on. I saw it. I have many pensioners in my area. You talked about it, but you did not deliver. What this government is doing is delivering. There is greater recognition of support for war widows. There is incentive to take out and maintain private health insurance. There is structural reform of aged care, in order to stop the long-term decline of nursing home accommodation presided over by your government for the last 13 years. These are tough decisions that have been taken, but we have had the needs of older Australians uppermost in our minds. When you look at the totality of the package, we are providing them with security and certainty as they move into those very important years of their retirement. We have sought to introduce some sensible reforms which protect disadvantaged older people while ensuring a capital injection to bring nursing homes up to necessary standards. And standards are important. We want our older Australians to be provided care at a level that will meet their own requirements but which a nation such as ours can also be proud of. The government has looked after the interests of older Australians, particularly those who are disadvantaged. This is even more impressive in the context of the government's needing to fix up the government'sfiscal position as a result of the prior management of the now opposition leader. A country such as ours cannot provide for older Australians unless the fundamentals of the budget are correct. The opposition knows that. We cannot make provision for $1 billion for older Australians in this bill-as we are doing now-unless the economy is in a proper position. We have a responsibility to meet those twin goals. We are doing that. It is interesting that the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), who is at the table, and who supports the proposals to improve the position for older Australians through this measure, also has the responsibility to ensure that the nation's finances are managed responsibly. We are in a position where there is huge debt due to the huge outlays of the Labor government, and we have had to correct that. We have had to make some tough decisions, but what has been uppermost in our minds has been making sure that the disadvantaged in our community who have needs-and demonstrably so-get the benefits of taxpayers' funds in a proper and sensible fashion. This decision, made in the light of that fiscal background, should be applaUded by the whole parliament. Certainly, the nitpicking and the political bumph that are contained in item 4 of the opposition's amendment mean that that amendment should be seen for what it is-nothing more than an attempt to use scare tactics on older Australians, who are some of the most vulnerable people in our community. I have listened to these debates from the sidelines for many years, and it is only by sheer coincidence that I had the chance to speak today. The opposition should be acknowledging that the policy outcome enshrined in this piece of legislation presented by Senator Newman is a milestone in the development of age security, providing as it does a 25 per cent benchmark in a piece of legislation. People have argued for this-and I bet the shadow minister argued for this in his own cabinet. We have delivered it just over 12 months into this new parliament with this new Prime Minister (Mr Howard). That deserves celebration, not this rather petty amendment that has been proposed. With those few words, I conclude the debate. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Peter Baldwin's amendment) stand part of the question The House divided.

NA AMENDMENT (WORK FOR THE DOLE) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 March, on motion by Dr Kemp: That the bill be now read a second time.  a.m.)-The opposition regards the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997 as completely unacceptable in its present form. In the House I will be moving a second reading amendment NOES which outlines the broad basis of our concerns. I foreshadow that, in the Senate, a number of detailed amendments will be moved to correct what we regard as the grave deficiencies in this legislation. This piece of legislation prompts the question: exactly what is the government on about here? One thing we can say with confidence is that it is not on about having a serious impact on the rate of youth unemployment. In fact, as we all know, it is a piece of poll driven pandering to popular prejudice, designed to achieve a political objective rather than a substantive objective in the youth labour market. Government spokesmen have gone pretty close to conceding that this measure will have no major substantive impact on the problem of youth unemployment. They have conceded that the impact on the rate of PAIRS youth unemployment arising from this measure, as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, is likely to be negligibleunmeasurably small. They have also insisted that this is not a training program, in other words, there is no serious intent to impart recognised accredited skills to young unemployed people. If it is not about having a measurable impact on the youth unemployment rate and it is not about conferring specific skills on young unemployed people, what then is it about? In its rhetoric in support of this legislation, and in the second reading speech of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), reference has been made to the concept of mutual obligation. 'Mutual obligation' sounds rather familiar. It sounds rather like the term 'reciprocal obligation' which was central to the former government's concept of assisting the unemployed-that is to say, we, as a government, assume a responsibility to provide a wide array of assistance, services, access to labour market programs, and access to case management services and so forth. In exchange for that, we expect the unemployed person to make use of those opportunities, to actively seek work, to take up opportunities to participate in training and other programs which are designed to improve their employability and their skills, to participate in subsidised work experience programs which are designed to impart more generic capacities to people, as well as providing definite skills. So as we conceived of the concept of reciprocal obligation, it was a genuine two-way street. What the government has in mind here, through its term 'mutual obligation', which based on a dictionary definition is almost synonymous with reciprocal obligation, is a rather more unbalanced kind of relationship. What they want the young unemployed to do is to participate in work for the dole schemes that provide no accredited training and no significant case management services, none of the support services that, as a government, we regarded as essential for labour market programs to have any chance of having a worthwhile effect. In other words, this is a pathetic, mickey mouse scheme that will have a negligible impact on the problem of youth unemployment. At this stage the government is talking about 10,000 participants. Compare that to the numbers of young people in the same age group who had access to quality labour market programs under the former government with proper training wage arrangements and proper training provided, including programs that operated over the course of a full working week with combinations of work experience and accredited training. These have been slashed and vandalised by this government. Instead, we have this mickey mouse nonsense and other similar sorts of schemes like Green Corps and so forth. This is really some sort of belated recognition on the part of the government that something needs to be done about the problem of youth unemployment other than simply relying on the deregulation of the labour market and the other measures that they argued, before the election, would lead to a boost in business confidence, a surge in activity and so forth. I think it is clear by now that that particular combination of policies is not going to deliver the goods. That is best exemplified by what we see happening with the youth labour market. Since this government came to power, the trend figure for youth unemployment has edged up from 27.4 to 29.6 per cent. Before the election, as you would expect, the coalition sought to imply that 'elect them and the millennium will arrive and the major problems will be solved'. In fact, the problem of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment and youth unemployment, has got significantly worse since this government was elected. What is the government's work for the dole program all about? In government we accepted that young unemployed people should not simply be left to passively receive income support payments without any obligations. That was integral to our concept of reciprocal obligation. We did require, through activity testing and through activity agreements, young unemployed people, and unemployed people generally for that matter, to take up opportunities for work experience through subsidised jobstart places, training programs, programs which contained elements of both structured training and work experience such as jobskills or programs like the new work opportunities scheme or the landcare and environment action program, which were a form of direct job creation. Again, they provided both structured training and work experience. We did require young people to participate in such schemes. As part of Working Nation the whole set of arrangements in relation to reciprocal obligations were quite substantially tightened up and penalty periods were increased. That was done in the context of a very major commitment to the unemployed, as measured by the sheer magnitude of Working Nation. It was a four-year program. From memory, the total value of extra labour market assistance that was to be provided over that four-year period was of the order of $6Y2 billion. This was a major commitment by the former government-a recognition on the part of the former government-that it had a moral responsibility to ensure that the problem of unemployment was dealt with. The approach was built around the concept of reciprocal obligation. This mutual obligation that the government talks about in the context of the work for the dole scheme is a pathetic one-way street and is no substitute for our program. Even though the terminology is almost synonymous, it differs fundamentally from the concept that we had. In so far as it is possible to discern anything from statements by government ministers about what good they think this will do, sometimes they talk about the virtue of instilling a sense of work discipline into the young people concerned, which was precisely part of the rationale for many of the labour market programs that we had which they disparaged so much. They also imply that it is a case of people who are receiving something from a community paying something back. Therefore, the implication is perhaps that the work that might be done by young people on work for the dole schemes is of some community value. As I will come back to talk about later in this speech, the government's critique of former labour market programs seems to imply that those factors, as they operated under our substantial labour market programs, were of no significance. If you take the statements coming from government ministers you find that they have a rather schizophrenic attitude to the impact and potential benefit flowing from these sorts of schemes. The other point I would make that really highlights the true purpose of this legislation relates to the short title of the bill-the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997. I find this quite extraordinary. The term 'dole', as anybody who has followed public debates in this country over the last couple of decades would be well aware, is fraught with negative connotations. It is normally associated with and linked to terms like 'dole bludger'. It is overwhelmingly a pejorative term applied to people who have to receive unemployment benefit. Yet that piece of colloquial terminology, which reflects the worse kinds of community prejudices, is now to be formally incorporated into the short title of a piece of legislation. That says volumes about the attitude of this government and what it is fundamentally on about in this area. If Dr Kemp is to be believed, part of the purpose of this legislation is to raise the self esteem of the people concerned and, presumably by instilling work disciplines, improve their subsequent employability. Just imagine a young person going along to a potential employer and contrast what he might have to say to that potential employer after participating in work for the dole compared with our sorts of programs. Under our programs the young person could say, for example, that they had participated in LEAP, that is, the landcare and environment action program. They could go along and say to an employer that they had worked for six months on a community project designed to enhance and improve local conservation projects or landcare projects, that they had been paid a training wage and that, as part of that, they had acquired accredited and recognised skills or made recognised progress towards some vocational training award. Contrast that with a young person going to a potential employer soon, being asked what they have been doing for the last six months and saying, 'Oh, I have been working for the dole.' Is the government serious when it suggests that this is going to enhance the self esteem of young people? Is it serious that this form of participation is going to significantly enhance their employability and improve their image with potential permanent employers? I think it is utterly farcical. At the very least, this government could have selected a bit of different nomenclature in the title of the legislation. It is, of course, the government claims, part of its effort to address the problems of the youth labour market. And the problems of the youth labour market are very significant. There is no question about that. It is not just a problem that is unique to this country. We have seen a situation where, over the past couple of decades, a whole swag of former entry level jobs have been eliminated by technical change and other factors. For young people who do not have recognised skills and qualifications, entry into the labour market is undoubtedly a more difficult process than it used to be, because of that fundamental structural change that has gone on. The Labor government put in train a whole series of initiatives, the most significant of which were those arising from the 1991 Finn review of the participation of young people in post-compulsory education. Flowing from that was a recognition that access to quality training opportunities and education opportunities has to be made almost universal for young people by the tum of the century. As a recognition of that, in Working Nation we initiated a substantial upgrading of vocational education-a major boost in funding; the creation of the ANTA to provide a national framework for vocational education. Shortly thereafter, in response to a report from the then Employment and Skills Formation Council, which has now been abolished, we put in train a major reform process for the whole system of entry level training. This sought to broaden out very considerably the scope of traineeships; to achieve a more active involvement by industry in the whole process and to redevelop vocational education in formats that are far more flexible and which have at their heart a competency based approach-in other words, to comprehensively modernise the whole system of mainstream entry level training. Dr Kemp, in some respects, has carried on that process while claiming credit for it in its entirety, which is an absurdity. The reality is that just about all the things that are worthwhile in what the current government is doing are developments of initiatives or processes that were set in train by the former government. I do not disparage a number of the initiatives. I think a number of them are quite valuable. We support the move to a more flexible, simpler and more accessible training system, as we support the move to accelerate the introduction of vocational education and training options into the latter years of school. These were all things we initiated and were in the process of developing. I notice in answers to parliamentary questions that Dr Kemp, in arguing that we did nothing about this, has made reference to schemes like the jobs pathway guarantee, which was designed to smooth transition from school to work for school students, and the Australian Students Traineeship Foundation, which is designed to create a range of vocational opportunities with an emphasis on an element of work experience. These are all things that we put in train over the past few years, and throughout the country there has been a very considerable expansion of vocational education opportunities in schools. Dr Kemp is continuing to pursue that and w- are obviously pleased that he is. We are not so pleased that he tries to imply that we did nothing about the problem. The reality is that we instituted a very major program of reform in entry level training for young people. Returning to that whole issue of labour market programs and the way this government has disparaged them, I think it is important to bear in mind that there has been a substantial process of reform in our approach to this form of assistance that dates back to the Cass review of the social security system in the late 1980s. What we sought to do, over a number of initiatives since that time, was to move from a structure of assistance for the unemployed, the great bulk of which was overwhelmingly passive and took the form of passive income support, to a framework which is based on active measures. There was a major boost in labour market program assistance. If you look at comparative OECD statistics, this country was a relatively mediocre performer in that area up until the mid1980s. As a result of a succession of initiatives, when the government took office we were a mid-ranking OECD country in terms of the proportion of employment assistance that takes the form of active measures rather than simply passive income support. That shift again was not unique to this country. Within the OECD there was quite a debate about the right of approach to employment assistance. What we were doing involved a particularly large rise in assistance, but it was broadly consistent with thinking throughout the OECD area. That gain has been largely negated as a result of the $1.8 billion cuts in labour market programs that were announced in the last budget. In this shift to a more active approach, the reciprocal obligation concept was absolutely central. We did not just boost assistance for the unemployed; we also sought to provide more active assistance to other groups who tended to be excluded from the labour market-and I am referring to sole parents through the JET, or jobs education training scheme, and the disabled through the disability reform package. Again, in both those areas we moved to a much more active scheme of assistance than existed before. We were averse to the idea that whole categories of people ought to be written off and regarded as excluded from the labour market. We wanted to make access to the world of paid work as broadly accessible as possible to all people. The culmination of that process building and developing our approach to assisting the unemployed was the Working Nation statement. That obviously involved a major expansion in programs as a result of the cyclical recession that we had to cope with in the early 1990s. Nonetheless, in the process of responding to that cyclical phenomenon, we made a major qualitative improvement in the scale and the delivery of labour market program assistance. Working Nation was about avoiding a situation where we ended up in this country with a stagnant pool of people who might be unemployed for very long durations with minimal prospects of getting back into work. An explicit purpose of labour market program assistance, I might say, as well as having some impact on total employment, was to ensure that those most disadvantaged in the labour market were moved up the queue, so that you did not have a circumstance where a large number of people had no experience of work for very long periods of time and passed on to their children all the attributes and problems that you associate with long durations of unemployment. We were very concerned to avoid that, and that was a central purpose in labour market programs. As I said earlier, it was a $6.5 billion a year effort. I do not pretend, given that major expansion that we had, that we got everything right in terms of delivery. It is very important in spending money in these areas to ensure that you have an efficient delivery system that matches skills provided to requirements of local labour markets and that you are as responsive as possible to the needs and aspirations of individual people. That is why I was strongly supportive of the move we announced in Working Nation to shift towards a competitive market for case management serVIces. The present government has tried to claim that Working Nation was a huge failure. In making that claim they refer to a number of sources. Early in the piece and in the lead-up to the budget there was reference to an internal review, an evaluation, conducted by DEETYA of Working Nation that came out of gradually if.! July last year. The results of that report were comprehensively misrepresented by government ministers. The report did not say that Working Nation programs had been a failure. In fact, in discussing various of the Working Nation initiatives, it explicitly made the point that there had been some significant successes. I quote from the conclusion of that report in terms of the effect of labour market assistance for the unemployed: Net impact studies undertaken through DEETYA's evaluations have consistently shown that labour market programs enhance the employment prospects of participants. The net impact of programs is unlikely to have changed substantially since the introduction of Working Nation. These studies show that program participants are more likely to be employed some six to eight months after leaving the program than comparison groups of nonparticipants, matched on criteria such as age, gender, unemployment duration, education and location. Recent post program monitoring research shows that for most programs the proportion of participants in unsubsidised employment is slightly higher 12 months after program assistance than at earlier points. This suggests that the program net impact may also be sustained beyond the six to eight month mark. That is not exactly consonant with the claim that these programs have been an unambiguous failure. It goes on to make the point explicitly that it is too early to determine the overall success rate of the Working Nation strategy. So what does this government do? It takes some problems with the delivery of some of those programs and says, 'Let's throw the baby out with the bath water, junk the whole thing and massively slash labour market program assistance', including of course labour market assistance for the young unemployed. And that is the consequence of what the government has done. Quite a debate goes on about the efficacy of all these programs. There is no doubt that there are different perspectives put forward. I note that the government made frequent reference to an EPAC report last year which questioned the effectiveness of the programs. But again, in February of this year, two DEETY A officials, Greg Connolly and David Nicol, in a major paper critiquing the EPAC paper, explicitly dispute that claim and affirm that these programs do have a significant effect on long-term unemployment. The point is, though, that we were in the process of increasing the level of labour market assistance by an order of magnitude. We were inevitably going to be in the process of traversing a learning curve. Midway through the process, on the basis of an evaluation which clearly did not reject the whole approach as a failure, this government took the decision to scrap the whole thing. Instead of trying to correct any problems that might have emerged and making sure that the programs operate smoothly, they have decided to junk the whole thing. That shows their level of commitment to the young unemployed and to the unemployed generally. We believe that this government's entire approach to unemployment is flawed. That is becoming more and more apparent as time goes by. The numbers of long-term unemployed is now some 40,000 higher than it was in May of last year-up to 242,700. As I said earlier, the youth unemployment rate, in trend terms, is up by a couple of per cent. DEETY A's series of leading indicators, which are probably the best guide to future employment prospects, have been consistently negative for nine consecutive months. It is clear that this government's policies for the unemployed are not working. As to the claim that our approach was flawed, I don't say that we had it all right. But this government's attitude towards the unemployed, as exemplified in this legislation, is one of seeking mickey mouse politically palatable solutions that the latest poll shows will resonate out there in the electorate, putting forward bogus, spurious claims about the efficacy of the forms of assistance that we built up over a period of years. A classic example of that the other day was the claim that the new work opportunities scheme is a complete failure. The basis of that was the claim that the cost is $143,0000 per net employment outcome. That is a completely wrong methodology for working that out. The cost per program place, according to evidence given at the Senate committee, was about a tenth of that. I think Dr Kemp was talking about net additionality of four per cent per place. The key flaw with that whole methodology is what it assumes implicitly about the worth of the work done by people participating in such programs. Net additionality of four per cent implies you need to employ 25 people to get one net additional employment outcome. You need to have 25 people participating. The implication is that the work that those 25 people might have done over a six-month program-which I suppose translates into about 12 years of person labour in totalthrough community projects and other activities is valued at zero. It is absolutely ridiculous. The whole approach here is one that we believe to be fundamentally flawed. In the Senate, we will be seeking to amend this legislation. We do not regard it as in any way adequate. Our amendments in the Senate will try to remove some of the most objectionable features and to give it a bit of substance. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House: (1) is of the view that the Bill is unacceptable in its present form because it will: (a) displace existing workers; (b) lead to below award payments, particularly in the community services industry; (c) not guarantee participants accredited on or off the job training; (d) not provide appropriate case management and supervision to participants to assist them to make decisions about taking up any opportunities under the proposed arrangements; (e) not provide appropriate legislative coverage and financial support for workers' compensation, superannuation, occupational health and safety and industrial relations tion; (f) not guarantee placements for the minimum required period of 6 months; (g) not require organisations contracting to provide employment projects: (i) to state the proportion of people who will obtain permanent employment following the placement; and (ii) measure future contracts against performance in this respect; and (h) waste time and effort on further trials instead of replicating and building upon the successful aspects of real labour market and training programs under Working Nation such as LEAP and New Work Opportunities; and (2) also calls on the Government to apply the concept of reciprocal obligation to other sector outlays, especially financial assistance to large private sector corporations"". I urge honourable members to support our amendment. I hope the amendments we will be moving in the Senate will gain the support of the majority of senators. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-Is the amendment seconded? Mr Stephen Smith-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",72
29,Mr BARTLETT,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I am amazed that the shadow minister has the audacity to say that it is clear that this government's policies on unemployment are not working. His was a government that for 13 years failed to act on unemployment, that gave us the recession that we supposedly 'had to have', that drove unemployment to the highest level since the Great Depression. And it dares to say our policies on unemployment are not working! There is no doubt that unemployment has, for a number of years, been the biggest scar on the social and economic landscape in this country. The complexity of its causes and the enormity of its impact mean that there is no easy answer, either in terms of cause or effect. The proposals included in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill are one part of the armoury that needs to be applied in our fight against unemployment's devastating impact. They are protec- a weapon which should have been employed years ago, but which the former government didn't have the courage to apply. The former government was hamstrung by its own myopia and by its subservience to its union masters. The details of this legislation have already been presented to this House. In essence, they include the possible requirement for newstart r-cipients to work in return for the newstart allowance and a provision for recipients under 20 years of age to work 24 hours a fortnight and for recipients over 21 to work 30 hours a fortnight, with recognised training award wage rates applying. It includes the payment of an extra $10 a week in recognition of the extra costs incurred in working. Work for the dole will involve the trialling of around 50 public projects, concentrating largely in regional areas with the highest youth unemployment, and another 20 in other regions to give appropriate geographical distribution, with a possible later extension to other regions and to all age groups. When this policy was announced last month by the government there were howls of protest by the opposition and their partners, the Democrats, in the Senate. Yet the bulk of the community by far support this proposal. Why? They support it because it makes sense. They support it because it is good policy. It is good policy for a number of reasons. Firstly, this policy is fair and just. It recognises the principle of mutual obligations; it recognises that all members of society have obligations and responsibilities. Our rights, as members of society, carry with them commensurate responsibilities. It is a two-way street. As we receive from society on one hand, we also need to contribute. In respect of the unemployed, the government itself has two prime responsibilities: first, to do what it can to seek solutions to unemployment and, second, to provide an essential safety net for the unemployed. These are two obligations this government takes very seriously. On the other hand, for those who receive benefits, there is a reciprocal obligation-a responsibility, where possible, to contribute. These contributions can be significant. The 24 to 30 hours a fortnight involved in working for the dole will provide a valuable human resource for our local communities, for local environment work, for local community projects, for assisting the needy and the for an almost limitless range of worthwhile activities which are crying out for more manpower and more helpers. Here is a chance for the unemployed to contribute and for the community at large to benefit. Secondly, it is good policy because it will do a lot for the unemployed. This policy is about raising self-esteem. By far the majority of those who find themselves unemployed want to work. They want to do something; they want to earn their way, even if it involves part-time work. They despise the criticism, the often scathing looks and the pejorative dole bludger label. They reject the insulting comments of the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who callously and arrogantly derides the unemployed as spending most of their day in bed or watching TV. They reject the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) that they hang around the streets bothering people. They detest the despondency, the devastation and the despair of not feeling valuable and of not contributing. This despair manifests itself in many ways damaging and destructive to the unemployed. Dr Keith Woollard, President of the AMA, argues that youth unemployment is 'a massive strain on the health and well-being of young Australians'. Certainly it is. Most tragic of course is the impact on youth suicide as the most desperate response to youth unemployment. Admittedly, youth suicide has a multiplicity of causes, but, for young males particularly, unemployment is undoubtedly one of them. Anything which can be done to add some sense of fulfilment for the unemployed must be of value. Working for the dole gives them a start in escaping this pit of despair-to do something constructive, to do something to earn what they receive. It gives them a chance to hold their head up, to distinguish themselves from those who do not want to work and who do not want to have a go. It enables them to reject the dependency mentality that the Labor Party has been so often willing to foster. Closely related to this is the opportunity that work for the dole gives the unemployed aged, to be brought back from the periphery of society-to overcome the feeling of alienation, to reduce the glaring contrast between those who work and those who do not, to be participants rather than mere spectators. Sure, it is not as good as a full-time job-no-one is pretending it is. But it does give our unemployed a chance to be involved, and it is a lot better than doing nothing. Thirdly, this is good policy because it will help on the path towards employment. Working for the dole will have a number of positive spin-offs which will increase the chance of the unemployed securing a job. For the long-term unemployed, it will help them develop work habits and the commensurate discipline involved in working. Long periods of unemployment can often, tragically, lead to a loss of motivation and desire. It will carry with it training opportunitiessome formal-but, perhaps more important, it will give the inestimable informal training that comes with hands-on experience of actually being on the job and doing it. It will provide new experiences and possibly expand their horizons into new employment possibilities they had not even considered. It will allow them to develop a network of new contacts which may lead to employment opportunities. It is no wonder, given that work for the dole makes so much sense, that it has received so much community support. Apart from the notable merchants of doom and gloom on the other side and some predictable elements of the media, there has been widespread support. Calls to my office have been overwhelmingly positive; with several offers from groups keen to run a work for the dole scheme and many other offers of voluntary help to coordinate such a scheme. The Hawkesbury Independent, a magazine in my own electorate, carried out and published a survey-admittedly, it was a small survey-in which 88 per cent of the people interviewed agreed with the scheme. Typical of the comments are these: 'It's a great idea because it will give people more skills;' or, 'They should contribute to the community in some way and be doing something which will help their self-esteem;' or 'It will give them some input in life and they will learn how to work.' In a Herald-Sun survey of over 400 students-young people themselves who may well be involved-65 per cent of those young people said that they supported the introduction of a work for the dole scheme. Contrary to what the shadow minister says, very few were worried about the label of it. Perhaps one of the strongest messages of support in my own community in the Blue Mountains comes from Mission Employment Katoomba, a branch of the Sydney City Mission. Mission Employment has been working with young people for a long time. This is what the director of Mission Employment Katoomba said: Mission Employment Katoomba, as a major service provider within the Blue Mountains region ... is eager to support and get behind this bold new initiative of the Howard coalition government. We are keen to be involved with any process that provides a positive, proactive and locally based vehicle to help young people effectively move employment or make direct and immediate contact with appropriate local spheres of employment. The inherent high self esteem, work skills and community value of such a carefully structured, tored and evaluated program remains quite clear and is immediately self evident. Moreover, we have considerable numbers of local young people currently on our books who are not only keen to work but are also eager to make a positive contribution to their local community. They can see that such a program, properly administered and controlled, would be of tremendous value and an effective vehicle to help get that all important-real job. There has been a lot of myth and deception peddled by the opposition on this legislation. For that reason, I think it is important to look at what this legislation is not. First of all, it is not, contrary to the cries from the other side, demeaning or punitive. There is no way that working is demeaning. On the other hand, what is demeaning is to be dependent, to feel useless. Yet, on 12 March, the Leader of the Opposition on 2BL tried to push the line that we are going to punish kids in the western suburbs while we let kids in the better suburbs lie in bed. What a joke. What an appalling distortion, even by Labor's standards. Firstly, to provide an opportunity for the jobless to lift their self-esteem, to contribute to society and to develop new skills to increase their chance of employment is hardly punishment. Secondly, this scheme is going to be trialled in the areas of greatest need where there is the highest youth unemployment. Where else would you trial it? Would the opposition leader really want us to trial it in the areas where it is least needed? That is what his appalling interview was suggesting. I for one would certainly like to see a pilot scheme in my electorate of Macquarie, not because I want to punish anyone but because I want them to derive the benefits of involvement. Work itself is valuable, and to contribute in exchange for receiving assistance is in itself rewarding and fulfilling. Secondly, this scheme is not exploitative. Participants will receive the equivalent of the appropriate training wage for their age: 18to 20-year-olds, two six-hour days, the equivalent of $7.40 an hour; 21 and over, 21f2 sixinto hour days, the equivalent of $9.30 an hour. In addition, participants will receive an extra $10 a week in recognition of the unavoidable monicosts of working. Further, the government is committing upwards of $1,500 per participant to allow coordinators to provide meaningful work activities to ensure that participants derive the maximum benefit from their involvement. Thirdly, I am proud to say that it is not a copy of the massively expensive attempt to hide the unemployment figures that we had under the former government. Labor's failed Working Nation program, in spite of the brave front just put on by the shadow minister, cost taxpayers a mint and achieved little in terms of long-term results, particularly in their frenzied 'throw money at it campaign' leading up to the last election where the then minister spent half a billion dollars on the Working Nation program to get as many people off the unemployment books as possible. And the outcome was an appallingly low level of results. The Working Nation evaluation commissioned by the former government and done by DEETYA has said this, on page 36 of its evaluation of Working Nation: New Work Opportunities and Job Skills. ... the proportion of the participants going on to unsubsidised employment after assistance was relatively low. Or even this, on page 52: The large majority of new work opportunity participants were returned to unemployment allowances. This leaves the Job Compact open to charges of recycling clients from long term term unemployment rather than substantially improving their labour market prospects. Shame on the former government. It was about recycling, covering up the figures and moving people on the books from long-term to short-term unemployed, and they should be ashamed of it. After all of that the best the opposition leader could say about it was that, while many people did not get a job at the end of it, they were 'gainfully employed while they were on it and they weren't around the streets bothering anybody'. If that is the best that could be said at the end of a grossly expensi ve campaign, a wasteful program, of the former government's proposals and policies, it is pretty obvious why they are in opposition now. In fact, the figures show that there was no change in the level of full-time teenage unemployment over the entire time of Labor's failed Working Nation program. Not only was it a failure; it was an extremely expensive failure that in the case of new work opportunities for instance, in spite of the shadow minister's denials, cost taxpayers an estimated $140,000 for each new job obtained. This was a cost which ironically had job destroying repercussions in its ultimate impact throughout the rest of the economy. The Labor Party's approach is big spending, big government-the money comes out of thin air. What they fail to realise is that these projects cost money. That money came from taxes, that money pushed up interest rates, and that caused a shrinking of employment opportunities in the private sector. Their expensive programs not only failed to deliver but they squeezed out employment in the private sector. If they had been left there, they would still be squeezing out employment in the private sector. It was a wasteful, extravagant program to cover up the unemployment figures. It was also a failed merry-go-round which held up artificial false hopes and too often cycled unemployed people from one meaningless program to another. I met many who were frustrated and fed up coming out of one program that did them no good and being forced into another one that they knew was to short going to do them no good. Many young people had false hopes dashed. Yet the shadow minister had the hide a while back to tell us that they were considering increasing levels of assistance to this failed program. Fourthly, this is not a substitute for other policies. If you listen to the deliberate distortions of the opposition and some journalists, you would think this is the government's only approach to the problem. It is not and it has never been presented that way.",80
30,Unknown,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Opposition members interjecting,83
31,Mr BARTLETT,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Just listen, instead of interjecting, and you will find out. This program on its own is not the answer to unemployment; it is part of a long list of other policies which will solve these problems.",83
32,Unknown,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Opposition members interjecting,83
33,Mr BARTLETT,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Listen and you will hear them. These policies rightfully constitute a three-pronged attack that is necessary, firstly, to increase the job readiness of the unemployed-to increase their employabilitysecondly, to minimise the structural barriers to unemployment that you put in place and, thirdly, to increase economic growth in a sustainable way so that there is an increasing demand for labour. The government has already been tackling these. For those of you with memory loss, let me spell some of this out. First, reform of the apprenticeship system: Labor had let apprenticeships fall to the lowest level for 30 years. This government is attempting to reverse this with a package of $207 million over four years for new apprenticeships. Second, a 9.8 per cent increase in vocational education and training, to $889 million in the last budget, including extra assistance at the senior secondary level. Third, an emphasis on job pathways to make the important link between school and work, including the establishment of job broker contracts-already in 40 regions across Australia with many more to come. Fourth, additional funding of $45 million for literacy and numeracy to provide for early intervention to prevent the problems which so easily lead to unemployment. Fifth, the establishment of the $41 million Green Corps program to give young Australians a chance to work full time on environmental restoration. These are only the start. We have acted to remove some of the structural barriers that you put in place. Industrial relations reform that your union bosses would not let you tackle has paved the way for the negotiation of arrangements of mutual benefits that will encourage new employment. There is to be an end to Labor's now legendary job destroying unfair dismissal laws which typified and embodied much of what was wrong with Labor's approach to unemployment. A reduction in interest rates will make it easier for business to borrow and invest. There is a raft of other measures, both in last year's budget and in yesterday's response to the Bell report on small business, to make it easier for small business to invest, to grow, to expand and to hire. I will list some: a reduction in the tax impost; a reduction in the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax; a single registration process; and greater flexibility in raising finance. I could go on ages about those. They are policies that will assist small business to employ and to give young people a chance. They will make it easier for small business to survive, to grow and to employ. Fourthly, policies of fiscal consolidation will pave the way for sustainable growth, not the illusory growth based on deficit, on big budget spending that squeezes out private investment. It will be growth based on lower interest rates and higher private sector investment that will create jobs that you people destroyed. The opposition's approach on this is like it is on many other issues: a case of policy gymnastics, but this is a backflip that even puts Labor's previous efforts to shame. This is not just a backflip but a triple backward somersault. Firstly they opposed the scheme, then they said they would amend it and now they say they have had one anyway. Members on the other side should make up their minds of what they really think. No-one is pretending that on its own this policy will solve the problem but, in conjunction with other policies which provide the way for small business to grow, which extend real training and increase job readiness, which remove the structural barriers to employment the other side put in place, which will foster sustainable economic growth and job creation, this policy will help. This policy deserves the support of all who are serious about tackling the chronic problem of unemployment, from which we have suffered for far too long under the previous government.

34,Mr BEAZLEY,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"When your motives are evil, you have to cloud your initiatives with deceit. When your motives are evil, you have to cloud your argument with deceit. We have just heard-and this is the last thing I will say about him-from one of the minor spear carriers of the government, the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett), as he exits this place. He is playing a small role in blowing out that smokescreen, that cloud of deceit, which has accompanied this particular proposition. I said the motive was evil. I do not necessafor rily go to the proposition itself and describe it so, I describe the motive, as opposed to the proposition, as evil. We are going to do one or two things about that proposition when this hits the Senate and it will make it a very different proposition. The motive was evil. The motive was forefront twofold. Firstly, in the short term it was conceal a problem that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had developed in relation to inability to tell the truth to Ray Martin, was a lot more difficult than telling the truth or otherwise in this parliament. Mr Abbott-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order, which relates to standing order 75. The Leader of the Opposition has attributed evil motivation and the inability tell the truth to the Prime Minister. highly offensive and it should be withdrawn. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. papers Crosio)-There is no point of order.",84
35,Mr BEAZLEY,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I was talking about one don't of the minor spear carriers. We have one of the Savannah Rollers whose task it is here have their own particular version about the way in which they deal with propaganda. Let me go back to the subject of evil in the some view motivation associated with this because I not going to get off this point. We in politics need to restrain ourselves somewhat. When governments are in a situation where they not restrain themselves in their treatment of sections of the Australian polity, they have to have that fact drawn to the public's attention. The first motive was to conceal a problem which he had created entirely himself because of his maladministration. That is one thing. So he has dragged the kids of this country to shelter him, to provide him with a political shield in his own individual difficulty, but has a wider one than that-that is, the poll driven nature of this government. The Prime Minister made great play on couple of interviews that he once conducted that he saw himself as the most admirable political figure that he wanted to emulate in them. his life, Edmund Burke. It is not a dishonourable ambition of the Prime Minister to be like Edmund Burke, not a dishonourable ambition on his part at all. With this particular proposipolitics tion, and since he has been in office, he has shifted himself as far from Edmund Burke as he has ever been in his life. It is a memory cast back to the 1980s when he liked to think of himself as standing at the of the Liberal Party, at the forefront to of conservative opinion, out there leading public opinion. He liked to think of himself his as a man who thought through the issues which carefully and came to conclusions which may be different from the conclusions that were out there in the public and that he would seek to engage the Australian public in a dialogue about the needs of the nation about which he had a contribution to make. He was there to lead public opinion, like his mentor, his idol to or his role model, whichever way you want to This is describe Edmund Burke. Edmund Burke was the man who rattled his in front of his constituents and said, 'If you don't like what I stand for, don't elect me. If you don't like what my views are, elect me, but when I get into that place, when I get into the House of Commons, the to people will hear an argument from an informed opinion, the people will see a person representing you who actually tries to take of the national interest and to ride am that view' - these are not the ways he would have put it in those days, but this is what he meant-'to its conclusion.' That was Burke. do That was the Prime Minister's mentor. If Burke had that hotline from here to his grave, he would be spinning in it when he saw a proposition like this. What the Prime Minister has done with this is take a poll, and the poll says we do not like paying taxes for people who are unemployed. The poll says in that, despite the fact there are more than 800,000 people unemployed and rising under he this benighted government-there are 160,000 jobs or thereabouts being created a year and there are 160,000 joining the work force a every year-and despite the obvious mathematics, there is a cool tactic available here: attach blame to the unemployed and victimise If they were not kids, you could almost forgive him. If they were not kids, you could say it is part of the argy-bargy of normal in this country. If they were not the people that we as fathers and mothers in this place are supposed to protect, you could almost forgive him. But what he does is take an understandable community attitude out there-the community hates having to payout taxes because as they payout taxes they deprive themselves of resources to deal with their own children-a reasonable attitude on their part out there against wasteful public expenditure, and say, 'I will manipulate that attitude and tum you on the people in your society who are your future. I will tum you on them.' That is why I say-and I do not say it in the policy at all; I go to the tion here-that motivation is evil. Mr Abbott-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under standing order 76, there can be no imputation of improper motives to members. The Leader of the Opposition has deliberately imputed a highly improper motive to the government and to the Prime Minister. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I do not believe it is any different from the spurious point of order that the parliamentary secretary brought on before. There is no point of order understanding order 77.",85
36,Mr BEAZLEY,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I am going to go now to more evidence for these things, more evidence for the proposition that I have put forward. The evidence was provided so superbly yesterday by those who are held responsible by the government for implementing this scheme of theirs and the attitudes that they express to it. This scheme is supposed to have been well thought out and motivated by something other than what I have had to say so far. The Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Australian Youth Action Coalition, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, the Salvation Army, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Adelaide City Mission, the Australian Volunteer Association, the Sydney City Mission and Open Family were all invited to judge the particular proposition that had been put before them. What did this well thought out proposition, presented to them by a government motivated by the utmost sincerity, contain? It contained two press releases and a transcript. These organisations, the most serious social welfare organisations in this country collectively, the people who actually have a mind and a heart and who are used to dealing with some of the most critical problems in this nation affecting some of our least well-off citizens, were all gathered before the government to hear the pearls of wisdom and to receive two press releases and a transcript. Don't think they can't read motives like that. Don't think they might not know a thing or two about what was going on when they were motiva- subject to such shabby treatment. They were invited to take upon themselves the moral burden of this proposition-and it is no small moral burden. They are the ones invited to take people in a situation who are potentially-I do not think it will amount to this at the end of the day-forced into using their services. They take that moral culpability, and there is probably no small legal risk associated-which is something which is not thought out in this legislation at all-with those actually involved in it, and they are supposed to applaud these motives. No wonder they went for the doctor. No wonder they made revelations that, as far as they were concerned, they had been handed a pathetic excuse of a policy with which they could do very little and about which they were quite fearful. They have their responsibilities. They know they have to cooperate with government in these things, but they were handed this. What they will all ask is, 'Government, why don't you make this work and put in place those schemes which you knocked over? Why don't you put in place the propositions that the previous government had that were serious work for the dole schemes' - if you want to look at it in that insulting way-'that actually did work?' Because they actually worked and because they stand in such striking contrast to this proposition, that cloud of deceit which is necessary to surround this proposal has to be clouded with more deceit on these figures. Let me go through those particular success rates. The new work opportunities scheme was a new thing-the one most often cited, the one which they say was $143,000 per job but which was, in fact, only $10,000 per job. A mere differential of, say, one-fourteenth the propositions. That was a claimed success rate of four per cent-it was 21 per cent. We are talking about the long-term unemployed who do not get into the work force at all. It is not the difference between 21 per cent and 100 per cent; it is the difference between and nought. Then there was the claimed 28 per cent success rate for jobstart-the job placement program for people in un subsidised jobs carrying on after the time of their jobstart application. It was 50 per cent, not 28 per cent. The claimed success rate for job clubs was 12 per cent-in fact, the actual rate is per cent. This government wants to put this in place when the schemes that it is running now are failing so massively-despite the rise in the rate of unemployment-in providing opportunities for people to come into the work force. We have had the DEETYA national performance report leaked: in January 1997, only one of nine of key job targets matched performance in January 1996; subsidised job placement programs in January 1997 were around one-half of that in October 1996. Remember unemployment is rising. These positions are easier to fill when unemployment is rising. You occasionally have difficulty with it when unemployment is fallingthank God. But they actually have a difficulty with it when unemployment is rising! That is a real achievement in bureaucratic bungling by a minister. Placement activity for case managed job seekers dropped by an amazing 119 per cent compared with January 1996 levels. CES vacancies are now nine per cent below estimates and 20 per cent less then January 1996. Long-term unemployment placements are in significant decline. Youth unemployment placements against government targetsremember youth unemployment is also rising-are: Tasmania, 20 per cent behind; northern Australia, 30 per cent behind; WA, nearly 20 per cent behind; and western New South Wales, 10 per cent behind. This is a manifestation of a demoralised department led by two utterly incompetent and ill-motivated ministers. These are the in people who are supposed to work this scheme. The person who is supposed to work this scheme takes the most significant welfare organisations in this country and hands them two press releases and a transcript as a result. He then presents himself as person who 21 knows what he is doing, when he has a record of failure in implementing programs which they have pursued and persisted with. Remember these are against programs continuing-despite the slashes-under this government. They have made a judgment that they are actually able to fill them. They have made a judgment that they are capable of adminis36 tering this program. They have made a judgment that they will continue them to the extent they have in the post August 1996 budget-and they are failing miserably in their administration. We are supposed to think that this is going to be a success. It is not tailored to be a success. They set themselves very low bars. They have the hide to come into this place and say, 'Not everybody who went through your programs got a job.' But we say, 'How many are going to get a job out of yours,' and the answer is, 'No-one.' If they are not actually going to get a job and if they are not going to get training, what are they undergoing? What they are undergoing is social punishment. This is a chain gang. It is not an operation to get people into the work force and achieving something. It is important that people work; it is important particularly after you have been out of work for 12 to 18 months that governments do something about it, that you do not just simply receive benefits. You get yourself into a situation, if that is what occurs, where you are demoralised for life and so are your kids. This is not a trifling issue; this is a totally significant issue. It is wrong to have people in a situation where they are in unemployment forever. It is wrong to have people in a situation where they become dependent upon handouts from society. What people need is a hand up. Where is the hand up in this? We have made suggestions such as, 'Let's put a bit of training into it.' After all, you are going to pay them a training wage, a wage that was set by an award which included a proposition that 20 per cent of the time would be spent on training. To try to claim you are paying award rates when there is no training is in breach the award. This is automatically in breach of the award as a result. Mr Crean-Dishonest.",86
37,Mr BEAZLEY,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It is being absolutely dishonest with the Australian people. Why not give them training? Why is it so evil to train people who are unemployed? What is the problem with that? Why can't you do that? What is the problem with giving them decent guaranteed work of a nature that is going to be of some sort of value to the community and in which they are going to advance their skills? What is wrong with that? These are the sorts of propositions that we are putting in place on this. What is wrong with setting yourself a target? What is wrong with saying to the organisations that do this, 'What we want you to do at the end of thisand we want you to commit yourselves to a few targets-is to ensure that you have trained these people, that you have given these people an opportunity that leads on to some real work. What is wrong with that? Why is that so bad? Why can't you do that? But, no, that is claiming more for this scheme because this scheme is not about the needs of the unemployed; it is about social punishment-and it is poll driven. But there are a few traps in this scheme and they lie in the position that the Prime Minister puts forward. He knows darned well that 10,000 positions take you nowhere. Where they take you is this: it means for the kids who live in Wagga, Penrith or in some of the most depressed regional areas of this country, where kids in particular are producing all the signs of major distress and pressure-I will not go through the most horrible signs of them, but we all know what I am talking about-you are going to add another one. If they want to get benefits they will get no training, they will get no decent employment opportunities; they will get social punishment. But if you happen to be taking unemployment benefits in Lane Cove you can rock on as you please. That is really cool. 'Off you and do what you want but we will get you when you get to Wagga. Don't you worry about us, when you get to Wagga we will get you.' What do you say to the people who of decide to leave Wagga and come to the city and continue to receive unemployment benefits? Do you drive them out of their homes? Is that what the intention is? You drive them out of their relationship with their parents in order to be able to get some sort of succour in their hour of need? There is none of that in this. There is no thinking behind this as there is no heart. There is no common sense behind this as there is no heart. But do not think for one minute that we are not going to put in place a few things to make this work. You started with a proposition that we had in place and you have destroyed its core. You have manipulated it in terms of its title in order to benefit yourselves politically. But it was there; and it was working; and it gave hope. Right around the country people were picking up those positions and they were finding themselves in the work force. They were levered into the work force because we understand how small business really employs-not the theories you go on with. That you are theoretically driven is never more evident than when we look at your small business policies. We know that small business people take decisions about employment case by case. If they have somebody presented to them who is trained and skilled, or somebody presented to them with half an orientation to the work force, they will take a decision to employ whereas they may have taken the decision not to employ at all in circumstances where that did not exist. When you are levering people into the work force on a case by case basis with small business you need the Working Nation types of programs-and that is why they work. There is nothing in this that produces that, nothing at all. There is nothing in this that levers people into work. You ask us what we are going to do with this bill. We had a bit of a success in the Senate the other day; we are going to try for another one. We are going to try to get a bit go of heart back into this show. We are going to try to get this darned thing working. We are going to try to get a bit of training into are going to try to get a bit of protection for the people in it and we are going to try to get people into work because we think there is a requirement on government to provide things for the long-term unemployed and we think there is a requirement upon government to keep them related to the work force. So we are going to do our best to take your evil motives and purify them, and make this show work. (Time expired)",88
38,Ms WORTH,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The  he spoke, showed just how out of touch he is. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has come in here and has compounded the problem. They were thrown out just over a year ago because they were out of touch and because people had lost faith in them. They are proving it again today; they are absolutely out of touch. The Leader of the Opposition had the temerity to use words like 'blame', 'failure', 'evil' and 'common sense' - all out of context. Is community work evil or is it good? I would say to you it is good. Young people these days have a sayingand I bet some of you have heard it-'Get a life!' This is an opportunity to give some of them a chance to get a life, as they say, while unfortunately they are unemployed. For Labor, after 13 years, to now attempt to take the high moral ground is absolute hypocrisy. In the state I come from, with the double whammy effect of Labor federally and Labor at a state level, every individual in that state is now up for what has been the disaster and failure of Labor at a state level-with the Beazley black hole on top of that. But even if we leave out the Beazley black hole, we are paying $83,000 every hour of every day of every week of the year in interest alone on the debt that has been run up there. What type of environment is that? What type of incentive is there for business to get on and do things there and be able to employ people without a whole lot of effort and help going into it? Today there are thousands of good Australians out of work through no fault of their own. There is a huge pool of youth and talent that is being wasted. Tragically whole comit; we munities are feeling the negative social consequences of long-term unemployment. We all know that; it is not just felt on one side of this House. Unemployment is Australia's No.1 priority as we confront the next millennium. We should not and indeed cannot afford to resign ourselves to structural unemployment somewhere between eight and 10 per cent of the labour force. The unemployed are our fellow Australians, our neighbours and our children and it is up to all of us, including the unemployed, to work together for solutions. But we cannot delude ourselves that these problems can be accounted for with a wave of some magic wand-it takes time. Remember, Labor had 13 years to mess it up; we need some time to fix it. It will take time. Despite some good intentions, Labor's solutions failed and it is now up to the coalition to do its best. The one thing that remains the same is the magnitude of the issues involved. In some communities, including the inner suburbs of Adelaide, teenage unemployment is as high as 40 per cent with corresponding levels of homelessness. The ripple-like effects of unemployment touch us all. We can see those effects in our local communities and in the faces of those who have become disillusioned with the vast vanishing promises of a job for life and the great Australian dream of home ownership and a lifestyle that is the envy of the world. Recent public attention on the high rate of youth suicide in Australia has also highlighted the direct link with unemployment. It produces antisocial behaviour, drug and alcohol abuse and mental and physical decay. A recent article and study by the Australian Journal of Social Issues concluded that the long-term unemployed could be characterised by: ... heavy smoking, reduced participation in sport and increased drug usage. Females were drinking more and visiting the doctor more. Males were changing their drinking, friendship, eating and sleeping habits in directions indicative of loss of social contact. The government is to be commended for the initiatives it has already put in place aimed at addressing youth and long-term unemployment. The Howard government has already reformed industrial relations, small business, labour market and apprenticeship programs that will provide incentives for employers to hire additional staff and expand their enterprises. But even with low interest rates this will take time. It is not amusing-in fact, it is really quite disgusting-to see Labor members come into this place after 12 months of being in opposition and lecture us about high unemployment and what can be done about it. As if 13 years of inaction and patronising arrogance towards the unemployed-best summed up in Keating's 'Go get a job' jibe to a young person in Adelaide-can be undone in a matter of months. What nonsense. The government has a series of long-term strategies to produce long-term and real solutions. There is no other way. There are no short cuts or quick fixes. To suggest otherwise provides a false and dangerous hope to people in delicate situations and diverts attention away from the hard political decisions that must be taken to reverse labour market trends. It is insensitive, and yet another example of Labor's political opportunism. The question remains: if the solutions are long term, what do we do in the interim? We can continue to isolate the unemployed and shut them out from making any meaningful contribution to the community, patronising them with false hope and endless cycles of programs and watch from a safe distance as a whole generation becomes more removed, more prone to antisocial behaviour and more disillusioned with the dreams that our generation grew up with, or we can provide an environment where the unemployed have avenues to remain a part of mainstream Australia and to remain an ingredient in the social chemistry that makes Australia the best f'lace in the world to live. The legislation before the House today provides meaningful work and life experience. It is not a real job. It is not claimed to be a real job. I say again: it provides meaningful work and life experience. It is part of getting a life, not in the sense that it will lead directly to a job every time-there are other complementary schemes for that, such as the apprenticeship opportunities and labour market training programs. It will be experience in the sense that it will provide an opportunity for the unemployed to once again identify themselves with those around them, to mix with people in similar circumstances, to create networks for support and advice, to work with older people and to have the opportunity to make contacts with people who can be mentors. The work for the dole scheme is designed to break the vicious cycle of inactivity, boredom and disenchantment. Before now, unemployed Australians have had to endure periods of undeserved social ostracism. They have at times been vilified as bludgers, as being an unnecessary burden on taxpayers and unwilling to contribute in any way to the society which supports them. In my experience, those stereotypes have been far from the truth. Visiting graduate programs for the unemployed in my electorate, I have found a willingness on their part to remain a part of society and to remain in touch with the mainstream of society. Most simply want to be given a fair go. I have heard stories from my son and his friends that, as they have got off a bus and walked home, having spent the day studying as full-time students, they have been referred to as being dole bludgers. We have to cut into that cycle and do something about it-and we do not need criticism from the other side. Wouldn't it be nice for the unemployed to think that everybody in this place cared about them equally and was going to actually do something about helping to give them a life? This scheme provides the unemployed with an opportunity to answer their critics. I have no doubt that the vast majority will do so. The focus will be on community based projects. Have you on the other side heard that? I said 'community based projects'. Is that evil? Is that bad? I suggest not. These projects will provide direct benefits for the local communities, including tourism, environment, restoration of buildings, community service and charity work. The number of hours the person would be required to work under the initiative has been standardised on the basis of the age of the person and having regard to the national training wage award rates. This is not charity, but a mutual recognition of obligation. As I have said, I believe the vast majority of the unemployed will meet this challenge, which is both fair and reasonable. If they are not given this chance, they will continue to struggle to maintain a sense of purpose and a sense of community. The unemployed, especially those who have been out of work for a long time, do not need to be patronised by people saying that reentering the work force will be easy or will happen overnight. The work for the dole scheme is, however, a start. It is not a ment but an opportunity for the unemployed to train and re-educate, to get back into the swing of things, to start putting back a semblance of routine social contact and order that is essential in all our lives. We are deprived if we do not have that. The young unemployed especially do not want to remain inactive. Many of them have given the government the thumbs up for providing opportunities to contribute something back to the community and to have a reason to get out of the depressing and monotonous environment that they sometimes find themselves in. They do not want their talents wasted. One young job seeker from Prospect, in my electorate, wrote to me in 1995 saying, 'I get more offers of benefits than I do for jobs. Are we trying to get a working nation here or a bunch of couch potatoes?' Safety nets for those unfortunate enough not to have jobs must be maintained, but an emphasis on training, active participation and interaction with the community is also important. The work for the dole scheme provides that interaction. Ultimately, however, this initiative is secondary in comparison with other efforts by the Howard government to provide real jobs and a revitalised macroeconomic climate. The coalition does believe in training for the unemployed but only if there is a real job opportunity at the end of the line. When we were in opposition, in that last 10 months before the election, so many people from the long-term unemployed statistical line-up went into programs for six months. They came off the unemployment records. It was a cynical manoeuvring of them. When they came out the other end, without a job, they were not classed as long-term unemployed again. Statistically, and cleverly, they had been used to come out, hopefully so close to the election that they were not going to be counted, or just after the election, as freshly unemployed again. That was what we saw from Labor. Our labour market strategies are more relevant to business needs and are in place, as is a revitalised apprenticeship program. There is also an emphasis on real job creation punishthrough small business expansion, lower interest rates and increased private sector confidence. Unemployment remains Australia's highest priority both in economic and human terms. Our performance, as with the economy, will be seriously restricted if we do not get the answers right. More importantly, our creditability as a nation of opportunity, as a people prepared to give everyone a fair go and as a community concerned with poverty, health and social isolation, will be seriously questioned. This is Australia's greatest postwar challenge and it is up to all Australians here in the parliament, in the cities and in the country areas, and the unemployed themselves, to be part of the solution. I commend this bill to the House. It is one more initiative of the government aimed at tackling long-term and youth unemployment, and they deserve a chance.",89
39,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I want to speak this afternoon on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill and in doing so to support the second reading amendment moved  Baldwin). I suggest that the bill before the House, as indicated by its own title, is in essence a mean-spirited bill: it has a mean-spirited name and is a bill authored by what I regard as a mean-spirited government. I must say, with respect to the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), that if she was so vitally concerned with the issue of jobs then she would not be in here discussing this afternoon half-baked ideas about work for the dole, she would be more appropriately in here making speeches about the importance to the state of South Australia of the automotive industry. She should be talking about the need to stand against the government's proposals to further reduce tariffs rather than sneaking around the corridors suggesting that she is opposed to the further reductions in tariffs, but when it comes to a question of standing up and being counted, running for cover. Much comment has been made in this House, and by a wide range of political commentators, that the driving force for this legislation was a man who has never been elected and who does not sit in this House. That person occupies an office not too far from here in the Liberal Party headquarters, in Robert Menzies House. His name is Andrew Robb, the general secretary of the Liberal Party. I suggest to you that Andrew Robb's fingers-and he is known around the House as 'Push Poll Fingers Andrew' - are all over this legislation. Andrew Robb should look again at the act and warn the government that this law has been put together far too hastily. The work for the dole bill will come back in time and haunt the government. I say that especially if government members do not accept the opposition amendments to make this legislation a comprehensive, complete program for the unemployed, providing real skills and training as well as the work disciplines and social skills needed to get a real job. I note that the minister in introducing the legislation referred to the fact that this legislation will not lead to any real jobs. This legislation, as we all know, is a desperate political act driven by a desire to force from the front pages the embarrassing headlines about a former senator, Bob Woods. Andrew Robb rang the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and told him to chuck this piece of legislation at the media so as to distract them from the Bob Woods affair. As the minister said in introducing the legislation, it is not about real jobs, it is a distraction, it is to take political pressure off the government and especially the Prime Minister. Andrew Robb told the Prime Minister that the market research showed the voters resented giving young people something for nothing-that was the message from the general secretary of the Liberal Party: something for nothing-so 'let's give the voters a real trick, a work for the dole scheme'. I wonder how long before Andrew Robb rings the Prime Minister up to warn him that the legislation as it currently stands will now be politically harmful. Just, for example, ask what middle aged unemployed now think about the work for the dole legislation. I refer in passing to Rehame, the major media monitoring company, which I know Mr Robb frequently relies on to monitor the pulse of so-called mainstream Australia. It has been reporting since last Friday that the community is slowly turning on the government over the work for the dole legislation. The general manager of Rehame, Mr Maher, has been noting that, ever since the Prime Minister and Dr Kemp, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, came clean last week and opened the work for the dole scheme to older workers, the talkback callers have started turning against the work for the dole legislation. The message is also getting through to the world of talkback radio that this is bad law, legislation made on the run, legislation ill thought out. It is no longer just the opposition who are questioning whether or not this legislation is of substance. It is not just a few Canberra based political commentators. It really in essence is the mob-you know the mob the Prime Minister likes to refer to in his more erratic, excitable moments, the people out there in mainstream Australia-who have got the message that this is a thoughtless bill. I also refer to the scant information that has been publicly available about the operation of the scheme since it was initially announced on the run. Then again I suppose we should not be surprised, because that is the nature of the government-not legislation of substance, but legislation based on push polling, on what they believe is attractive out there in the minds of mainstream Australia, or the mob, as the Prime Minister refers to them in his more excitable moments. On day one what do we have? When the media sought details from Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, they surprisingly received a mystified response. Some of us are not surprised because that seems to be the method of operation of the minister on a frequent basis. The minister, the person responsible for employment in Australia at a national level, knew nothing about the Prime Minister's announcement. Ever since the February announcement, Senator Vanstone has looked confused when asked about this bad piece of legislation. But, of course, Senator Vanstone ought not to be surprised, because she knows that behind her is a junior minister, one Dr Kemp, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, who has done a real job on her as the senior minister. He has done a real job with the Prime Minister to promote himself at the expense of his senior minister, Senator Vanstone, so as to ensure that he was seen in the public mind as taking responsibility for the headlines and the public carriage as a further opportunity to promote himself in his venture to assume the peak responsibility for employment and education in Australia, the job of senior minister sitting at the cabinet table in the cabinet room. That is why Senator Vanstone has continued to be kept in the dark by the Prime Minister and his assistant, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. But what of this confusion, this mixing of messages? I believe it is starting to have a negative impression in the minds of the general pUblic. Rehame has confirmed that last Friday; the general public is confused. More importantly, it is slowly filtering through to the general public that there is something wrong, something suss, about this work for the dole legislation. Talkback radio listeners are beginning to say that the legislaold tion is suss. They know that it was announced because of the lack of information that is out there for public discussion at the moment and because of the flip-flop changes by the Prime Minister and the minister responsible-flipflop on the government's part, flip-flop policy stances-with different government spokespersons telling different stories at different times to suit their political circumstances at a given point in time. It all started, I suggest to the House, with the Prime Minister telling Sunday morning TV-to try and get the news junkies off his back about the Woods affair-about the work for the dole scheme. He called it a pilot scheme then- '20 to 30 schemes for young people only,' he told the media. Go back and have a look at the reports of the time, announced on the run to take political pressure off the Prime Minister and the government. Then we went to IV2 days a week, he said. About 5,000 are to be involved in the scheme, the Prime Minister said. It will involve community groups and local businesses. Even the Premier of Victoria wants local businesses involved. But the Prime Minister now does not seem to want local businesses involved. After all, that might lead to real jobs and the Prime Minister is not concerned about real jobs. He is just looking as if he might be doing something while he does nothing to reduce unemployment in Australia. Less than 40 days later, the pilot schemes have more than doubled. We are now up to 70, with $15 million on work for the dole. You know, for those who have got jobs or an education through Green Corps, there is $41 million. So much for concern for the unemployed; here is a government that is more concerned through Green Corps for the employed and for those in education. The majority of people who have taken up Green Corps jobs to date have been in education or employment. It is crocodile tears for the unemployed and a lack of investment in the needs of the unemployed by this government. They are now starting to come clean, I am pleased to report, and the honest position is coming out, not just for young people, but the who will also be asked to take part. Some people on work for the dole could be working 2V2 days per week or three days per week. The numbers have even doubled to 10,000. Local businesses have been essentially cut out of the schemes. In those 40 days we have seen some amazing antics by the Prime Minister and the minister responsible. The truth of the matter has also been revealed about the way they behaved in the campaign prior to the election in March of last year. The Prime Minister and Dr Kemp sought to hide the fact that before the March election they firmly denied that they would ever introduce a work for the dole scheme. So much for honesty in government. The Prime Minister huffed and puffed in this House in response to a question by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) on 10 February, when he said: · .. during the course of the election campaign I was asked on several occasions about the work for the dole and I said on those occasions that I objection to the concept of work for the dole. The Prime Minister was emphatic on February 10, and he continued: I at no stage ruled out introducing a work for the dole scheme. But the very next day the Prime Minster had to come clean. He waddled into the House still trying to pretend that he was a man of principle. He had forgotten about his ministerial code of conduct-that was long gone-but he was still a man of principle on this matter. And he sought, on indulgence from the Speaker, to explain away an embarrassing truth. During the election campaign, he reported, in answer to a question from the Herald Sun, Mr Howard was quoted as saying: · .. we do not support the introduction of a work for the dole scheme. Let me repeat: · .. we do not support the introduction of a work for the dole scheme. Mr Howard tried to explain away that mistake by saying that, though the answer was in his name, he was not prepared to take responsibility for it because it had been prepared by campaign headquarters. That has now become known as the Colston excuse. That seems to be Senator Colston's approach to life and accountability. The Prime Minister's approach to life is: it was not my fault; it was the fault of the general secretary of the party. The Colston excuse is: it was not my fault; it was my clerical assistant's fault. So, I suppose Senator Colston, who is so much a part of this government, has at least learnt something from the Prime Minister in the last couple of months. On the same day as the Prime Minister tried to slide out of responsibility for words published in his name, Dr Kemp was also caught out on the same matter. He had told the PM program that the Liberals had never ruled out work for the dole schemes. In August of 1995-and we know that he has got a short memory and likes to doctor figures from time to time-he claimed that the coalition had not considered the issue of work for the dole. In had no fact, Dr Kemp has been caught three times denying work for the dole schemes were on the agenda in the lead-up to the election. Dr Kemp, the junior minister who aspires to Senator Vanstone's senior ministry position, has enjoyed much of the limelight on the work for the dole scheme. But for Dr Kemp time is up; it is a question now of producing the goods. It is about time Dr Kemp faced the fact that when he sat down with a number of community groups to try and explain that the government believed that this was a scheme of substance, all he could produce at those discussions were three things as detailed in an article about those discussions, written by Mr Milne, in the Australian last Monday: This program is so much a key to their armoury of activities to reduce unemployment in Australia, and I would have thought that when, as a minister with responsibility, he sat down to consult community groups he would have been able to put some documentation of substance on the table. But what he put on the table about this dramatic opportunity for the unemployed all around Australia was a transcript of the Prime Minister's 9 February appearance on the Sunday program-and we all know that did not contain much substance-and then two media releases from the Prime Minister. If you compare that documentation, you will find that the position of the government varies from the initial announcement on 9 February on the Sunday program-this is so important an issue that you announce it on the run on the Sunday program!-to the two subsequent media releases. So what did well-respected community groups do, groups such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, the Adelaide City Mission, the Sydney City Mission, the Australian Youth and Policy Action Coalition? They came away from those so-called consultations underwhelmed, because they came away with the conclusion that it was not really a program of substance-and they are no longer alone. I refer now to the intervention by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett-that well known friend of the Treasurer (Mr Costello )-and he is really rather concerned about the issue of unemployment, as I am. He has had an opportunity, as has the Premier of Queensland, Mr Borbidge, to now consider this issue because there is not much substance to consider: just an announcement about work for the dole and now a bill before the parliament. There has been no real endeavour to provide training of substance or to suggest that the scheme means real jobs. But the Premier of Victoria really knows a dead cat when he sees it on the table, and I report to the House that the Victorian Premier does not think much of John Howard's work for the dole plan-he is on the record describing it basically as plain crazy and irrelevant. They are not the words of Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, but the words of a leading Liberal Party representative, the Victorian Premier, someone whom the coalition government likes to parade around at the moment as being an example of what it wants to achieve in government. Surprisingly, the Premier then went on to suggest that we make something of substance out of this badly thought out proposal by the Prime Minister. I think the Premier of Victoria is right. If you are going to do something about the unemployed do it right, invest in it and tum it into a scheme of substance. And that is why the Labor Party put forward a second reading amendment today and is saying that we ought to think about this legislation, amend it, tum it into something substance, so that we invest in opportunities for young people to ensure that they are given the skills and the discipline of work to get them back to work. It is about time that the government faced up to the fact that we have got a real problem on the unemployment front. Unemployment in Australia is getting worse. For example, look at the issue of long-term unemployment. We have hit a 17-month high figure of 242,700 people unemployed on a long-term basis in Australia. What is the government's answer? It is work for the dole, and the minister, when introducing the legislation, was forced to acknowledge that it will not lead to any real job opportunities for the long term unemployed. On the issue of the long-term unemployed, I also say that in one month from January to February, long-term unemployment in Australia jumped by an incredible 14,200. It is also interesting to note that it is worse in regional Australia. If you go to regions all around Australia-Ballarat, Bendigo, Lismore, Townsville, Cairns, Rockhampton or Perthyou will see the impact of a lack of willingness by this government to invest in regional Australia and to invest in decent labour market programs that create a second opportunity in life. That is what it is about. Those of us who are fortunate enough to have a job say that we believe there is a role for government in creating opportunities for the unemployed. Irrespective of whether people are young, middle aged or old, they all want to work, to have the opportunity in life to make a meaningful contribution to the welfare of Australian society. For that reason, I say on behalf of the Australian community, in a non-political way, that I think the Prime Minister sincerely wants to do something about the unemployed. He was caught out in a very desperate political situation on the Sunday program. For his own political reasons, he sought to take the heat off by announcing the work for the dole scheme on the run. Step back and think about it. We are 12 months into a three-year term of government and time is up for this government on the unemployment front. That is of what it is about: time is up. The Prime Minister said, 'Twelve months into this term of office, question me about the issue of unemployment.' Well, time is up! After 12 months, unemployment in Australia is worse. For that reason, the Prime Minister has to seriously consider, in a constructive way, the II-point plan put together by the Labor Party, which was aimed at trying to make the work for the dole scheme something of substance. We are willing to sit down with the government and talk about that II-point plan, because that plan contains nothing that any of us in this House ought to be ashamed of: providing training; making sure that workers are protected at work; and trying to ensure that whatever opportunities they pursue are related to job opportunities in the surrounding regions. I expect to see more and more MPs who represent regional Australia questioning this legislation, because they know it is not going to produce the goods. Time is up for the government. It should invest in decent labour market programs, not half-baked ideas put together for short-term political reasons. The unemployed expect better than the Howard government is offering. (Time expired)",91
40,Mr TRUSS,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) is quite wrong. As a member for regional Australia, I will not be opposing this legislation; I will be strongly supporting it. can assure the honourable member for Batman and any other members opposite that this proposal by the government is extraordinarily popular in the community. It is popular right across the spectrum. There are many young people who are anxious and eager to contribute something to the community for the unemployment benefits they are receiving. There are many parents anxious to see that their children have an opportunity to contribute to society. And, of course, there are those who work in health and welfare and other sectors who recognise the importance of providing meaningful employment to young people in their early days in the work force. For all of those reasons, this program is very popular in the community and, indeed, the only letters that I have received that are critical of the program have been from people who have asked, 'Why is it restricted only to youth? Why can't we have universal work for the dole throughout our country?, I hope that this pilot program-these 50 to 70 projects that will initially be introduced by the government-will indeed prove so successful that the government will be prepared to commit the additional resources required to extend this scheme much more extensively throughout the community. As the member for Wide Bay, I have a particular interest in the unemployment issue. I am sorry to say that, over the last decade or so, the Wide Bay-Burnett region has, more often than not, had the highest level of unemployment in Australia. I am not proud of that fact. In fact, it is a matter of considerable grief: the personal hardship that unemployment creates, the fact that there is so much wasted talent in my region and so many things that could be achieved if the employment opportunities were available. But I have to say in response to the member for Batman, who acknowledged in his speech that Australia has a real problem in relation to unemployment, and I also say to other members opposite: who created the problem? Who has been in government for the last 13 years? Who left us with the unemployment crisis that we have at the present time? Who has left this government with the job of picking up the pieces I from the mess that was created over the last decade? When Labor left office in March 1996 the unemployment rate in my electorate was 20 per cent. That is a pretty disgraceful tribute to the previous government's record: 13 years in government, 13 years of artificial job creation schemes and they delivered to the people of Wide Bay a 20 per cent unemployment rate. Is it any wonder that the people of my electorate and, indeed, people across Australia rejected those sorts of policies? They acknowledged that Labor could never do anything about bringing meaningful employment opportunities to regional Australia or, for that matter, across the nation. Whilst we have still got a long way to go, I am happy to report to the House that the unemployment rate in Wide Bay has progressively fallen since the change in government. We have had the double fortune in Queensland of having Labor governments thrown out not only at the federal level, but also at the state level, so we have been able to make some progress in reducing the unemployment levels in my region. The number of people in employment has improved by approximately 10,000 over the last 12 months. That is a pretty impressive performance. Whilst our unemployment rate is still amongst the highest in the country, some progress has been made and I welcome that achievement. Sadly, it has been amongst young people that the levels of unemployment have been the highest. My electorate and my region was mentioned in the House a couple of years ago as having an unemployment rate amongst youth of 50 per cent. It is a pretty disgusting state of affairs when one in two young people are walking around the streets, most of them anxious to have work but unable to find it. Again, that figure has improved over the last year or so, but we still have a long way to I say to the honourable member for Batman that not only was I not critical of this program, .I was quick to volunteer my area to participate in the youth work for the dole pilot schemes. I believe my electorate has all the credentials to make it an essential choice for at least one or more of the pilot programs. They are designed to test a range of options, including compulsory schemes, and will involve young people working for two days a week, or thereabouts, for their unemployment benefits. The work for the dole scheme will not, of course, solve the nation's unemployment problem. It is clearly a matter for the government to implement the sorts of policies which create the environment for business to invest and expand to create long-term productive jobs. But this sort of program does have the potential to address the feelings of hopelessness and lack of confidence that so many young people experience after not being able to find a job for an extended period. I know that there are some young people who take advantage of the welfare system to enjoy a lifestyle at the beach. That is perhaps one of the reasons why the sunbelt of southern Queensland has high levels of youth unemployment. But I believe that those people are in the minority. Most people are anxious to find productive employment, most are prepared to do almost anything to get a start in work and most have the support of their families in that regard. If a young person is passed over time and time again for someone else, it does not take all that long for that person to lose confidence in their capacity to ever get a job. One of the real benefits of this program is that it will give young people some hope for the future. High levels of youth unemployment have created a lost generation. One of the sadnesses of the unemployment problem in our country over recent decades is that we now have second generation long-term unemployed-young people leaving school who have never known a time when their parents were at work. They have no model, no work ethic and it is particularly difficult for these people to go. obtain a meaningful place in the work force. Eventually these people themselves become unemployable. Idleness leads to hopelessness and then vandalism and crime. A recent study by Dr Colin Mather has found that young unemployed men are 64 per cent more likely to report poor health than those in work and unemployed young women 82 per cent more likely to report poor health. There are clearly also strong links between the high levels of unemployment amongst youth and the high level of youth suicide in this country. When we deal with the issues of unemployment we are not just talking about finding employment, about achieving things in the community; we are also dealing very much with the social problems of young people in facing the problems of life. When young people feel that their life has no direction, they are particularly susceptible to poor health and, of course, eventually the ultimate response to hopelessness, youth suicide. As we look at providing programs that will offer opportunities for young people, there are enormous opportunities for the community to respond with worthwhile ideas. One of the side benefits of the youth work for the dole scheme will be to give young people an opportunity to contribute to their community and to complete worthwhile projects. There has been no shortage of volunteers in my own electorate putting forward ideas for the youth work for the dole scheme. These projects include building youth centres-and I think such an idea is a particularly appropriate use for this program-large-scale tree planting, beautification schemes, programs for young people to assist in aged care and helping other needy people in the community, helping service clubs. Local business groups have also expressed an interest in being involved in partnerships with the government to progress this scheme. I think these sorts of programs should not be seen in the same context as the failed Working Nation programs. No-one is suggesting that this program is going to solve the unemployment crisis. Labor should have been honest about its Working Nation programs and not built up community expectations about what their billions of dollars were going to achieve. One of the real problems that the government has to overcome in promoting the work for the dole scheme is the view that it is just like the schemes of the former government, many of which, of course, had a particularly dismal record. There has been a recent review by the Department of Employment, Education and Training into the Working Nation program and it revealed how utterly unsuccessful that expenditure of billions of dollars had actually been in creating real jobs. In this particular study they looked at a number of the programs. By way of illustration, the survey of jobstart found that, after three months, 50 per cent of the jobstart participants were in a job compared with 22 per cent of comparison people who were not involved in the jobstart program. DEETY A assessed that as effectively a 28 per cent success rate. Twenty-eight per cent may not sound all that good for jobstart but when you look at the other programs their record was infinitely worse: job clubs produced a 12 per cent success rate; skillshare, seven per cent; jobtrain, seven per cent; jobskills, 11 per cent; and the new work opportunities-the classic of them all--only a four per cent success rate. You could argue that even those figures are unrealistically high. Whether or not these programs actually created new jobs or just resulted in a re-shuffle of one person onto the unemployment queue for another person into these jobs is of course open to conjecture. There would have been some natural jobs growth with the rise in population. How much can be attributed, as far as jobs growth is concerned, to the Working Nation program is very doubtful indeed. What these statistics reveal is that a program like the new work opportunities cost $143,000 for every job that was created-hardly an effective use of taxpayers' funds. Even a modestly successful program like jobstart has resulted in a cost of about $4,100 for each of the positions that have been created. It can hardly be said that the billions of dollars of Working Nation have yielded great benefits to our country. However, one benefit that it did provide, at great cost, was opportunities for long-term unemployed people to actually do something useful and to participate in a project which might have provided benefits to the community or to upgrade their own skills by being involved in a training program. Those sorts of activities are a far better use of someone' s time when unemployed than wandering the streets. When an employment opportunity comes along when the economy improves, at least the individual will have the skills that will enable them to better fit a new position. which might happen to become available. That element of the Working Nation program was of value, and that is the element that has been picked up in the government's work for the dole program. At much less cost, we will be delivering the same benefit to a particularly important group, young unemployed, the people who have most to lose from being out of work for a long period of time. Another issue that is raised repeatedly and one that is very difficult to address is the problem of the relativity between the wage levels for young people in the work force and those on unemployment benefits. There are some who argue that young people are not attracted to take up a place in the work force because youth unemployment benefits, the social welfare system, is unduly generous. I also come across families, particularly those in small businesses, where their children-the under-18-year-olds-are unable to access the welfare benefits that some of their mates down the street can access because of the assets and incomes tests on their parents. These are all issues that do need to be resolved, but they are not resolved simply. It is not reasonable to reduce social security benefits and place an additional hardship on people who are out of work for long periods of time. On the other hand, to boost wages to much higher levels for young people in the work force will make them less attracti ve to employers and increase the problem of youth out of work. Addressing this issue of the relativity between wages available in the marketplace and the social security system is a particularly difficult one but must be an issue addressed by the government in the period ahead. The youth work for the dole been warmly welcomed in the community. This legislation puts in place the mechanisms to introduce the scheme. In a sense, the necessity to implement some of these amend will ments is a pretty sorry reflection on the attitudes of the past. For instance, to have change the act so that the requirement to work in return for the payment of allowances is a breach of the law indicates that it was strange law that we had that prevented from working when they were in receipt of benefits. The legislation also allows for the $10 week extra allowance to be paid to particiincluding pants in the program to help meet some those extra costs that are associated with going to work, the extra costs of travel and the extra costs of clothing that might needed. Of course, there are also other avenfor ues within the program to help provide some of these forms of assistance. The work for the dole scheme is a very worthwhile program but it is not of itself a solution to youth unemployment. What the government needs to do in that regard is much more significant and much more important for our economy as a whole. The government does not resile from its main approach to solving unemployment, namely, creating real jobs. The issue of youth unemployment is one of the government's foremost priorities. There are around 100,000 young people who are unemployed, including at least 30,000 who have been unemployed for six months or longer. The government's primary responsibility is to create a climate where small business can grow and provide real jobs, and we have been active. Interest rates have fallen substantially; we have provided a more flexible industrial relations environment; we have got rid of Labor's job destroying unfair dismissal laws; and we are reducing business red tape. The announcements this week will provide further significant incentives to small business to invest and employ. Real relief has been provided for capital gains tax, and reductions in the provisional tax uplift factor-and all of these sorts of things-provide additional income for business to encourage them to scheme has employ more people. Specifically in relation to youth unemployment, the government has introduced a new apprenticeship and traineeship scheme which give young people greater flexibility in terms of their mix of onand off-job training. to Last month, the government announced the jobs pathway program to help school Ie avers not move into permanent jobs. Last October, the a government announced the first school based people traineeships for students. The government has also secured agreement with the states and territories to expand per vocational training in secondary schools, school based apprenticeships. Last of September, the government announced new traineeships for young people in five key rural industries. A great deal has been achieved, be but much more needs to be done. The work the dole scheme gives young Australians the chance to give something to themselves and give something back to society, while they are waiting for long-term productive jobs.",96
41,Mrs CROSIO,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) calls them the 'battlers'. They are the lower and middle income earners, in my case. They are from western Sydney. They are from ethnic backgrounds, from families old and young; they are single people, students, elderly couples, single pensioners: the list goes on and on. They are diverse and dissimilar, and often the only factor-apart from geography-which draws them all together is the fact that most of them are finding it more difficult than ever these days to make ends meet, to find jobs, to educate their kids and to simply make it through the week without going over their shoestring budgets. These are the so-called battlers whom the Prime Minister loves to name-check: they have become his mantra. And, as with any mantra, repeating the same word over and over again has started to sound increasingly empty and meaningless. The Prime Minister talks about the battlers as if they were a medal, a trophy to be worn around his neck. The reality is that the Prime Minister does not know the battlers in Sydney's west any more than those members of his government who supposedly represent them. If the Prime Minister knew the people of western Sydney, he would know that their greatest hope is for their fathers, mothers, sons and daughters to be able to find employment-a fulfilling, full day's work for a full day's pay-despite living in a sea of unemployment. If the Prime Minister really harboured some affection for the people of western Sydney, the battlers whom he frequently talks about, he would have done something to turn that hope into a reality. His government would have at least made some inroad into the crippling unemployment rates of western Sydney. As it is, the Prime Minister's insincerity and the impotency of his government's policies have been exposed by the fact that not only has unemployment worsened in western Sydney over the last 12 months but it has done so entirely because of the political decisions of his government. This fact has now been exposed even further by the coalition's supposed jewel in the crown: its work for the dole scheme. Work for the dole highlights the real priorities of the Howard government, perhaps more so than any other piece of legislation introduced over this past year. It highlights for us all the Prime Minister's No. 1 priority is keeping his and his government's approval rating as high as possible in the opinion polls, rather than formulating and administering policies which actually contribute to the public's benefit. Work for the dole is nothing more than an expensive PR exercise, a demeaning title for a scheme which seeks to detract and divert attention from the real problems this government faces in creating jobs. The scheme's actual public benefit, when compared with the millions of dollars of labour market programs axed in the last budget, is marginal. No matter how much the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), postures in the House about how work for the dole is really about 'bringing young unemployed people back into the work culture to help rebuild a work ethic', its real value for the government is that, out there in voter land, it is read as the 'belt the dole bludgers' scheme. It is seen as the 'put a little bit of backbone into those lazy young layabouts' scheme. According to the member for Goldstein, and the Prime Minister, there are no votes in creating real employment through intelligent and successful labour market strategies. That is too hard for them. As far as they are concerned, they want to be seen by mainstream Australia as initiating a scheme which makes it tougher on dole bludgers-this, while admitting quietly on the side, of course, that work for the dole is really not a solution to youth unemployment. If only the government chose to expend as much time and energy on creating jobs as it spends wading through the ranks of the unemployed with a baseball bat for the sake of public opinion, we might actually be getting somewhere. But, as I said, it is matter of priorities for this government. My priority, as the member for Prospect, is to see that my constituents get as good a deal as possible from their government. Work for the dole in its present form does not even come close to delivering that. The electorate of Prospect covers an area plagued with the second highest rate of that unemployment in Australia. The FairfieldLiverpool region's unemployment rate for February this year was 16.5 per cent. Only the region of the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), the previous speaker, is higher, at 17.2. The unemployment rate for 15to 19year-olds in the Fairfield-Liverpool area has skyrocketed in the past year to 38 per cent. These figures have risen in past 12 months, they have not gone down. They have not gone down despite the fact that Australia in March 1996, when this government first came to office, was experiencing strong growth, low inflation and increasing levels of consumer and business confidence, levels which at the very least were much higher than they are at present. How could this be? How did these unemployment figures go up? At the same time, the Prime Minister was surprising everybody by finding Penrith on the map and congratulating the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) on her by-election win, he was putting his signature to policies which meant that the long-term unemployed of western Sydney found it even harder to find work, by cutting places in labour market programs to train them. At the same time as he was launching his much vaunted family tax initiative in Wentworthville, in Sydney's west, the small business people of our area were having their confidence sapped by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to such an extent that not only were they not hiring anybody, but they were laying people off left, right and centre. Small business people are continually stopping me in the street and telling me that business is worse than ever. When I ask them about their prospects for hiring new staff in the future they raise an eyebrow, look at me and say, 'You have got to be kidding.' A year into this government's first term in office, the unemployment figures in the Fairfield-Liverpool area are a damning indictment of the Prime Minister's supposed concerns for his battlers and his administration's ability to create jobs-38 per cent youth unemployment, and it is becoming worse over the year, not better. The Prime Minister is the man who said: Youth unemployment is still the biggest social problem this country has. It's a product of failed economic policies. With youth unemployment rising during the first year of this administration, are we to conclude that the Prime Minister's economic policies have failed? This is the man who said: If you can't provide jobs for young people, you don't have a right to claim to continue to govern this country. Are we then to expect a resignation any day now from the Prime Minister? This is the man who said, in reply to a question as to what he would like to see most changed in Australia: I think giving young people jobs, I think that's the biggest thing I'd like to change ... I would put that ahead of just about everything else. Surely you would imagine that, in the 12 months when we have now seen such other pieces of coalition legislation go through this parliament as the Workplace Relations Bill and the Telstra Privatisation Bill, the Prime Minister would have been able to concentrate and orchestrate some decline in youth unemployment-just a small dent, perhaps-especially when he said that doing so was one of the biggest things, 'ahead of just about everything else' his government would attempt. He has not. As I said, the spiralling unemployment figures are a damning indictment of his government's effectiveness. They are a damning indictment of the lip service-and I am glad you are here, Prime Minister, to hear it-that the Prime Minister pays to constituents in my electorate and electorates like mine across Australia. Work for the dole is now just the icing on the cake. Let us look at the government's record on jobs. When the Howard government came to power in March 1996, the total number of young unemployed people across Australiathose aged between 15 and 19-was 166,300, at a rate of 21.9 per cent. In February 1997 there were 184,900 young unemployed people, a rate of 23.8 per cent. When the Howard government came to power in March 1996, the total number of unemployed people of all ages across Australia was a seasonally adjusted figure of 770,800, at an unemployment rate of 8.5 per cent. Close to 12 months later, the Howard government has orchestrated a further 40,000 people onto the dole queues, with 810,800 people unemployed at a rate now of 8.8 per cent. In February alone, some 24,600 full-time jobs disappeared. The labour system is haemorrhaging people onto the dole queues at a rate of knots unimaginable 12 months ago. In western Sydney an employment rate of 12.9 per cent in February 1996 has now jumped a full percentage point to 13.9. Labor, in its first year of office, taking the reins of government while the country still reeled under the worse recession since the 1929-33 Depression, was able to increase employment by 2.1 per cent. The coalition, on the other hand, taking over an economy growing at a substantial rate, inheriting an economy better than the curate's egg, as the Prime Minister quoted, when the overall economic indicators were positive, only managed to increase employment by a significantly less 1.5 per cent.",99

43,Mr HOWARD,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I would like to convey in this parliament the warm congratulations of the government and, I am sure, all of the Australian people to Geoffrey Rush for his Oscar for Best Actor for Shine and also to John Seale for his award for cinematography in The English Patient. Both awards are a magnificent tribute and are testimony to Australia's thriving film industry. I know I speak on behalf of all Australians in conveying our warm good wishes to both of them. It is a remarkable achievement. This is the first Oscar since 1976 for an Australian actor. I would point out that the Film Finance Corporation was a major investor in Shine, investing some $3.5 million. On an occasion like this it is worth remarking upon the contribution of people from both sides of politics who have supported the Australian film industry over the years, stretching back to the contribution of John Gorton. I know that the member for Lalor has had an interest in the film industry over a very long period of time. But our congratulations are to Geoffrey Rush and John Seale for magnificent performances. They have brought a great deal of pride, credit and honour to the entire Australian community. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",102
44,Mr BEAZLEY,AYES SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I would also ask for the same indulgence, Mr Speaker. I scarcely noticed the events of yesterday in the midst of my deep and genuine grieving over the result of the Sheffield Shield cricket final. I congratulate the Queenslanders on a substantial outcome. Western Australia suffered greatly and, some might say, unjustifiably given their results during the year. I join the Prime Minister in his comments. It is a matter of, I think, very great pride for us as a nation that our expertise in film is now universally recognised and that a genuine Australian story has been recognised across the globe as well. So often it is the case that what is produced by urban Australia is set aside as being something not worthy of genuine international interest. This was a situation in which a very substantial Australian story was told internationally-and told tremendously well. It was acted brilliantly and produced brilliantly and it is a source of very great pride to us that that should be so. The technical expertise that we now have in cinematography, so well symbolised by John Seale's achievement at the Oscars, is a great thing too. For many of the young people now in our film and television schools, who are entering a life which is often fraught with difficulty and pitfalls as well as opportunities, these are truly great examples that have been set for them. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Papua New Guinea",102
45,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is it not a fact that Sir Julius Chan's mercenary project was the subject of active negotiation and planning as early as September last year? Is it not the case that at least five months elapsed before the Australian government was properly briefed on the scheme and that this briefing took place only when the mercenaries were arriving in PNG? Would not earlier warning have allowed the Australian government to register our nation's opposition before the Sandline deal was signed and the consequent destabilisation of PNG under way? Would you acknowledge that these circumstances constitute a diplomatic and intelligence failure of the very highest order? Will the government now commit itself to a full and independent inquiry into the reasons for this failure and take all necessary steps to ensure that it will never happen again?,102
46,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the first place, no, of course we will not be having such an inquiry. It was the practice of the previous Australian government and its predecessor and, no doubt, all of its predecessors before that, and it is still the practice of this government, that we do not comment on intelligence matters. We never will and we will not comment on them in this matter. The Australian government had frequent contact with the Papua New Guinea government during last year, including the latter part of last year. I think I am right, memory, in saying that in October we held a ministerial forum with the Papua New Guinea government. I chaired the Australian side of that forum and the Deputy Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Chris Haiveta, chaired the Papua New Guinean side of that forum. At that forum meeting, we made it perfectly clear that we regarded the only solution to the Bougainville problem as being a peaceful solution. We have constantly told the Papua New Guinea government during the course of the last 12 months that we see no military solution to the Bougainville problem. Without going into the details, because agreement was reached between us and the Papua New Guinea government during last year that we would not, there was a ministerial meeting held with the Papua New Guinea government subsequent to the Adelaide forum and this very same view was extensively canvassed and put at that meeting. Finally, in relation to the Sandline contract, as I understand it, every effort was made by those involved in the contract to keep that contract absolutely secret. That has been perfectly clear. I now know-and I have not known for very long-that that contract was signed on 31 January. What I can say is that I have known that there were those in the Papua New Guinea government who believed there was a military solution and there were those who did not believe that. Last year, an operation called Operation High Speed II, which was a Papua New Guinea Defence Force operation, was mounted on Bougainville. It was extremely unsuccessful. Even after that, there were still those who believed that there was a possible military solution to the problems of Bougainville. I have told the House at some length that we, as a government, have continually argued that there is no military solution to the problem of Bougainville. We have continually argued that. Naturally, I am not going to go into any intelligence matters publicly. China",103
47,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact, Prime Minister, that you have decided to invite a high powered Australian business delegation to accomfrom pany you on your visit to China this week? What are the benefits to Australians generally of this direct contact between our business leaders and Chinese decision makers? What does the Prime Minister hope to achieve from his talks in China and from his discussions in Singapore tomorrow?",103
48,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The business delegation that will accompany me on my visit to China is some 20 strong. It is probably the most senior and most broadly representative business group to accompany an Australian Prime Minister on an overseas visit. The fact that so many people at such a senior level were so keen to participate in the delegation is evidence of the strong commitment of the business men and women of Australia to commercial links between Australia and China and to a deepening involvement by Australians in the economic growth which is so evidently taking place in China. It is also worth mentioning that the peopleto-people links between Australia and Singapore and Australia and China are very deep. Some 11,000 Singaporeans are studying here, and Singaporean tourists and investors have also received an exceptionally warm welcome in this country. In the order of 300,000 Australians or permanent residents of this country are of Chinese descent and, therefore, the cultural impact of people of Chinese descent and Chinese background on Australia, particularly in the major cities, is significant. As the member will know, the links between people of Chinese descent and Australia go back well into the 19th century, although in numbers they have grown considerably in recent years. Australia's relationship with China is an exceptionally important one. During the time. I spend in China, I will be approaching that relationship on the only proper basis, and that is one of mutual respect. China is a very different society from Australia's. We will be asserting and defending the values and the attitudes of Australia. Equally, I am not going-as no Australian Prime Minister should ever go to China-in a hectoring, lecturing or moralising mode, but rather as the leader of an independent country that makes its own decisions about its own best interests and its alliances, according to own assessment of Australian interests and of the interests of no other country. Singapore is a very close partner of Australia. It is the country in the ASEAN grouping with which Australia has the largest volume of trade. We are associated with Singapore through the five-power defence arrangement. I look forward very much to my discussions with the Prime Minister of Singapore, and also with President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng in China. The links between Australia and those two countries are important. It has been something of a bipartisan given of Australia foreign policy for a long time to build relations with China and, in different ways, a number of my predecessors-beginning with Mr Whitlam, and certainly embracing Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke in particular-placed a lot of emphasis in their own ways on the relationship with China. We seek a constructive partnership with China. My purpose is to build on what is already a good relationship and to advance the personal association that I established with President Jiang Zemin in Manila. I remind the House-and I dare say it does not need reminding-that China will become, by some estimates, our third largest trading partner by the year 2000. It is a nation of 1.2 billion people which has experienced phenomenal economic growth and change over the last few years. I will have the opportunity of observing that, as well as having ministerial talks at the appropriate level in both Shanghai and Beijing. I welcome the fact that so many eminent men and women in business in Australia will be accompanying me. I congratulate those men and women on the contribution that they are making at a commercial level in building this very important relationship between our two countries. Native Title: National Farmers Federation",103
49,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister take action now to make up for his failure of leadership last year on racial issues by conits demning the National Farmers Federation for its insensitive and inflammatory television advertisement showing a black child competing with a white child for supremacy on the native title issue? Will you ask that that advertisement be withdrawn?,104

73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,105
74,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was beginning to tell the member for Banks, this is an issue which has generated enormous indignation in the Australian community. The truth of the matter is that it is not an issue that involves the exchange of simplistic slogans from either side. If you were totally objective about it, you would have noted that there have been many inflammatory things said over the past few months-including of me, of members of the government and of members of the pastoral industry-about our attitude towards the indigenous community of Australia. I think it is fair to say that there have been many inaccurate remarks passed about myself, the Deputy Prime Minister and other senior members of the government about our attitude towards the indigenous people of Australia and we have chosen, quite frankly, to allow many of those remarks to go over our shoulders. We have done so in the interests of trying to achieve a longer term solution to this problem. It is a very difficult problem. I have been endeavouring for the past three or four months to find an outcome which is fair and just to all interested parties. To that end, I have convened a number of meetings, including a meeting which was attended at the Lodge on Sunday night by representatives of the Aboriginal people, as well as the President of the National Farmers Federation. There are many things said about this in the heat of the discussion and there have been a lot of things said by some of the representatives of the indigenous people that are just as strong, just as critical and, in the eyes of the farmers, just as unfair. The idea that there is a monopoly of restraint in language on one or other side is completely fallacious. I do not think your question has contributed anything towards a rational outcome. I understand the strength of feeling of Australia's farmers. Australia's farmers were told by the former Labor Prime Minister of this country that the grant of a pastoral lease extinguished native title. That was their understanding. They are now told by the High Court of Australia that it does not, and I can understand why they feel angry about that. They are entitled to feel angry about being misled by Paul Keating. I have said to them, and I will say to the Aboriginal community of Australia and to the miners of Australia, that we will not get a solution to this problem unless everybody is prepared to give a bit of ground. You will not get a solution otherwise. I do not really think you will get a solution by taking cheap debating points, which is all your question represents. Palliative Care",105
75,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware, following the passage of the Andrews apply to Burma? anti-euthanasia bill, of claims that the Commonwealth is not committed to maintaining funding for palliative care? Do such claims have any validity?",106
76,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of those claims. The situation is that the Commondenied wealth part of the palliative care program is San Suu Kyi. due to run out on 30 June this year. I want to inform the House that not only will that program be maintained, that is, renewed after 30 June 1997, but, given the particular cumstances of this issue, in the light of passage of the legislation sponsored by the member for Menzies, I can inform the House that the amount of money to be contributed by the Commonwealth towards that palliative care program will be equivalent in real terms to the amount that was contributed in 1995-96 and will, therefore, represent an increase what was contributed last year.

78,Mr BARRY JONES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. How does the government assess the current situation in Burma with violent Buddhist-Muslim clashes in Mandalay, disturbing evidence of serious public health failures in rural areas, increasing military presence in the streets of Rangoon and increased and arbitrary restrictions on freedom of access to and communication with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, something I can confirm personally? Does this demonstrate an increasing rigidity and insecurity on the part of the SLORC regime, marked by a total refusal to negotiate with Aung San Suu Kyi? How does the government now assess prospects for democracy in Burma? If and when Burma enters ASEAN, will this be interpreted as a condemnation of the SLORC dictatorship? Finally, what additional pressure does the Australian government now propose to",106
79,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Lalor for his question. Can I begin by saying that I was both surprised and concerned that when the honourable member for Lalor was recently in Burma he was access to an appointment with Aung,106
80,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Shame!,106
81,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I agree with the right cirhonourable member who interjected-it was the a shame. The honourable member for Lalor is a distinguished member of this parliament and the president of one of the major political parties, albeit one of diminishing size and importance. I thought that it was an extraordinary decision by the authonties in Burma to deny the member for Lalor access to Aung over San Suu Kyi. I know that that honourable member and many others are deeply concerned about the situation in Burma and there is not any doubt that the SLORC, the State Law and Order Restoration Committee, is in firm control of the country and the repressive policies and its failure to undertake meaningful political and social reforms are creating deep discontent. Very briefly on the points that the honourable member raised, can I just say that while the SLORC persists in a tough approach the prospects for democracy in Burma are far from good. Not only has the SLORC ignored the results of a general election in 1990 which gave a large majority to the National League for Democracy but it is concentrating its efforts on fragmenting and undermining political parties in Burma, which were returned with significant electoral support. The honourable member asked about Burma's possible admission to ASEAN. Whilst I cannot inform the House of the exact timing of Burma's admission to ASEAN, there is a very real prospect that it will pen in the near future. It may not, but there is a real prospect that it will. Certainly ASEAN leaders have made clear that a decision on Burmese entry will be made independently of concerns about the political situation in Burma in line with ASEAN's principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of members. I do understand that some ASEAN member states are concerned about the situation in Burma and its effect on regional stability and they have made that clear to me personally on occasions. They have been conveying messages to the SLORC, the State Law and Order Restoration Committee, in Rangoon about the need for reform to the Burmese political process. I do not think that fact is well enough known and understood in Australia. Whether or not Burma is a member of ASEAN, Australia will continue to make known its concerns about the situation in Burma and we will do what we possibly can to encourage political change. We remain committed to working with like-minded countries in the international community and, of course, in the United Nations system to promote progress in political reform and to promote human rights in Burma. Economy",106
82,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the current trends in the Australian economy in light of recent economic indicators? In particular, what are the expectations for growth in the coming financial year and how will this effect the prospects of Australian families and businesses?",107
83,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the Australian business expectations for the June 1997 quarter compared with the March 1997 quarter. In nearly all respects, it showed that business expectations are for strengthening sales, strengthening profits of some 7.8 per cent and strengthening investment at a time when selling prices are quite restrained. That is consistent with recent indicators hap- showing a growth in business confidence and business expectations and a pick up in the Australian economy throughout the course of 1997. Overnight the US Federal Reserve announced that the federal funds rate would be lifted by 25 basis points to around 5.5 per cent in the United States. This was a preemptive strike against potential inflationary pressures and was widely anticipated and factored into both financial and stock markets. It should be noted that the consumer price index in the United States is running stronger than it is in Australia. In the period to February, the US core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose by 2.7 per cent. In Australia, the CPI to the December quarter was running at 2.1 per cent in underlying terms and 1.5 per cent in headline terms. The lift as a precautionary strike against potential inflationary pressures in the United States will contribute to a continuation of the low inflation growth cycle in the US which is consistent with Australian expectations of a continuing low inflation growth outlook. The inflation rate, which is the target of the government and the Reserve Bank by agreement, is set at two to three per cent. In underlying terms we are well within that band and that will be the key determinant of monetary policy in accordance with the arrangements set between the government and the bank. We see a continuing low inflation, low interest rate environment, strengthening business expectations, consistent with good growth in 1997, and real opportunities for small business and other businesses alike. Industry: Growth",107
84,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister would be aware that all those statistics that the Treasurer just enunciated add up to simply-at best-an achievement of growth levels that were predicted in the budget, which do not produce any substantial improvement in the employment situation. Has the Prime Minister seen the speech given by the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, on 25 March, in which he said: In the last year, we have seen some policy decisions made by the federal government which have been more damaging to industry than probably realised at the time of their announcement? Has he seen, for example, too, Jeff Kennett's further comment: The decision to reduce support for research and development and the increase in HECS fees for science and engineering courses have contributed to an impression that the Commonwealth government does not value R&D? Has he seen further the comments of Jeff Kennett that the scrapping of the development import finance facility took away a key diplomatic and industry development strategy? And has he seen further as well the following comments of Jeff Kennett: Similarly, the current consideration of future arrangements for the pharmaceutical industry is worrying, as I fear the industry's issues are being blurred with health policy issues? Will the Prime Minister now undertake to either get his industry minister to produce or to produce himself an industry policy that actually means something in terms of jobs and growth in this community?",108
85,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the question is no. I have not seen the speech. But it gives me an opportunity to make a couple of observations, and I will not let the opportunity go by without making just one or two very gentle observations. One of the things that I have observed over many years in Australian politics is what you might call zeal in the general but circumspection in the particular. It is a complaint that runs along the following lines: you keep telling the federal government that it has to cut the budget deficit and restore the fiscal position of the Commonwealth but, whenever it does anything to achieve that goal, you always say that that particular decision is wrong. I have observed premiers over the years do that. I will be completely bipartisan in spreading my comments and observations around. I seem to remember a bloke called Goss engaging in a little bit of that from time to time. I even think there was a Victorian Premier called Bolte who once did it, and another one called Askin, and another one from Western Australia called Court and another one from Queensland whose name has just escaped me, however momentarily! _Can I just say that I understand the dynamics of Commonwealth-state political relations. I have observed them over a very long period of time. And can I say that there is a remarkable constancy of response. That is: it is always a good idea to get your budget into balance, to cut your spending and to be fiscally responsible-as the present Treasurer of Australia is undoubtedly fiscally responsible, and I congratulate him for the priority that he gives to fiscal consolidation. But, having said all that, when it actually comes to the crunch, you always get a bit of a line if you attack the particular decision that has been taken. I count them all up. R&D was criticised. HECS was criticised. I know Radio Australia has been singled out for additional support. When you add it all up, you have not got much fiscal consolidation left. But, of course, I know what will happen: the next time one of these speeches is made, we will undoubtedly get a list of all the alternative areas where expenditure should be cut. Can I say to that premier-and indeed to any other premier who is minded to make a speech of that kind-I will be delighted to look at the alternative expenditure reduction list. Petroleum Prices",108
86,Mr LIEBERMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and Technology. With the Easter holidays about to commence and large numbers of families intending to travel over those holidays, much attention will be given to petrol prices. Will the minister give an update on progress being made to achieve access, accountability, transparency and competition in the fuel industry?",109
87,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Indi for his question. He is one of the principal influences on the government's major reforms of the petroleum industry-the most major for several decades. In that, he is joined by every regional and country member-the members for Mallee, Lyne, MCEwen, Bendigo and the list goes on. They are all involved, naturally. The government, as honourable members will recall, announced last December that it would remove the petroleum products from price surveillance in mid-1997, subject to procompetitive developments in the marketplace. Two of the preconditions included commitments from the oil majors to allow open terminal access and price transparency for the purchase of petrol by distributors and retailers. The government has received commitments from the major oil companies in regard to price transparency. Ampol has been publishing data on wholesale prices in city and country areas since June of last year. Now Shell has joined forces with the NRMA of New South Wales to provide a breakdown of price components, including retailer-distributor margins in Sydney and selected regional areas. I understand that Shell is likely to enter into similar arrangements with motorists' organisations in other states. It would be in the interests of the other oil companies to develop similar initiatives to Shell. All the major oil companies have provided the government with 'in principle' undertakings in regard to open access. The government has asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to negotiate with the oil majors on the finer details to develop a workable open access regime for oil terminals. Of course, Ampol has already made a promising start, with the release last November of their guide to open access terminals. I would urge other oil companies to develop similar regimes to that put forward by Ampol. With the Easter holidays fast approaching, there is some concern that some oil companies, distributors or retailers may use the period to jack up prices and will use it as an excuse, given that there is increased car travel and petrol consumption. I welcome the announcement on Monday by Ampol that it will not increase wholesale prices in the country over the Easter break. Any oil company, distributor or retailer exploiting motorists is warned that the ACCC will be closely monitoring prices over the Easter holiday. The ACCC will investigate cases of excessive price hikes and will be quick to act on any suspected price fixing and resale price maintenance.",109
88,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,109
89,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The government will not tolerate any party in the petroleum distribution chain attempting to rip off motorists over the Easter break. And look at the interjections from the party that sat on its hands for 13 years and continually refused to address this issue. You simply did nothing; you have no credibility whatsoever. Banking: Mergers,109
90,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to widespread speculation that the Wallis inquiry report, when it is released during our nonsitting period, will give the green light to mergers between the major banks. Is the Treasurer aware of the estimate last year by the financial analysts Baring MCIntosh that an amalgamation process creating only two major banks in this country could eliminate 35,000 jobs, and that mergers would certainly mean many more branch closures, particularly in rural and regional Australia? What, if anything, is the Treasurer prepared to say now to give comfort to those tens of thousands of Australians who are deeply anxious about their job security if mergers proceed and those many more Australians who are alarmed about the disappearance of banking services in rural and regional Australia?",109
91,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I told the House yesterday, I expect, after briefing cabinet colleagues, to release the report some time in the week commencing 7 April. Then we will be giving an indication in relation to some matters that can be dealt with immediately and, no doubt, deferring consideration of other matters which take further consideration. When that happens, we will be making a statement accordingly. Indonesia",110
92,Mr EOIN CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Given the importance which the government attaches to relations with Indonesia, can the minister inform the House of recent developments which affect that relationship?",110
93,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Answering the question gives me an opportunity to say something about the relationship between Australia and Indonesia. Australia and Indonesia will be launching the Australia Indonesia Development Area-or AIDAinitiative at a meeting in Ambon in eastern Indonesia on 23 and 24 April. I will be attending the ceremony on behalf of the Australian government, and the Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Production and Distribution, Hartarto, will attend on behalf Indonesia. This is a particularly positive new development in the bilateral relationship. AIDA, as we call it, the Australia Indonesia Development Area, has been developed on the Australian side in conjunction with the business community and also with state and territory governments. It is worth just noting hereand I am sure the member for the Northern Territory would appreciate this-that the Northern Territory government has done a great deal to lead the way in developing these regional contacts with Indonesia, and the Australia Indonesia Development Area is certainly going to involve the Northern Territory government in a very significant way. What it will do is create an enabling environment to facilitate Australian trade and investment with the eastern part of Indonesia. It is designed to facilitate such investment further in the region as a whole. Both governments see AIDA as being driven essentially by the private sector, which will come together in five working groups dealing with agriculture, fisheries, animal husbandry, education and training, mining and energy, transport and tourism. I believe that AIDA will very substantially benefit Australian business, but it is also a measure of the strength of the relationship between Australia and Indonesia that we have now developed the first such agreement with any country in Asia and of course therefore in the ASEAN region, the first such agreement ever. This supplements a great deal that has happened in the bilateral relationship between Australia and Indonesia over the last year. There was the ratification by the Indonesians of the agreement on maintaining security, which of course was negotiated under the previous government, and there was very recently the conclusion and signing of the Maritime Delimitation Treaty with Indonesia, which was an historic moment in the relationship between our two countries. And now that we have developed this regional link with Indonesia, linking Australia in a regional institutional sense with an ASEAN country in of a constructive way, which will be to the benefit of Australian businesses and jobs, I think the relationship with Indonesia is one which at the moment is in very good shape. Telstra",110
94,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Minister for Finance confirm reports that JORN could knock up to $1.2 billion off the value of the partial sale of Telstra? Are there any other liabilities related to the defence department that might affect the expected return from Telstra?,110
95,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I indicated the other day that there were a number of matters that would be looked at by the global coordinators, lead managers and government advisers generally in the lead-up to the sale of Telstra. That process has started. At this point in time, no reports have been received by me of any matter concerning the trading activities of Telstra which may be relevant ultimately to what must be disclosed prior to the sale to the public of the Telstra shares. But rest assured that all matters that are relevant and that ought to be disclosed will be disclosed. As to the specifics in respect of JORN, it is a matter which will undoubtedly be looked at along with all other trading activities of Telstra and, where it is appropriate to disclose to those that seek to purchase shares matters that will be of relevance to the future trading of Telstra, that will be fully disclosed at that time. Workplace Relations",110
96,Mrs JOHNSTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the minister aware of criticism of the government's industrial relations legislation that it denies workers sufficient protection? What is the minister's response?,111
97,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. Uniformly, across the ranks of the government, we are concerned to ensure that the package of reforms that we have put in operate fairly in the interests of employees. That is why, when you look at the legislation that was passed by the parliament last year, there are a lot of protections built in for employees. In fact, in some areas, we built in added protections. For example, we have very strong protections in our legislation both for people who choose to be in a union-that is fair enough and we protect that-and for people who do not want to be in a union. You do not have to be. We protect that basic right. We also protect people from the bullying of certain trade union leaders, who may not have a union member in a workplace, but want to tell non-union members about the deals they can enter into with their employers for the benefit of the employees. That is a protection that we provide for people. We have provided a protection more generally for people-that is, a system that gives them the opportunity of sitting down and doing a deal that will protect their job and give them greater security for that job into the future. The ultimate protection for most people is the protection afforded by having a job that is secure and that gives you an opportunity for career prospects in the future. It is very good to see. I see in the paper this morning a company offering 300 or more Australian workplace agreements. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that I am getting a lot of indications of companies and employees who want to do that. We know that APESMA-the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers, Australia-a leading union, has already acted as a bargaining agent in the public sector for the introduction of Australian workplace agreements. That is real protection. We have other protections for workers. We have protections in respect of other matters under the heading of 'discrimination'. They are important protections; they are backed up by fair remedies to ensure that they are adhered to. What is interesting now though is that there are increasing pressures on the Labor Party, under the guise of protecting employees, to go back to the old system. When you look at the old system and, in particular, at jobs created under the old and more centralised system where the awards were the dominant means by which terms and conditions were obtained and set, between July 1990 and March 1996-that six-year period with Labor in power-the total number of additional full time jobs created was a measly 7,100.",111
98,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Seven thousand. Mr Downer-Hardly 1,000 a year.",111
99,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They barely got to a thousand jobs a year. That was the high point, I suppose, of the failure of the old system. What I think ominous are the pressures from trade union leaders, not interested in protecting the jobs of the rank and file, but interested in protecting the jobs of the trade union leaders. They are putting the weights on the Leader of the Opposition to return to the failed policies of the past, the policies that gave us the worse recession since the Great Depression. As Labor said when they were in office, the way in which you give people a chance of higher living standards and jobs in the future is to give people at work greater responsibility and the opportunity to have terms and conditions to suit their employment. The sad thing in Australian politics is that this Leader of the Opposition can't even maintain the policy that they had back in March 1996. In fal:, as Gough said, you are going back to Scullinism. The implications of that are that people's jobs are not protected. In fact, that policy only jeopardises the very people when you claim to represent. Motor Vehicle Industry: Geelong",111
100,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that he and the industry minister refused to receive a petition today from 15,000 Geelong citizens, represented by the mayor of the City of Greater Geelong and the state member of parliament, expressing concern about the future of the car industry? Prime Minister, in the light of this overwhelming call for action from the battlers of Geelong and the Geelong community, why won't you act immediately to secure their future? Why won't you join them in backing Labor's plan to increase investment, expand exports and create 10,000 new jobs in this industry by the year 2005?",112
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have to say to the honourable member that I am not aware of any approach to me today to receive any such petition. I will check when I go out of the House. I am leaving the House to go to the airport to go to Singapore and China just after question time. When I go out of the House, I will certainly check. It is never my habit to be deliberately dismissive of or discourteous towards people. Having asked me the question, I relish the opportunity",112
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Banks!,112
103,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You would not see the Holsworthy people.,112
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Banks!,112
105,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You fobbed them off onto your minister.,112
106,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about the Holsworthy people?,112
107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Banks.,112
108,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He wants an Easter break or an Easter bunny. He is really a lovable sort of bloke, the member for Banks. He really is. I take the opportunity of saying a couple of things to the member for Corio. I understand his concern and the concern of other members in this place on both sides about the future of the motor manufacturing industry in Australia. Within a couple of months we will receive a final report from the Industry Commission and we will take decisions on that. Can I say, with the greatest of goodwill to the member for Corio-and I really mean that-that you really are trying hard to beat this issue up, aren't you? You really are. You are trying to make people feel as insecure about their jobs as possible because you think that will help your political purpose. The battlers of your electorate are a wake up to you and they are a wake up to all of your colleagues. You know what those battlers really remember. They remember that when you were in government-and they have quite long memories-you promised not to sell the Commonwealth Bank and you did, you promised not to sell Qantas and you did. Mr O'Connor-Boring! Boring!",112
109,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You say it is boring. Well, you are going to get more and more bored as the months go on. Every time. I hear somebody opposite say, 'Boring' I know it is not boring, I know it hurts. It does hurt because you mislead them. If you imagine that they believe your promises about the motor manufacturing industry now after your appalling track record of breaking your promises on things like the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas, you are completely mistaken. The employees of the motor manufacturing industry around Australia can rest assured that the decision we take will be in the long-term interests of that industry. Wool",112
110,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I ask the minister: when can wool growers look forward to the complete disposal of the wool stockpile which is currently overhanging the domestic and international markets? How will growers gain access to equity from the stockpile administered by Wool International?,112
111,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. He is by no means the only person in this House who is very concerned about the plight of wool growers, particularly specialist wool growers and the communities that they live in. Anyone with an interest in regional Australia will know that they have had six tumultuous and very difficult years. Even now as we speak, a marginal improvement, although we hope sustainable improvement, in the marketing prospects is starting to see a real promise of a brighter future. However, the really good news is that growers can now look forward to the complete disposal of the once enormous stockpile. It is now only 1.8 million bales down from 4.7 million. The debt is down from $2.7 billion to under $900 million today. I am pleased to be able to tell you and other interested members that today I announced the first step in downsizing the body looking after the stockpile, Wool International, building towards its complete abolition in the year 2000 when the stockpile is gone and the process of giving back to wool growers funds related to stockpile management-money that we never thought would be there just three or four years ago will now be there in large amounts. Growers will receive an early distribution of funds from Wool International to the tune of $75 million this calendar year. That will be the first of three or four tranches which will see the money returned to growers over the next three or so years as Wool International, under Dick Warburton's excellent leadership, does the good job of winding up this very difficult issue. This follows from an announcement I made last year in ending the tax on growers for this financial year. That was worth well over $100 million. Put the two together and these measures amount to around $200 million worth of relief for wool growers, with the prospect of hundreds of million of dollars further to come as the stockpile is disposed of. That is very good news indeed. When you couple it with the savings from our reductions in interest rates and all of those hard policy issues that we have been prepared to tackle, a real difference is beginning to flow in hardpressed regional areas. The government will allow growers a number of options in taking their total equity. Firstly, they can trade it in an open market if they want the money soon. Secondly, they can use it as security to borrow against. Thirdly, they can exercise the choice if they so desire to invest it or part of it in a proposed joint venture known as Global Wool. Fourthly, they can simply keep it as equity until it is available as cash. We said in the build-up to the last election that we would find the earliest means possible to return equity to growers and that we would do it in as flexible and multifaceted a way as possible to give growers real choice. That is what we have done. The equity to growers will be based on the wool tax paid between the financial years 1993-94 to 1995-96. In addition to that, I will be reducing the functions of Wool International and reducing the size of the board over the next little while in the build-up to the time when the stockpile is gone when Wool International will go as well. The government's most purposeful role in the industry then will be to facilitate trade access and market development, areas we have had significant success in since coming to power. The Deputy Prime Minister has done a lot of excellent work in this area, as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs. We can now, for example, in a very fortuitous arrangement, put Australia's wool tops into Mexico, value add them there and re-export into North America, also tariff free, under NAFTA. We have made tremendous strides with India, all of it very welcome indeed in terms of building a future for the wool industry. The wool industry has had six turbulent years as it seeks to adjust to very real pressures in highly competitive international textile markets. These measures will unquestionably help provide confidence for the industry that things are on the mend. There is no doubt that this is undeniably very good news for Australia's hard-pressed wool growers. Ships Bounty",113
112,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, in your letter to me today on the ships bounty you appear to confirm your statements of yesterday that you believe the government had ensured a level international playing field for international shipbuilders. Prime Minister, are you familiar with the Jones Act, a US law which allows no Australian built vessels to be sold into the US? Are you also aware that, according to a letter obtained from the department of foreign affairs dated 14 March this year, 'It is clear that early abolition of the Jones Act is not likely in the near term'? Prime Minister, why are you cutting away assistance for Australian shipbuilders when other countries refuse to remove theirs? Is this your idea of a level playing field?",114
113,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought the member for Hotham might ask this question so I did just a little research. I was particularly taken by his phrase 'cutting away assistance'. In 198384 the bounty was 27Yz per cent and you reduced it to seven per cent by 1995-96. That is not a bad effort. That is a very level playing field. Did you make any representations on the Jones Act in the course of doing that? I do know about the Jones Act. In fact, it is something that has been raised on a number of occasions by this government and it will continue to be raised. I stand by what I said yesterday. Organised Crime",114
114,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I address my question to the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice. Does the Attorney-General agree that effective anti-money laundering measures make a valuable contribution to Australia's fight against organised crime? Can the Attorney-General inform the House of initiatives being taken by the government to deal with international money laundering?,114
115,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am grateful to the member for the Northern Territory for his question. It gives me the opportunity to say something about important initiatives. A major driving force for organised criminal activity, particularly drug trafficking, is the fact that significant profits, very large can be made. These profits are often removed from Australia and laundered through a variety of overseas destinations. From time to time we see reports of successful operations against drug traffickers. It is little known that often the only reason those operations take place is as a result of input from the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, known as AUSTRAC. AUSTRAC has made a major contribution to our attempts to identify and prosecute money launderers. It monitors financial transactions through financial institutions such as banks, credit unions and building societies. Since 1989 Australia has been a member of the international group, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering. FATF has developed a blueprint for legislation and effective anti-money laundering practices. A FATF international expert group recently visited Australia and assessed its performance against the blueprint. I quote from the report: Australia can pride itself on a well balanced, comprehensive and in many ways exemplary system and must be congratulated accordingly. It meets the objectives of the FATF recommendations and is constantly reviewing the implementation of their anti-money laundering provisions, simultaneously looking well ahead to the future. Within Australia there is a money laundering task force which includes the National Crime Authority, the Australian Federal Police, state and territory police and other law enforcement bodies, as well as AUSTRAC. It is an outstanding example of cooperation between law enforcement agencies. It is interesting, and perhaps quite significant, that during question time today questions and answers have referred to Papua New Guinea, Singapore, China, Burma and Indonesia. In focusing on the region in that way, I have to say that regrettably money laundering is a regional problem as well. But, at a recent money laundering symposium held in Bangkok, Thailand in February this year, which 38 jurisdictions and major international organisations attended, Australia played a major role in achieving international agreement for the establishment of the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering. This is a significant step forward in recognising and profits, acting on a problem in the region. The government's approach is not limited to international action. The government's legislative action has also involved amendment of the Proceeds of Crime Act to enable Australia to share the proceeds of crime with a foreign country where that country has made a significant contribution to the recovery of those proceeds. This provides an incentive to some countries in particular to assist major criminal investigations in Australia. Solicitors have been identified by commissions and inquiries as a class which could be involved in money laundering. Amendments to the Financial Transaction Reports Act this year have required solicitors to report to AUSTRAC transactions involving $10,000 or more in cash. Cooperation at all levels is the key to tackling organised crime. These initiatives on a broad front help implement the government's law enforcement commitment by taking positive action to remove the major motivation for crime. Jobs North Program",114
116,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the award winning Jobs North program will shut down tomorrow? Is he aware that the program has found real jobs, unlike work for the dole, for nearly 1,000 long-term unemployed on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, with a success rate of 70 per cent? Prime Minister, why have you refused to continue funding this successful regional employment program in an area where regional unemployment has blown out to 15.9 per cent since you were elected?",115
117,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That question was from the former president of the ACTU, wasn't it? Was it from the same man who forced the former government to maintain an industrial relations system that destroyed tens of thousands of Australian jobs?",115
118,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order and it goes to relevance. The Prime Minister was asked repeatedly specific questions about a program that he has closed down, that provided 1,000 jobs in a very sensitive area. Instead of this arrogant blah, Mr Speaker, what we might get from him is an answer.",115

127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Resume your seat. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, my point of order is that is a frivolous point of order. It is clear that it is frivolous. It is not a point of order. We count these points of order as a sort of Geiger counter of the sensitivity on that side. That is not a point of order.",115
128,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,115
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Members on my left! Mr Reith-Either now or at some later time, I do believe that this practice of the Leader of the Opposition to raise points of order simply to use them as a front for making debating points ought to be brought to an end.",115
130,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise to speak to that point of order. It is perfectly legitimate under the standing orders to raise points of order on matters of relevance. It has always been interpreted by the chair that, when a highly specific question is asked, it gets a specific answer and the discursive questions are permitted of the discursive answers.",115
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I am listening very carefully to the Prime Minister's response. He is drawing on a statistical analysis and statistics from a wide range to support his answer. The answer is in order.,116
132,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"May I continue? During that same period, which I remind you and him covered the period from 27 December 1991 to 23 December 1993, a period of two years, the long-term unemployed as a percentage of the total unemployed rose from 28.1 per cent to 37.4 per cent. The youth unemployment rate rose from 30.2 per cent to 32.2 per cent during that same period. Mr Tanner-Give us '77 to '83.",116
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Melbourne!,116
134,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Might I say, I have been advised by the member for Cowper that the result of the particular programMr Tanner-Give us the figures from '77 to '83.",116
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Melbourne!,116
136,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The advice that I have from the member for Cowper is that the result of this particular program that involved the 1,000 people was 56 part-time jobs and 17 full-time jobs. If that information is accurate, and I have no reason to doubt it, I would not have thought that it was the most highly performing of all the job training programs we have seen in this country. On every statistical count, the member for Batman, the Leader of the Opposition and all the other members of the Australian Labor Party have no credibility at all on unemployment. I remind you again that you had 13 years to fix unemployment in this country. You drove it to a post-Depression high. You left it at 8Y:z per cent and the people out there are not listening to you on unemployment. Regional Development: Small Business",116
137,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Is the minister aware of impediments to small business growth in regional Australia? Can the minister advise the House how the small business package, announced by the Prime Minister yesterday, is going to assist rural and regional Australia?",116
138,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. He, of course, has had a long association with small business people in his electorate and has represented them very well over the last few years that he has been here. It is true to say that small business is the backbone of the Australian economy, but it is even truer to say that small business is the backbone of the regional economy of Australia. Anybody who understands the nature of the economy of regional Australia will appreciate that small business is by far the bulk of the economic activity in regional Australia. Unfortunately, though, as I am sure the honourable member for Hinkler would also appreciate, during the 13 years of a Labor government, small business in regional Australia suffered enormously. We saw some of the worse business conditions for small business operators in regional Australia that the country had ever seen during that 13 years of a Labor government and its mismanagement of regional Australia. During that period, an enormous number of business imposts were imposed on small business people around Australia which particularly affected small business in regional Australia. Business imposts such as the introduction of a capital gains tax, which is an enormous impost on small business people, are major disincentives for them to expand their business or to start a business and to employ people in regional Australia. We also saw the former Labor government, in its 13 years of mismanagement of this country, introduce a fringe benefits tax, which had a substantial disadvantage in terms of the book work and red tape that it imposed on small business, particularly small business around Australia and in regional Australia, particularly farmers. We also saw Labor's unfair dismissal provisions being imposed on small business, which had a distinctly severe effect on small business in regional Australia. Those sorts of imposts, be they tax imposts or paperwork imposts, were the legacy of 13 years of a Labor government. Of course, since the change of government in March last year, this government has been going about trying to absolve small business, be it in regional Australia or across the country, from those sorts of imposts. I am very pleased with the announcements made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs during this week. Indeed, throughout regional Australia, small business is saying that these reforms announced by the Prime Minister and the minister for small business are going to be an enormous incentive for small business in regional Australia. The changes to the capital gains tax, which were announced last year in the budget, and the benefits of which were extended to small business operators to enable them to plan for their retirement, will be of particular advantage to small business in regional Australia. The changes to the fringe benefits tax, particularly to the paperwork component for people in small business, again, will be a great boost to small business people in regional Australia. Also, there are changes to the unfair dismissal provisions, which are particularly beneficial for small business operators where they employ somebody with less than 12 months experience. Those unfair dismissal provisions, the exemption for those small business operators, will be of great incentive for small business in regional Australia to go out there and employ more people, particularly young people. There are a number of other initiatives that this government has undertaken such as the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust, which will spend $1.25 billion over the next few years throughout regional Australia; the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund, spending $250 million throughout regional Australia; the $3,100 million that is being spent on the Pacific Highway in regional Australia; and, the regional forest agreement, which is creating real jobs throughout regional Australia. All of these sorts of initiathat tives, coupled with the changes to small business announced by the Prime Minister during the week, will create real jobs in small business in regional Australia. Youth Unemployment: Green Corps",116
139,Mr JENKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of his promise that the Green Corps will 'take its place alongside other initiatives of the government to deal with the problem of youth unemployment'. Apart from it offering only 2,000 places against the 80,000 green jobs under Labor's Working Nation, how does the Prime Minister explain thataccording to information from the employment department-less than half the people in the first Green Corps intake were actually unemployed and only one in eight was long term unemployed? Will the Prime Minister increase resources for the Green Corps and guarantee that in future all places go to unemployed people?",117
140,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me tell the member for Scullin that the funding of the Green Corps will be considered alongside the funding of other matters in the normal ERC and budgetary process. The Green Corps was designed to respond to a number of needs. It was designed in part to respond to the challenge of unemployment, but it was also designed-and it was made very clear at the time-to encourage young people to involve themselves in the environmental future of Australia. I am glad that the member for Scullin has had something to say about the green policies of the Australian Labor Party, because it enables me to say something about the green policies of the Australian Labor Party. It enables me to remind the Australian people that you voted against the biggest spending ever on Australia's environmental future. It enables me to remind the Australian people that, at every tum, you have tried to frustrate such great national projects as cleaning up the Murray-Darling Basin. You talk about-ah!",117
141,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order which goes to relevance. What has massive slush fund for the Liberal Party got to do with the Green Corps and 1,000 jobs not going to the unemployed?",117
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I have extended to the Leader of the Opposition many courtesies today, but there is no point of order.",118
143,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You invited me to observe the environmental policies of the Australian Labor Party, and I am doing precisely that. I am observing that you voted against this enormous capital expenditure on Australia's environmental future. The Murray-Darling Basin is crucial to the future of about one-third of the agricultural capacity of the entire Australian nation, yet you are not prepared to support the expenditure of money to clean it up. And you think you can come in here and question us about our environmental credentials. You have no credit on the environment. Mr O'Keefe- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order which goes to relevance. What has this got to do with Green Corps? He won't answer the question.",118
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,118
145,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can assure you that when I was at Echuca, in the electorate of member for Murray, about two weeks ago at the opening of the new weir on the Murray and when I addressed a very large luncheon organised by the member for Murray, they see a very direct connection between helping regional Australia, job creation and having a sound environmental policy. All of those things came together at Echuca. It is a pity you had not been there, because you would have had a taste of the excitement in regional Australia feel.",118
146,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It must be now quite patently obvious that there is absolutely no relationship",118
147,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order?,118
148,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On relevance. There is absolutely no relationship between this prime ministerial rant and the question that was asked of him.,118
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Resume your seat! Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on the point of order: the response is clearly within the standing order on relevance. I say that because the question, first of all, contained argument which referred to your green policy, as you alleged it was, when you were in office, which was in breach of the standing orders, which say that questions are not entitled to include argument. When they do include argument, they invite us to respond to the argument that they have put and now they are claiming it is beyond relevance. It is clearly relevant, and it is just another irrelevant point of order.",118
150,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on that point of order: I will now read the question to you and make a judgment about that.",118
151,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,118
152,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why not? Can you recollect it all?,118
153,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Because I can clearly remember the question. Resume your seat!,118
154,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no mention of the Labor Party's green policies in it.,118
155,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Resume your seat! Before I call the Prime Minister to continue, in the the light of the emotional debate beginning to intrude into question time about points of order, I will be making a pronouncement to the House on the first day of the next sitting session-that is, budget week. Whilst you will have to await the outcome of that comment, it will draw questions, relevance and points of order together so that there is absolutely no confusion about where I am going to stand on these very important issues. In the meantime, that people I call the Prime Minister.",118
156,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To borrow another phrase from the opposition, I think it is now 'patently obvious' that the Australian Labor Party does not want to be reminded of the anti-job consequences of the stance it has taken on the environment. That is very obvious. Can I simply say to the member for Scullin that you would have more credibility on the question of job generation and the environmental future of this country if you had not set out to destroy, to stop and to frustrate the greatest ever capital expenditure on Australia's environmental future. The Australian people, particularly the young people of Australia, know that it is the Liberal and National parties that are for the environmental future of Australia and that you, the Australian Greens and the Australian Democrats voted against that future when you voted against the Natural Heritage Trust legislation. Small Business",118
157,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Much has been said in recent years about the need to improve the access of innovative small to medium sized companies to equity capital. I have a number of innovative firms in my electorate of Capricornia which will be involved in hosting Beef Expo 97. These are some of many that are constrained in their development and growth by a lack of finance. Can the minister please outline to the House how small business will benefit from the small business innovation fund? Can the minister inform the House what support small business has given to this initiative?  his question. There is no doubt that small business has welcomed the government's initiative yesterday in regard to the small business innovation fund announced by my colleague the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Indeed, the headline in today's Herald-Sun sums it all up-'Thumbs up for new fund'. Small business people who have contacted me-thumbs up-have well and truly supported the government's initiative in regard to this fund. That is in stark contrast to what happened years ago with the ill-gotten report, the Beddall report. I decided to look through this report-I dusted a bit more dust off, gave it a rub and gave it a bit of a puff up. The report said: A major area of demand for venture capital comes from small firms which need relatively modest amounts of finance. What do we do seven years later? They didn't do too much at all. People have been waiting for the growth of this area. Most people would know, particularly the small business sector, that in the new innovation areas, the only potential for growth, this fund will offer $130 million. Matched two for one this will be $200 million. It will give small firms of $4 million and below access to this fund. We think that this will help up to 100 small firms. The problem, as you would appreciate, for many small firms is that they can generally only grow by debt financing. They can grow only big enough to get to the point where they can take on a partner or go to a share market float. This fund gives them the ability to grow so they can make that choice. The interesting thing is what we are doing in this area. Unlike the previous government, we are doing something about it. The House will remember that there was a Prime Minister in the past-the May 1995 Prime Minister; I cannot quite remember his name: he has slipped from the Labor Party ranks-who said, 'It's never going to get any better; this is as good as it ever gets.' I can tell the House that now we have taken these sorts of initiatives things are going to get better. Things are getting better under the package the Prime Minister announced on Monday. It goes from the initiatives we announced, particularly in the area of the small business innovation fund. Small business has welcomed this. It gives new innovation firms the opportunity to grow.",119

191,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (3.37 p.m.)by leave-Earlier today I launched the National Indigenous Australians' Sexual Health Strategy 1996-97 to 1998-99. This is the result of many months work by a group of people originally chaired by Dr Ian Anderson and subsequently chaired by Deb Reid. It is an important report and I am pleased to give to the House the government's response to that report. I first became aware of the potential threat that HIV posed to indigenous people in late 1991. I was camping out north-west of Alice Springs. It was the end of the year and it was ceremony time. While I was there, someone came to me and raised with me the case of a teenage boy who during the ceremony had been cut with a knife and picked up the gonorrhoea bacteria. Because it involved a cut, he had a particularly nasty thing called a balanitis that required him to be airlifted to hospital and put on intravenous antibiotics. It struck me then that, if you can pass the gonococcus bacterium, you can also pass HIV. The more I looked, the more I became concerned that, many years into the HIVAIDS epidemic, we have not had any nationally coordinated response to the threat that HIV-AIDS poses to indigenous communities. In 1994 I had the opportunity to visit Zambia and Uganda to look at what happens in a rural community where HIV hits particularly hard. In southern Uganda, the Rakai province is part of the world epicentre of HIV-AIDS. I still remember the very harrowing experiences there. In the Rakai province, one in six people in the entire province are orphaned childrennot one in six children, but one in six of the population of the province. One would go into a village and find 50 women and three men. The rest of the men had died. Half the women were HIV positive. I remember particularly visiting a house mid-afternoon. It was a mud and reed thatched hut and it had eight orphaned children between two and 16 years of age living there. Their parents had died two years previously. They had no possessions whatsoever. Two of the middle aged kids were out in the bush looking for food. They had to borrow a stool from a neighbour so that I did not have to sit in the dirt. Their nearest relatives were over two days walk away. Orphans have turned out to be the major problem in particularly heavily hit areas of HIV in the Third World. Kenya, when I was there two years ago, was estimated to have 150,000 HIV orphans. By the year 2000, it is estimated that Kenya will have a million HIV orphans. The thought of a million uneducated, unsocialised, hungry kids on the streets of a country I find truly frightening, and of course there is nothing that eastern Africa can do to stop this scenario happening. Australia has had a very good response to HIV-AIDS generally. It has been characterised by two things. One is a strong sense of bipartisanship which has enabled us to get on with the job and the second is, probably flowing from that, a strong degree of pragmatism by trying to minimise harm rather than focusing on strategies that are less effective. Because of that, in the broader population we find the instance of HIV declining as well as life expectancy going up because of recent improvements in treatment. Indigenous people are different. They are different for one very simple reason: it has been shown in Africa and it is now well known around the world that a significant cofactor in the transmission of HIV is the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases. It has been known for a long time that in particularly rural and remote areas there is a very high instance of sexually transmitted diseases in the Aboriginal population. This has made it very, very difficult to do anything in a concerted way. You have to ask yourself why it has taken 15 years for something to happen, and I think the answer is that people have felt it is just too difficult. Certainly in talking about this over the last six years, I have been abused, I have been yelled at and I have had people ask me why I was bothering because it is a white man's disease. There are two things that come out of this report today that give us the first real dramatic hope in 15 years of experience with this epidemic. The first, as reported in the Lancet in late 1995, came out of a study in Tanzania. It was shown very clearly that a strategy that focuses on the reduction of sexually transmitliving ted disease also reduces dramatically the transmission of HIV. So it is very clear that our strategy must be not just a HIV strategy but a sexually transmitted disease strategy. The second-which I think is actually the best news I have heard in Aboriginal health for a very long time-is the work, as yet unpublished, by Dr Frank Bowden and Dr Christopher Fairley, who both work in the Northern Territory. They undertook some quite brilliant research that does both of them very great credit. They developed a new way of looking at sexually transmitted diseases in the indigenous community. It was by tampon testing-a very high degree of acceptance and a high degree of confidentiality. Of course they confirmed what was well known: that the rate of sexually transmitted diseases in the indigenous population was high. What they then did that was brilliant, though, was to decide to look at wart virus, which no-one had done before. Wart virus is unable to be treated. It is thought to be one the factors in developing cancer of the cervix. Given that it is untreatable, it is an indicator of the number of partners one has over a lifetime. What they found was quite surprising. They found very clear-cut evidence that in fact the average Aboriginal woman will have fewer partners over a. lifetime than the average European woman. This goes right against the stereotype that many have believed has been responsible for the high rate of sexually transmitted disease. It leaves us only with one inescapable conclusion: the high rate of sexually transmitted disease in the Aboriginal population is a result of the fact that they do not have access to basic services that the rest of the Australian population both expects and takes for granted. The issue is not principally one of promiscuity. This is a wonderful message of hope, because it means there is actually the potential to do something. We should have known this. Intuitively it is right. In the Kimberley between 1985 and 1995, there were only three shires that had Aboriginal medical services. Those three shires that had Aboriginal medical services dropped the rate of gonorrhoea amongst men by two-thirds. Adjacent shires that had no community controlled Aboriginal medical services did not have a reduction in the rate of STDs. So it tells us for the first time that we have a real prospect of making big inroads here by providing basic primary health care. This strategy focuses on four main areas that I will run through briefly: prevention, treatment and care, work force issues and building partnerships. For treatment and care, we will be funding population STD programs and we will be extending primary health service coverage. In treatment and care, we are looking at treatment and support programs both in urban communities and in rural communities. We are looking at education strategies and issues around confidentiality and privacy because, if one is going to extend testing, clearly they are paramount issues. We are also looking at donovanosis, which I will mention in a moment. Under the work force issue we will be of funding a specialist training centre. We will be providing more Aboriginal health workers to do the hard slog on the ground. Under partnerships, NACCHO, the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, and ANCARD, the Australian National Council on AIDS and Related Diseases, will be working hard to forge stronger links. I want to talk briefly about three areas that I find particularly exciting. The first is donovanosis. I had never seen a case of donovanosis in medical practice in my training or in my time as a medical practitioner, yet 10 years ago in parts of Central Australia 10 per cent of the population had donovanosis. It is a horrible, disfiguring disease, transmitted sexually, that results in very gross ulceration. Donovanosis, because of the great ulceration, is a major co-factor in the transmission of HIV. It is almost unknown outside the Aboriginal population. We have reduced the rate dramatically in the last 10 years. It is not nearly as bad as it was 10 years ago. The World Health Organisation has a target to eradicate donovanosis from the world by 2010. I say here today that our aim is to eradicate it from Australia by 2003, within five years. The introduction of a single dose drug, Azithromycin, which ·is currently going through the processes of PBS approval, gives us a real chance to eradicate this scourge. The second thing about which I am particularly excited is the provision of additional male and female health workers. In the end, this is going to be won on the ground in Aboriginal communities, by Aboriginal people, and this strategy seeks to give them the resources to do so. Thirdly, there will be provision of a specialist training centre. In 1994 I visited a place called Chitenkarta in southern Zambia which was run by the Salvation Army. It was a hospital that ran what was regarded as the world's best centre for HIV-AIDS education. There were people there from the Philippines, Jamaica, India, Sri Lanka and all over Africa. It was funded by AusAID. While I was proud that Australia was funding it, I was, quite frankly, angry that I had to go to southern Zambia to see this and that there was not such a facility in our own country. We will be funding such a facility to train Australians and, hopefully over time, Pacific and Asian neighbours so that they may be able to come to northern Australia rather than go to southern Zambia. Finally, I have been very concerned that all these things that we do build on existing programs and work to strengthen communities because, in the end, communities have to be strong to fight something like this. There are a few people I would like to thank: Rob Griew in my department who has done a fabulous job helping to shepherd this through and Deb Reid and her working party. They are too modest to put their names on their report so I would like to read them out so that they can be incorporated in Hansard: Deb Reid, Ian Anderson, Stephanie Bell, Sol Bellear, Colin Ross, Neville Fazulla, Michael MCLeod, Pat Swan, Vicki Jones, Edna Brown, Yoko Nakata, Elsie Nawia, Debra Bennell, Rob Guest, Trevor Woodhead, Vanessa Read and Bill O'Loughlin. I want to thank the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations who were obviously a bit nervous about extending the focus of HIVAIDS into Aboriginal populations but have been very supportive. Finally, I must thank Dr Ian Anderson who chaired the working party until November 1996 and subsequently has been working in the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services. He was out of the Victorian Aboriginal medical service. He is one of Australia's few Aboriginal medical practitioners and this simply would not have happened without him. All in all, this offers us some hope. It may only be the beginning of the beginning, but those people who have been involved in HIV for 15 years have known the potential despair here. This throws some light on it, this opens up hope and this means that we can actually make a difference. I present the following papers: ANCARD working party on indigenous Australians' sexual health-National indigenous Australians' sexual health strategy 1996-97 to 1998-99, March 1997. National sexual health strategy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people-Ministerial Statement, 26 March 1997.",122
192,Mr LEE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-This is not an occasion for tub thumping. The basic reason for that is that the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people remains devastatingly worse than the rest of the Australian population. Some people still do not accept and understand that indigenous Australians die as much as 20 years earlier than the rest of us on average. They have infant mortality rates which are up to four times worse than the general population. Indigenous Australians have much higher rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and the issue we are focusing on today-sexually transmitted diseases. Dealing with these issues and the profound inequalities remains a matter of national importance, and the opposition welcomes the statement by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and the development of this national sexual health strategy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We would also like to congratulate the Australian National Council on AIDS and Related Diseases working party on the preparation of this report. As the minister has pointed out, Dr Ian Anderson, I understand, was appointed by Dr Lawrence some time ago and, together with Debra Reid, has done an excellent job in chairing and helping produce the recommendations from the working party. Obviously, this deals with issues that are quite sensitive to any Australian, but in particular we have to be careful that the media treatment of some of these issues does not result in people being insulted or issues being dealt with in an insensitive way. In many ways, I think this report is an example of the way forward for Aboriginal health in Australia. Aboriginal people must be the key policy makers in Aboriginal health and, wherever possible, local communities must control as well as support those service providers. In a number of recent visits to Aboriginal communities, one of the strongest messages has been that services with a high level of community involvement and control are far more likely to be successful if you combine that local control and community involvement with strong leadership and adequate resources. Then you have the best chance of success and improving the health of Aboriginal Australians. We join the minister in thanking the working party for their efforts in producing this report. I hope, with appropriate support from the government, that this report will provide the basis for improving the sexual health of Australia's indigenous people. The report shows that one of the key risk factors for HIV-AIDS in indigenous communities is the high rates of sexually transmitted diseases and that these high SID rates are the result of poor access to primary care facilities. The minister mentioned before the excellent work which has been carried out by Dr Frank Bowden and Chris Fairley. I would like to quote a short extract from the working party's report: ... preliminary analysis of a study of STD transmission in the Northem Territory suggests that the main determinant of high rates of STD infection in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is poor access to treatment, not the number of sexual partners. On the basis of this, to assume that strategies to reduce the duration of STD infection, through appropriate primary health care, will have a substantial effect on the rates of STDs in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. As the minister has pointed out, we are hopeful that that will also result in a lowering of the risk of the transmission and acquiring of AIDS. Effective health promotion and disease prevention must involve education and effective delivery of services. I welcome the fact that the minister has not for the first time put on record his belief that Australia has responded well to the threat of AIDS. I think he is right when he says that that is the result of the bipartisan attitude we have had to this and the fact that we have focused on trying to minimise harm. For the majority of Australians these campaigns have been supplemented by access to high quality medical services under Medicare. The same cannot be said for many indigenous Australians who do not have acceptable access to primary health care services. Therefore, the opposition welcomes the government's and the working party's focus on primary care services. However, this support for the government's initiative is not unqualified. One of the key messages I received in recent visits to Alice Springs, Port Lincoln, Cairns and Cape York was the vital importance of community involvement and control. The other message is one that I am sure the minister has heard both in government and in opposition and that is the need for additional resources. There is a dangerous fallacy about Aboriginal health, and it is the claim that vast amounts of money have been spent and that nothing has been achieved. I happen to think that both parts of this argument are wrong. In recent years additional money has been made available for Aboriginal health and Aboriginal medical services in particular, but the level of service offered in most Aboriginal communities still remains far below that which most Australians take for granted. I think also it is absolutely wrong to suggest that this money has not led to significant improvements over it is now safe the last decade and a half. The minister has already quoted the improvements in gonorrhoea rates amongst men in the Kimberley and the areas where the three Aboriginal medical services have been in operation. Last week I was advised by a person who works for the Aboriginal medical service in Alice Springs that birth weights for Aboriginal babies are now higher than birth weights for non-Aboriginal babies at Alice Springs hospital, which is a bit of a surprise given past history. The problems in Aboriginal health are enormous and will take a long time to tum around. Additional money committed five years ago is not going to affect Aboriginal mortality statistics for many years to come. What we do know is that some Aboriginal health services have been able to achieve significant improvements. A couple of weeks ago in Lockhart River I was able to learn from that community that they now have immunisation rates up to 98 per cent-a much higher rate than the rest of the Australian community has been able to achieve. The reservations that the opposition has about the package are not due to any concerns about the aims, the direction or the commitindigenous ment of the minister. Our concerns relate resources. I note with concern that the money for today's announcement is not new money but has been found by 'reordering our priorities within the public health program'. In the last budget the Minister for Health and Family Services announced extra funding of around $20 million for Aboriginal health services. Unfortunately, when we read the print we found out that, at the same time, there had been an across-the-board cut three per cent to Aboriginal health services, taking back some, if not all, of that additional money. The net additional effect was almost nil, unfortunately. In the last budget we also saw cuts, if not massive cuts, to ATSIC funding, but we did receive the assurance that health, employment and education programs would be quarantined from the cuts. The message have received in Aboriginal communities that they believe that these cutbacks are having an indirect effect on health and emthere ployment, if not education. Several communicases, ties have given me examples of cutbacks have been made by ATSIC as a result of last year's budget. Those cutbacks are affecting health programs. One example I would offer the minister is the decision to cut back ing for some women's programs which have, in tum, funded clinics which have provided well women's checks in some Aboriginal communities. Also, there have been decisions which have affected the number of places available under CDEP-a program that has funded an imAboriginal provement in health infrastructure in many Aboriginal communities and an improvement in environmental health in many of those communities as well. I accept that the Aboriginal minister has a genuine commitment to these issues and a real desire to bring about constructive change, but I think all of us underminister's stand and accept that, unless he is able convince his colleagues to find additional money to fund these additional much needed primary care services, progress will be slow. I would also like to mention the minister's belief that this issue of sexual health in communities is of such vital to national importance that it will not be broadbanded and handed over to the states. That is a decision I welcome and agree with. On the two major public health issues on which the minister has taken a strong public stand-that is, immunisation and indigenous sexual health-he has rightly argued that these are so important that they need a national response, a response guided by a hands on fine federal minister for health. The opposition believes that this is the correct approach and of remains very much concerned that a number of other issues that are worthy of a national response and that are worthy of a hands-on approach from the federal minister for health do still seem to be under consideration to be significant handed over to the states. I am not quite sure the minister remains confident of being able to hand over some of those responsibilities to the states, given I recent comments on Lateline, but I am sure is he understands our concern that in many of these areas we still need to make sure that are national standards requiring, in many funding which will only be available that from the Commonwealth government and which will require a federal minister for health to be strongly committed to them. There is still no framework agreement fundbetween the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory government. I am sure the minister would like to see a framework agreement completed as soon as possible. Until that is completed, I am sure it is very difficult for not just the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services but many of the medical services in the Northern Territory to see clear evidence that the Northern Territory government is as strongly committed as the rest of us to improving health and, in particular, working with community controlled medical services. In conclusion, the opposition welcomes the statement. We endorse the strategy to that he has unveiled today. We congratulate the working party on its report and we remain committed to working with the government and with indigenous communities to try to implement these many very worthy recommendations. NA Government",125
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The competence of the government which is presiding over rising unemployment, low growth, collapsing retirement benefits and a decline in Australia's standing in the region. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",128
194,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There are a couple of points that I think we can make at the outset here, and that is what has been evident over the last three months where we have had an opportunity to judge the administrative competence of this government, the goals that it sets itself, its actual achievement in terms of management of the economy, its ability to protect people in their retirement and to provide educational opportunities, access to decent health care, job security and a general feeling of security of life within the communiafter ty. In meeting their obligation to ensure in each of these areas people's sense security and achievement is enhanced, we dealing with a very ordinary government indeed. I know the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) likes to make a virtue of the fact that he is not exciting, but that does not mean he ought to make a virtue of the fact that he is not contributing to anything other than a sense insecurity he sought to exploit when he came into office and which he has done nothing address. It is no surprise that, after 13 years in office, we should find that the public is necessarily going to spend a great deal of time, for a period of time, taking much notice of us. So the fact that the odd public opinion poll might reflect that is a bit neither here nor there. But what is interesting, when a Prime Minister comes into office and says he wants to make people feel relaxed and comfortable-and that is the leitmotiv of his government-is to find after 12 months that respondents are saying they feel a higher level of insecurity. That, indeed, is a commentary. There is now a higher level of insecurity, despite the fact that the economy inherited by this Prime Minister was one that he described as being better than good in parts, despite the fact that we had substantial growth in employment going on in the economy, despite the fact that we were improving private savings in this nation through the provision of a superannuation scheme that was giving people substantial opportunities, despite the fact that we had universal health care, despite the fact that there was a growing participation rate at all levels of the education system, with young people having a real opportunity to get into education processes and ultimately into jobs and despite the fact that we held our heads high in the region around us. That was the position this Prime Minister inherited. And on each one of these critical elements of life in this nation and of the development of public policy he has failed tests that the community would set him and, indeed, tests that we would have expected him to have set himself. What an extraordinary thing it is that a year a government has been in office-and that here we go to the question of standards; of recollect that standards were one of the are matters on which he wanted to be judged because he was somehow going to lift public standards-we find there is no ministerial code of conduct. We have had ministers resigning but there is no ministerial code. In the Public Service there is a routine developing as far as the ministry is concerned. Be it of Minister Vanstone or Minister Kemp, whenever a problem is created it is either a case of to 'The dog ate my homework' or 'A public servant did.' What an extraordinary thing it is that the not Australian Financial Review, a paper which could be expected to be sympathetic to this government in all its aspects, comes out and says this: As one of his core election promises, Mr John Howard pledged to restore trust and honesty in government. To fulfil this tattered ethical vow, he must ensure that a much more thorough investigation of Senator Mal Colston's unjustified misuse of parliamentary perks than has been presented so far to the Australian people. But the interesting comment in that-and we found plenty of interest in it-is 'to fulfil this tattered ethical vow'. That is their view after the Bob Woods affair and after the Prime Minister's appearance on the Ray Martin show. That is their view after Senate Vanstone's regular appearances before Senate committees to explain herself. That is their view after the sorts of revelations we have had about Minister Kemp's achievements in his portfolio in administering those labour market programs that they signed up to. That is their view after the Treasurer (Mr Costello) stood up in this place and claimed that a promise that he made to protect the savings of our retiring people is a promise we made and he did not, ignoring the promise that he made. That is their view of this government, a government that has exhibited, as far as ethics are concerned, all the manifestations of a tattered ethical vow. Well might they say that about Senator Colston. I do not want to dwell on that figure at any length in this place. Senator Colston will find himself with a more than an interesting enough next six weeks without anything that I can add to it. The Australian Financial Review had this to say about that very brief answer the Prime Minister gave yesterday, saying: Mr Howard yesterday denied this'this' referring to something the Prime Minister personally intervened on: an approved wage rise for the particular staff member who did, according to Senator Colston, eat his homeworkamounted to any 'inducement' for Senator Colston's vote. Yet, the timing of this pay risejust before Senator Colston's vote allowed the Government's Telstra bill to pass the Senatesuggests otherwise as long as the Government continues to resist a genuine investigation into the senator's affairs. So it is a tawdry, ordinary government producing tawdry, ordinary policies that are obtaining the contempt of their colleagues in the states and in the community generallythose sections that looked to them with great expectation when they came into office. Jeff Kennett's speech yesterday on industry policy was absolutely priceless. It was a ringing endorsement of the industry policies that we had and have subsequently put out. In fact, I am going to stick it into Mark Latham's particular box on the subject of plagiarism so Jeff does not get off this exercise scot-free. Nevertheless, Jeff has had a few things to say about the performance of this government on industry policy. He said: Australia without an industry policy will be a country without friends or refuge in an increasingly competitive and clever world. In the last year we have seen some policy decisions made by the Federal Government which have been more damaging to industry than probably realised at the time of their announcement. For example, the decision to reduce support for research and development and the increase in HECS fees for science and engineering courses have contributed to an impression that the Commonwealth Government does not value R&D. The scrapping of DIFF took away a key diplomatic and industry development strategy. The proposal to shutdown Radio Australia seems to have been put forward without consideration of the goodwill the service generates for Australia in the Asia-Pacific. Similarly, the current consideration of future arrangements for the pharmaceutical industry is worrying as I fear the industry's issues are being blurred with health policy issues. Our objectivethis is what he says about himselftherefore, is to establish the framework and directions for a national co-ordinated policy based on sustaining high rates of economic growth. Governments must work together in a co-ordinated way to develop this new industry policy. I do not actually think that Jeff yet thinks that he is Prime Minister of this nation. He obviously has the Prime Minister in mind as to where he might end up. Either that or he speaks with the royal 'we', but he cannot speak with the royal 'we' as far as the nation is concerned. He is not there yet. But that is what comes of lifting industry policy bolus out of the Labor Party's platform. Nevertheless, the point is made, and the point ought to be taken, that there is no industry policy being operated by this government. You can smarm and slip and slide your way around it, but there are consequences. You will recollect the situation that I referred to that they inherited when they came into office. Contrast that with what per cent unemployment, a $25 billion budget deficit, an inflation rate of 11 per cent. That is what we walked into. It took 13 years for this nation to develop amnesia about John Howard. If a week is a long time in politics, think about 13 years-13 years to develop that amnesia about the John Howard record back then in 1983. But hasn't it all come to pass for them again. And those mournful statistics are coming through yet again. 'Judge us on 12 months,' he told the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) at the beginning of the year. 'Don't ask me any more questions about unemployment. Judge us on 12 months.' Here is the 12-month record. In the last Labor year in office total employment grew 176,000; in the first Howard year in office total employment grew 89,000. In the last Labor year in office total full-time employment grew 112,000; in the first year of Howard in office employment grew 6,000. Male full-time employment-these are the bluecollar battlers that John Howard is aiming at-in our last year in office grew 57,000; John Howard's first year in office, minus 12,600. Number of unemployed: in our last year in office, down 26,000; John Howard's first year, up 44,000. Long-term unemployed-and remember that it is always the long-term unemployed who are in the position of the most tragedy-in our last year in office, down 45,000; in John Howard's first year in office, up 44,000. The teenage unemployment rate in our last year of office fell from 27.7 per cent to 26.8 per cent; in their first year in office it was back up to 28 per cent. That is the record on which John Howard wanted himself judged. When the Prime Minister came into office he invited us to hoI us- judge him upon that basis. But there are many things we can judge him on as well. We have had occasion to make remarks about his personal promises and that of his government on the position of our people in retirement in the years to come: savings of the nation, and retirement benefits for our people, and that superannuation scheme that we put in place subjected to the most fiendish vandalism since this governwe did: 11 ment has been in office. But there will be a test for them when this next budget comes round. They acknowledge-and the public knows-that they have just whacked $100,000 off the retirement package of somebody on average weekly earnings. So, when these tawdry little so called savings vehicles get trotted out in the paltry little manner with which they will be trotted out when that budget comes down, what the public needs to remember-and we will be giving them the question over the next six weeks-is that they paid for it with $100,000 on the day they retired. They have to think about whether or not they think it is worth it to get a little savings vehicle to pay for education which currently they receive free but which it is foreshadowed by the National Commission of Audit they will be paying for as tire years go by. They will have to think about whether losing 100 grand on their date of retirement was worth that-whether they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and more secure about it when they do. Then they can contemplate too what has happened to the universal health care system. It is being sliced away, one slice of the salami as each year goes by, so that more and more people receive this sort of correspondence from their doctors as was received by one constituent who wrote into us: Dear Patient, As from the 20th February 1997 we will not be accepting Medicare cheques as full payment of any accounts. Pension and Health Care Card holders will now be charged the schedule fee which will mean out of pocket gaps for each item number used. If you wish to know the exact amounts please enquire at reception. That will be a story that is going to be told in doctor's surgery after doctor's surgery around this nation for pensioners and for everybody else in that Medicare system, as this government slices the salami and removes the public from that universal health care system that they had. Finally we come, as the Prime Minister is about to go away, to the care and maintenance of our standing and reputation overseas. He goes overseas to kowtow. That is the position of the Prime Minister. He is obliged to kowtow for this reason and this reason only-having so dishonoured us in our relationship with the Chinese by his cancellation of the DIFF program and by his stupid performance in overstating our relationship with the United States, he now finds himself in this position where he has to cancel meetings with people like the Dalai Lama and the Taiwanese because he will create more of a crisis than he has already created himself. Things that could once be done in a canter by the deputy leader on visits to the Chinese can no longer be done. On every front this nation has lost standing. People have lost standing within it and access to decent public policy; people have lost access to decent ministerial administration and national dignity. An ordinary performance  months. Nothing we see of you at this point of time suggests for one minute that it is going to get any better. (Time expired)",128
195,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"1 hope the opposition members, as they leave the chamber headed towards the Easter break, feel better. I was contemplating what earthly reason would drive the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to do an MPI at four o'clock without a broadcast on the last day before Easter. I tell you what: it is not a message for the public because the public - n't listening. It is not a public message. Is It a message to the gallery? Well, it is nice to see the gallery here, but it is not a big crowd, you would have to say. So who must these messages-this grab bag of cliches and rhetorical flourishes-be for and what would be the motive for them? I am sorry I missed the first few moments. I apologise to the Leader of the Opposition. I was dragged away on official business. It was reported to me that, in your early remarks, you had a little defence slipped in there for your backbench. That was to the effect: 'Listen, don't worry about the polls.' I tell you what: many a time. I have heard a Leader of the Opposition-although perhaps not as early as 12 months out from the last election-say that. It does betray a certain level of insecurity when a Leader of the Opposition has to get up and defend himself only 12 months from the last election about the latest polls. You have reason to be concerned about the polls. The reason for your concern is you show no signs whatsoever of yet appreciating why you got turfed out just over 12 months ago. You show no signs whatsoever of having a sense of what most Australians think on some of the mainstream issues. I want to refer to one of those as an example of that in a moment. The other incredible aspect of the Leader of the Opposition's speech which caught me is that Labor was in for 13 years and here he is up with this MPI talking about the competence of the government in respect of unemployment. He says this without any rouge in the cheeks whatsoever. It is absolutely incredible that, after 13 years of a long Labor government, you have the gall in here to attack us on the changes that we are making to fix up the mess that you created. Take your last six years in office and the actual number of full-time jobs created: according to the ABS figures the total number of additional full-time jobs was 7,100-7,100 jobs in six years. And he's got the cheek to get up here and say, 'We had 13 years. You can forget about that. This is what you should have done in 12 months.' What a particular hide it is when we are doing the things that need to be done to create jobs and you spend all your time trying to deny us the opportunity to do so by using your numbers in the Senate to try and prevent the solutions or remedies needed for the problems you caused. It is not only the unemployment numbers on which Labor's record is no good; I took out some figures in respect of underemployment, which you don't often hear of. The fact is that underemployment was much worse under Labor than under any previous government. Under the Fraser government, the highest underemployment rate was 4.1 per cent. Under Labor, it was 7.1 per cent. The combined underemployment and unemployment rate under Labor peaked at 18.2 per cent in 1992. Mr Latham-How was that measured?",131
196,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is interesting. You are the assistant to the shadow treasurer and you don't even understand the official ABS figures on underemployment. Look at the record of the Leader of the Opposition when he was the minister responsible for employment. He has an MPI up today attacking the government's employment record. He actually was the minister from the end of 1991 through to the end of 1993. During that period, when he was directly responsible, the number of unemployed increased by 34,444; the unemployment rate increased from 10.4 per cent to 10.6 per cent; the long-term unemployed increased by 95,000; the long term unemployed as a percentage of total unemployed increased from 28.1 per cent to 37.4 per cent-that is a massive increaseand youth unemployment increased from 30.2 per cent to 32.2 per cent. It is unbelievable. You were in office years. We are now on a long-term program to fix the problems. You are attempting to prevent us from fixing the problems and then you come in here late on a Wednesday afternoon to try to give us a serve about what we have been doing. Let me tum to policy responses and a couple of things that this country needs to do to fix up unemployment. Let's have a look at your response to it. It is a bit of a hide for you to be attacking the solutions which we have been putting. I say it is a bit of a hide on your part because a number of the big changes we need to make are changes you yourself said were necessary when you were in government. Now you try to do all you can to prevent us from introducing policies you used to support. It is incredible hypocrisy. If you take my area of industrial relationsMr Latham-Oh, not that '93 speech again.",132
197,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What is wrong with the '93 speech? That was a speech of the then Labor Prime Minister. It was a speech which contradicted the policy he ran with in the 1993 campaign. But, after the 1993 campaign, he got up and basically took some of the policy that he had just been running a scare campaign against in the 1993 election. Then, after the election campaign, he said: Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitration tribunals. It is a model under which arbitrated awards and arbitrated wages increases would be there only as a safety net. You are opposed to that now. Your shadow ministerMr Latham-No, no.",132
198,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What have we got? A split in the ranks? Your shadow minister walked away from that proposition the other day. Do you know why we know he walked away from it and how significant it was? Because the Leader of the Opposition endorsed his position the day after on the Sunday program. To make the message even clearer, Jennie George said that she welcomed the change in for 13 Labor's policy. Well, when the ACTU is welcoming a change in your policy then it is pretty obviously a change in policy and it is pretty obviously a change for the worse. It is not just what Paul Keating said in 1993. Laurie Brereton, the member for Kingsford-Smith, in relation to his so-called reform bill-one of the great failures of Australia's industrial relations policy development-said: This legislation marks the culmination of the government's break with the past--)Ur move as a nation from a centralised to a decentralised industrial relations system to a system based primarily on bargaining at the workplace with much less reliance on arbitration at the apex. There you are. In 1993, your then Minister for Industrial Relations said, 'We're moving from the past to a new future.' He substantiated why he was doing it. The reason that it was being done was that you believed then that that was what had to be done to create jobs. That was your policy back in 1993-that you needed to have a more decentralised system to give greater responsibility to people at work for what they get paid and how they get paid. That is what you said was a good idea. You said that that would raise living standards. Of course, you failed to introduce a bill which actually provided for that, but that of course is usual for the Labor Party. When you were legislating what was the barrier you were always up against? It was that the ACTU basically did a veto on that proposition. But you publicly advocated a more decentralised industrial relations system, and you now are walking away from it. It is an interesting contrast. When Labor was doing the things that they were doing in government in terms of reform, the fact is that, by and large, we were prepared to support them. The political climate for the tariff debate was that we believed that the Labor government ought to have gone further and should have been matched by cuts in the costs of running business. That was basically the position that we took through the late 1980s and into the early 1990s. In other words, you basically had our support. On privatisation, you are usually against it before an election and in favour of it after an election. But, in those circumstances, we supported you. In respect of fiscal policy, I was the shadow Treasurer for three years. I can point you to the transcripts where you would bring down a budget with expenditure cuts and I would be on the radio the next morning saying that we agreed with you. The contrast between the irresponsible behaviour of this opposition to the approach that we took to good economic policy when we were in opposition is very stark indeed. You are under a misapprehension. You think the quick political cheap point is going to serve your political interests to undermine the existing government. I tell you, people are not going to be impressed by that. They basically know that what you are saying on these things cannot be trusted. You were against privatisation before the election, then you were in favour of it after. In respect of industrial relations, Keating campaigned against our IR policy before the 1993 election and after the election basically endorsed it. In respect of a range of matters, we get this flipflop policy. We have it again on industrial relations. In respect of Labor's policy on enterprise bargaining, go to what was said in the Accord-your favoured Accord. The fact is this is what the accord said about jobs and the like: The accord parties are strongly committed to the extension of enterprise bargaining. The government and the ACTU will promote and facilitate workplace bargaining as the primary means for delivering outcomes which maintain and improve living standards. That is not your policy today. When you were in government you said that the direction we needed to go was to increase living standards to give people jobs. It is incredible hypocrisy for the Leader of the Opposition to try to soothe and console the opposition backbench who are worried about a decade in opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) is here. He will be either knifed or do the knifing himself, I am sure, in the next couple of years. Mr Latham-The author of Fightback is a political genius.",132
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl)Order! The minister will resume his seat. I strongly advise the member for Werriwa to cease interrupting and carrying on from the sidelines or he might be sent off.,133
200,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They live in hope about something happening to improve their position. As Gary Gray said the other day, you have not even maintained your status quo as at the last election. You are going backwards. There is another decision that you have failed to make but will need to make shortly on the question of unfair dismissals. The Labor Party has been all over the shop on unfair dismissals since the fateful day that Laurie Brereton introduced that scheme based on an ILO convention. You still have not come to grips with the fact that all small businesses in mainstream Australia want is a fair system. It is interesting that you cannot even bring yourself to support publicly a sensible measure that would encourage small business to give somebody a job. In our small business package, which has been so well received around the country in the last couple of days, one of the measures that we announced was that we would introduce a regulation which would provide an exemption in respect of small businessesdefined as businesses with less than 15 employees-that they would be exempt from the operation of the unfair dismissal in respect of new employees in their first 12 months of operation. That is in conformity with the ILO convention. There are a number of other countries with whom we would normally compare ourselves who do this. One of the shadow ministers in the upper house was publicly reported as saying that he supported it, and now you cannot get round to standing up and saying, 'This would be a sensible measure to create jobs.' So you are attacking us on our unemployment record, but publicly you cannot even bring yourself to support a relatively benign, simple, clear but beneficial measure to improve employment. There is a long record of Labor's difficulty with dealing with this issue, and I brought this Financial Review poster I am holding upMr Adams-You are not allowed to do that.",133
201,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will put it down. But it says, 'Dismissals-Keating backdown.' That was during the election. Keating said would be the big issue, and in the middle the election he had to back down on one his IR policies. You are going to have to back down on this IR issue as well. The reason ought to do so is because, quite frankly, listening to Jennie George and George Campmove bell-who is coming here---on the question of unfair dismissal will not put you in contact with sensible policy to give people the chance of a job. (Time expired)",134
202,Mr GARETH EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There are a great many ways in which this governopposite, ment has failed to inspire, to perform and to deliver in the last 12 months-not just the last 12 minutes. But none have mattered more than its failure to deliver on jobs and growth. You have had 12 months to establish your credentials and your credibility, and you have comprehensively blown it. Take the question of growth for a start. You inherited an economy that was romping along at an average of over four per cent over the previous three years. You predicted that it would grow at 3Vz per cent this year. It needed to grow at four to 4Y2 per cent if you were going to make a significant impact on unemployment. In practice, in your first nine months of office it has been growing at just two per cent. You had the total number of hours worked last year actually declining-the biggest fall since the depth of the recession which occurred in 1991. You have had unemployment rising from 8Y2 to 8.8 per cent. You have 40,000 more people unemployed today than was the case when you came into office last March. You have higher youth unemployment-now up to 28 per cent. You have 25,000 more people unemployed in regional Australia. You have 44,000 more long-term unemployed than was the case a year ago. You have 32,300 fewer full-time jobs than was the case at the time of the last budget. You have job creation running at just around 6,000 a month since the budget, which is less than one-third of what was achieved during our period in office. The basic responsibility of any halfway competent, halfway decent government is to try to achieve full employment and to ensure IR an increasing standard of living for its of country's people. It is the case that full of employment, as we have traditionally known it, may now be a long way away. But that is you no excuse whatsoever for the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) abandoning all responsibility to significantly towards it, repeating last week his prediction that we will not even see five per cent unemployment in his lifetime. There is no excuse for a government not to make the reduction of unemployment the This government has done the absolute worshipping at other shrines: Thatcherite shrines, small government shrines, shrines at which you do what you think the top of the town wants, although you do not always get that right, and you treat people's welfare as a last residual-not the primary object of government's policy but simply what you can do only when everything else is fixed, if it is ever fixed. In the 1980s the approach adopted by this government used to be called the 'trickledown approach' by Reaganites. A rather more graphic description now current in the economic literature is the 'horse and sparrow' economic approach, in which, if you feed the horse enough grain maybe enough comes out the other end to feed the sparrows as well. But that is not the kind of approach that makes any sense at all in the present condition of the Australian economy, and to approach economic management in that way is a comprehensive abdication of any kind of moral responsibility or political leadership. What should a competent government be doing to generate jobs and reduce unemployment? There are four basic elements in any job generation strategy by any halfway competent government. This government has failed in every one of the four elements of that strategy. The first thing you have to do is generate internal demand through appropriate combinations of budgetary and monetary policy. The second thing you have to do is hitch onto external demand. This is particularly crucial in an economy like Australia's, linked as we are to the Asian region where that demand is out there waiting to be tapped-and to do that means sensible trade and foreign policy. The third thing you need to have in any sensible job generating strategy is a proper industry and regional development policy to ensure that generalised demand is translated into specific business and job generating opportunities and activity. The fourth thing you need is the supply side of it, and that is education, job training, skill training and job readiness. They are all the things that have to come together if you are going to deal with the situation that this country is presently confronting. They are the four elements of competent economic policy, and this government has failed in every single one of them. So far as, first of all, internal demand management is concerned, they have abandoned the principle of going after maximum possible sustainable growth. From our point of view in the Labor Party, we take the view-and we will continue to say this over and over again-that it is just as great, if not greater, a sin to grow the economy at slower than its sustainable potential as it is to grow it unsustainably fast. That is the state of mind and the basic economic perspective you have to have if you are going to make any sense of dealing with an economy in the difficulties that the Australian one is in so far as unemployment is concerned. The government's approach has been absolutely to the contrary of that: excessively contractionary budgetary policy, excessively nervous and cautious monetary policy at a time when Australia's debt and deficit performance, by international standards, is such as to make it possible to be rather more adventurous on both those fronts. So far as external demand is concerned, it is absolutely crucial to have the kind of trade and foreign policy that enables a country to lock into what is going on in the region and to add to the limited demand-creating potential that we have in an economy of our size. But that means a trade policy that has to actually work and not a trade policy that has been accompanied-as this government's has been in the last 12 months-by the debacle associated with the DIFF affair and the debacle associated with the pursuit of 'aggressive bilateralism', in which the only aggressiveness was shown by countries like the United States giving us a great whack over the ear on issues like Howe Leather, leaving the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) lying prostrate, looking absolutely feeble and impotent, with his Akubra over his schnoz and his R.M. Williams boots upturned We have had a trade outlook statement making it clear that all the international action, if the Australian economy is to grow and lock into the region, has to be in the area of value added services and manufactures, and yet we had the primary industry spokesman, John Anderson, saying the other day that Australia should focus more on improving exports of raw materials than on developing processing industries, ignoring every lesson that every country in the region has long ago learnt about what you have to do to move the game forward. Foreign policy is actually crucial in this context because it sets the ring within which discretionary decisions are made by other governments and by major business leaders. How a country is perceived by other elites, political and economic elites, matters in terms of the way in which they respond to what you have on offer economically. And, let me tell you, how other countries are perceiving our trade policy and our foreign policy in particular at the moment is a cause for national shame. People keep saying to me I must, as a former foreign minister, be delighted to see Alexander Downer making such a comprehensive fool of himself in foreign policy as he waddles and limps his way around the international arena, but I do not get any delight out of that. It makes me positively depressed because I want to see an Australia that is proud, creative, imaginative and respected in the region and the wider world, not this kind of capital 'L', capital 'A' Little Australia that we see at the moment with no visibility, no respect, no credibility. This is a country in which the Hanson debate legacy lingers on, as we saw from Goh Chok Tong's statement earlier this week. It was made clear yet again by a respected South-East Asian leader that Australia manifestly lacks respect in its political leadership because of the failure to respond clearly and strongly when that debate was running last year. The Prime Minister's own idea of an overseas trip is to get the ferry from Circular Quay to Manly. There is no more parochial, inward looking, small-minded leader in the recent history of this country, and it hurts. Around the world, if people think of Australia at all, they think of us as small-small in stature, small in credibility, small in imagination, small in moral commitment and small in competence. That is the characteristic of this government. That incompetence has also, of course, been shown in so many other ways. So far as the industry and regional development side of job creation strategy is concerned, we have had a government that has mounted a budgetary assault on the export market development grants, on industry bounties, on research and development, on just about every single aspect of a comprehensive and sensible industry policy. There is no industry policy so far as this government is concerned. All they have on offer to fill the vacuum is a silk handkerchief wearing, fob watch bearing, gin and tonic drinking streak of aristocratic insouciance. That is all they seem to be able to manage so far as an industry policy is concerned. We did have an industry policy. It was systematically dismantled by this government. It has to be systematically rebuilt with a specific focus on regional Australia. So long as it is not, this government will stand condemned. This is a relentlessly small and smallminded government. It is a government passionately committed to the past. It is a government locked in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s-John Howard's intellectual and emotional resting place. It is a government with a passionate commitment to the values, attitudes and environment of the past, it is a government with no vision of the future, and it is a government with an utter inability to manage the present with any sensitivity, decency or effectiveness. If anyone has been in any doubt at all in the first 12 months of this office, they have had those doubts comprehensively put to rest. Finally, to adapt the words of the Prime Minister in question time today, this is a government with neither zeal in the general nor capacity in the particular. (Time expired)",134
203,Mr HICKS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I just cannot believe this matter of public importance today. This is absolutely astounding. These people must be masochists, obviously. Fancy their talking about unemployment, about interest rates and about things like that. I just cannot believe it. It was the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), who used to be the Minister for Finance, who left us with a $10 billion deficit. We have to try to find that money. How dare he come in here and make a speech like that. I really cannot believe it. These people have short memories. Do you remember when we had nearly one million unemployed? You do not have to go back to 1984, just go back a few years. We had farmers in my electorate paying almost 27 per cent effective interest rates. They were in my office crying. They could not feed their children. They had to give up their farms, properties and businesses that had been there for a hundred years. This former government-this former leader, the now Leader of the Opposition, and these people combined-did more damage in the bush in Australia than rabbit plagues over the last 100 years. That is what they did. People have left the bush. We have shops in small towns closed up. Certainly the droughts came on, but you people did more damage, as I said before, than all the rabbit plagues and all the droughts over the last hundred years. It is disgraceful. You come into this parliament to tell us about unemployment-nearly one million unemployed. The disgrace of the matter is that you achieved some objectives-I do not know if they were objectives or what they were-but former Prime Minister Keating, whom you are trying to now distance yourself from, had his hand on the levers, he said, and he had about a 30 per cent unemployment rate amongst our young people. That was terribly damaging in the bush and, of course, all those young people have had to leave and try to find work in the city. A lot of them having problems doing that. You were the government, and in this MPI you are now talking about presiding over growth, collapsing retirement benefits and Australia's declining standing in the region. Let us talk about things like numeracy and literacy. Why do these young people not have jobs? You were in government for 13 years. I might add, it is not only your fault; I think the rot set in when Whitlam was in government, and it has not got any better since then. I think Hawke and Keating-the same Bollinger socialists-just came along and set this nation on the downward spiral. Let us have a look at youth unemployment. Firstly, this government has now brought in a scheme whereby we are going to do something about education-literacy and numeracy-for the young people of this nation so they can get a job. You took the number of apprenticeships down to the lowest level in 30 years. Who would take on an apprentice under your industrial relations policies? You would have to have rocks in your head, quite frankly. That is one of the reasons why our young people cannot find unemployment.",136
204,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Riverina will address his remarks through the chair, not to the chair in that manner.",137
205,Mr HICKS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. We know that you were trying to get the unemployment numbers down, and you had people staying on in high school. That was very laudable. But a lot of those young people did not want to be in high school. Why didn't you bring in some traineeships like we are doing and create real jobs? We talked about the jobs north program-l,OOO jobs. Under your scheme, as the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) said, 56 part-time jobs and 17 full-time jobs were created. How much did that cost the nation? I have had people come into my office talking about some of these schemes that you people brought in. One woman came to me and complained about one. I did not take it any further, but she said that they went into the classroom and they asked, 'What we will talk about today?' 'Let's talk about sex,' are someone said. So they talked about sex. You can imagine what sort of a learning process that was. It is diabolical. These are the training programs you people had in place. And you have the unmitigated cheek to come in here and talk about unemployment and the direction this nation is going in. I just really cannot believe it. You criticise us about regional development. Have a look at your regional development policy, the better cities program. Nearly 50 per cent of it went to the cities. You were calling suburbia regional Australia. What were you doing in the bush? Absolutely disgraceful. Regional development-what a joke! Then, of course, we talk about low growth. I know where you are trying to come from, but the people of Australia have long memories. I was despairing there for a while after the last election when we were defeated, but then I looked at what happened in Victoria, in South Australia and in Western Australia. You broke those states. I think it is going to be years and years still before they come good. And that affects the whole nation. People understand what the Labor Party stands for. It really does stand for low growth. Not low growth-it stands for negative growth. You keep going backwards. It is like you are on a treadmill; you are not getting anywhere. At least we will make some of the hard decisions to try to get this nation on its feet and to get this nation going. Let us talk about this $10 billion deficit. You say we have not done anything. That is like trying to turn the Queen Elizabeth around in about two seconds. You cannot do will break its back. It takes time to get these things going. After you have been there for 13 years-and before you, Whitlam-imagine how long it will take to turn things around. We have a desperate situation and, as I said before, we will turn it around. We will make some of the tough decisions that have to be made. Have a look at your archaic industrial relations system, for example. Now you are talking about going back to the archaic system because Jennie George is not happy. You have two former members of the ACTU in here. That does not bode well for the of the opposition. If they ever get back into power again, heaven help us. Have a look at the waterfront. They spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the waterforest front-golden handshakes and worse-and we are slipping backwards. They are all back there. The whole thing has not changed. At least we have a minister there who is going to try to do something about that. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth E-as) said, 'The basic element for a good economy is internal demand.' When you have nearly a million people unemployed, as you had, how can you have internal demand? He talked about being comfortable. How could you feel comfortable in an like that? Then he said, 'We need external demand.' How can you export things overseas when you have these transport costs, the to waterfront costs, and an industrial relations system that is archaic? You cannot compete. I spoke about regional development. You were not helping those areas. It is the rural areas that create the wealth of this nation. You have mining and farming, first of all. If you destroy them, you do not have an economic situation in Australia. We all know that. But what did you do to rural Australia? All you did was take all the young people out and lose their jobs. Let us look at education, skills and training. We have already spoken about that. What did you do there? You put in place some of those hopeless training systems where people got on the end of the line, went through the system, came back on the end of the line and kept it. You going through-they got giddy. Let us have look at New South Wales. I am pleased to see that a number of state parliamentarians are going up to Lake Cowal today. Lake Cowal is the site of a goldmine that we were hoping would get going. In New South Wales, the hospital system is falling apart, they cannot build the roads, they cannot do anything and yet the state government knocks back a mining venture which has passed all the environmental inspections and tests. You just wonder how anyone who is worried about the development of Australia could do things like that. We have already mentioned South future Australia, Queensland and Victoria. Have a look at your forestry policy: lost jobs in the forest areas, lost resources income and, of course, you left a lot of it on the floor just to go to waste. You can go on and on about it. Now we have a backflip on tariffs. I say to the young people from various schools who visit this parliament that we in this nation have to be not only as good as other nations but better than them in everything we do. In our education systems, in our training, in our produce and in our exports we have to be better. We are in a very competitive part of the world and unless we do something very positive in the industrial relations system, we will only shoot environment ourselves in the foot. I am asking the opposition to think very seriously about these matters, and not come the parliament with this sort of thing. Have a look at your record and have a look at the things you are doing now-being obstructionist in the Senate-when we are trying to tum the whole ship around, to get it on the right track so that, firstly, young people in Australia and all Australians have work and, secondly, enjoy a good standard of living and a good quality of life. It is now up to this government, which has been elected overwhelmingly by the people of Australia. Your people have deserted you in droves. They have come to us and said, 'For heaven's sake, do something for us. Make sure that we have an Australia we can be proud of and an Australia in which we can raise our children and grandchildren in the way we would like to raise them.",137
206,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The discussion is now concluded. NA Members' Interests Committee,139
207,Mr REID,COMMITTEES,"As required by resolutions of the House, I table copies of notifications of alterations of interests and a statement of registrable interests received during the period 12 December 1996 to 25 March 1997. Publications Committee",139
208,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"I present the ninth report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-agreed to. NA (NOTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Reith, and read a first time. Second Reading",139
209,Mr REITH,INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme, NICNAS, was established under the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 to assess the health and environment risks of all new industrial chemicals and selected existing chemicals. All new industrial chemicals are assessed before their importation or manufacture so that recommendations about appropriate safeguards can be made before their use. Chemicals already in use and causing concern can be selected for assessment as priority existing chemicals. In total over 700 industrial chemicals have been assessed in the six years NICNAS has been in operation. NICNAS has operated on partial cost recovery since its inception. This bill, and its cognate bills, will move NICNAS to full cost recovery consistent with other Commonwealth chemical assessment schemes. Currently, costs are recovered by a system of application fees for the assessments carried out. This has worked well for new chemicals. On the other Report hand, the current scheme for existing chemicals does not result in costs being shared fairly in the industry and has been described in a 1995 review as 'virtually unworkable'. To rectify this problem, the bill will implement a system of 'company registration' to replace the current fee collection mechanism for existing chemicals. The bill establishes a Report new register, called the Register of Industrial Chemical Introducers. All persons who introduce industrial chemicals with a total value of more than $0.5 million will be required to register and pay a registration charge. Company registration was first proposed by the previous government in 1995. Following extensive consultation with industry, we have refined the scheme to minimise its impact on business. A two-tier system of registration charges will apply. The $0.5 million initial registration threshold will ensure that small business will not be affected. For companies introducing chemicals with a value of more than $0.5 million but less than $5 million, a maximum annual charge of $1,200 will be payable. However, for companies introducing chemicals to the value of $5 million or more a year, a higher annual charge will apply. This will not exceed $7,000. Based on available data, it is estimated that approximately 600 companies will pay the lower charge and 190 will pay the higher charge. Company registration will enhance the operation of NICNAS by overcoming problems in the current cost recovery mechanism for existing chemicals. Costs will be shared more widely in the industry. Registration will also facilitate the operation of NICNAS by improving knowledge about the companies introducing chemicals in Australia. The government will review the new cost recovery arrangements in three years time. More effective and efficient cost recovery will also improve the assessment of existing industrial chemicals. The bill introduces a framework for better targeting of assessments to the specific risks posed by particular chemicals and allowing for a group of chemicals to be assessed together. A three-year program of existing chemical assessments will be developed in consultation with industry, participating agencies and other stakeholders. The program will be consistent with national priorities and needs, tailored to concerns and will make maximum use of appropriate assessment information from overseas. Based on anticipated revenue from the registration charge, about 10 comprehensive assessments and 40 more limited targeted assessments would be completed every three years. The bill also makes important changes to the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances-the inventory. The inventory lists all chemicals imported or manufactured in Australia since 1977. Persons introducing a new chemical can apply for the chemical to be included in the confidential section of the inventory if publication of the chemical's particulars would be commercially damaging. The current arrangements which automatically cancel any confidentiality after six years have the difficulty that they may discourage overseas manufacturers from making new chemicals available in Australia. The amendments allow the continued listing of chemicals in the confidential section subject to review every five years. The test for inclusion in the confidential section has been strengthened. Currently, only the prejudice to the commercial interest of the person or company is considered. This will be changed to require the director to balance that prejudice against the public interest in disclosure. Measures to streamline the assessment of new industrial chemicals are necessary to secure the benefits of new chemicals quickly without unnecessary assessment. The bill proposes new limited exemptions from notification and assessment for research and development chemicals and for chemicals introduced in quantities of less than 10 kilogram per year where the chemical poses no unreasonable risk to human health or to the environment. These changes are consistent with developments in schemes operated by our major trading partners and are justified by assessment experience. In addition, a new form of permit will be established to allow the introduction of certain non-hazardous chemicals before the assessment of the chemical by NICNAS is finalised. This amendment will facilitate the early introduction of new chemicals to replace older more hazardous ones. To increase accountability for the management of NICNAS on full cost recovery, I propose to establish a non-statutory industry consultative committee. This will review and report to the minister on the use of resources and recommend future improvements to NICNAS operations. The bill also makes minor amendments to improve the operation of the act, including by updating certain definitions. In summary, this bill, like the cognate bills, is aimed at further enhancing the operation of NICNAS by introducing full cost recovery, and streamlining assessment procedures particularly for new chemicals introduced in very low quantities and for non-hazardous chemicals. Greater flexibility in the assessment of existing chemicals is proposed so that they are directed to areas of concern. The changes are consistent with the recommendations of the 1995 Gwynne report which considered the implications of full cost recovery for NICNAS. As a result of these reforms, assessments under NICNAS will be able to focus more on the chemicals posing the greatest risks to the Australian people and the environment.

This bill will impose a charge on the manufacture or importation into Australia of certain industrial chemicals to the extent that the charge is not a duty of customs or excise.

213,Mr RUDDOCK,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the provisions of the Health Insurance Act 1973 which relate to the professional services review scheme to remove difficulties encountered since the scheme commenced in 1995. The scheme was introduced by the previous government with bipartisan support and it is hoped these amendments will receive the same support from the opposition as did the original bill from the present government. Inappropriate medical practice is a matter of concern to this government and these concerns have been highlighted in recent times as the oversupply in medical practitioners places greater pressure on practitioners to increase patient throughput and, in some cases, engage in significant overservicing. Overservicing is detrimental to the health of patients and comes at a very high financial cost to the health system. The previous government recognised that the measures in place prior to the professional services review scheme were not working and set about introducing a new way of investigating allegations of overservicing and inappropriate practice. The professional services review scheme is this government's primary means of investigating allegations of inappropriate practice and taking action when those allegations are proven. The refining and strengthening of the professional services review scheme provided by these amendments should not be of concern to the majority of practitioners. However, those practitioners misusing or deliberately abusing their privileged positions of trust under the current benefit arrangements are able to be investigated under this scheme and will be dealt with severely. The government will continue to pursue practitioners found abusing the system - clarifying Under the professional services review scheme sanctions are imposed by the determining officer following a peer review and a finding that the person under review has engaged in inappropriate practice. The separation of judicial and executive power is a foundation principle of the constitution and the provisions in existing section 106U have been amended to ensure that there can be no doubt that judicial power is not being exercised by the executive under this scheme. In place of the sanctions in paragraph 106U(1)(d), the periods of disqualification from access to Medicare in subsections 106U(3) and 106U(4) have been increased to three years, and I have made it clear that where the sums involved are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and a person's peers have found that there has been inappropriate practice, the determining officer must obtain the proper recovery of taxpayers' money. The extremely large sums of Medicare benefits involved in cases of inappropriate practice under this scheme is something about which it is expected Australians will feel justifiable outrage. Whilst the determining officer has a discretion to deal with degrees of culpability, the minister expects that in cases where the determining officer considers that there is a high degree of culpability, the full force of the sanctions in section 106U will be applied and a substantial proportion of the amount will be required to be repaid and the person will be disqualified for Medicare for a long time. No-one can condone abuse of Medicare and cases with a proven high degree of culpability involving hundreds of thousands of dollars warrant strong action at the top end of the measures provided in section 106U. In addition to the amendments that remove any doubt about the separation of judicial and executive powers, the bill makes a number of changes to improve the administration of the process of reviewing a practitioner's conduct. These include: - bringing the class of practitioners in Parts V AA and VA of the act into line with definitions contained elsewhere in the act; the test under which a committee reports on the conduct of a practitioner; - providing a clearer approach to calculating the amounts of Medicare benefits to be repaid; and - repealing the sampling provisions which have proved to be unworkable in practice. As the minister has said, the professional services review scheme is the government's primary means of investigating allegations of inappropriate practice and taking action when those allegations are proven. The proposed changes are essential to ensure that the scheme is given every opportunity of achieving the objectives intended when first introduced in 1995. I also present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (ACTIVITY TEST PENALTY PERIODS) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",141
214,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill introduces changes to penalties which are applied where recipients of newstart allowance or youth training allowance do not meet their obligations under the activity test provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 or the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973. In its first budget, the government announced a range of measures to tighten the administration of the activity test applying to unemployment allowances. In doing so, the government met a specific coalition pre-election commitment. The range of measures announced, most of which have already been introduced, received considerable support within the community. The government considers that a rigorous application of the activity test requirements is important to maintain community support for, and confidence in, the system of unemployment payments. It also sustains active job search which should improve employment outcomes for people receiving unemployment allowances and contributes to the efficiency of the labour market. This approach is supported by Australian and international economic research which points to the importance of maintaining strong job search requirements as part of an efficient system of unemployment allowances. For instance, the OECD Job Study concluded that 'A priori reasoning and historical evidence both suggest that if benefit administration can be kept tight, the potential disincentive effects of benefit entitlement will be largely contained'. The previous government's own Committee on Employment Opportunities discussion paper titled Restoring Full Employment also concluded that 'any impact of the income support system on long term unemployment is likely to be minimised when the administration of income support, and in particular the activity test, is tight'. In developing the package of measures to improve the administration of the activity test, the government recognised the need to change the current regime of penalties applying to those who breach their activity test obligations. The current penalty arrangements are too complicated. Penalties can vary according to unemployment duration and previous breach history. Unemployed people do not know what penalty might apply to them and even DSS and CES staff have difficulty working them out. For such penalties to act as an effective deterrent to non-compliance, they need to be known and understood by unemployed people. The government, therefore, proposed changes late last year in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 to simplify penalty arrangements, strengthening their deterrence effect while removing some features which have been criticised as particularly harsh and unfair such as increasing the penalties the longer a person had been unemployed and allowing the penalty period to increase indefinitely. Community views were heard around this time encouraging the parliament to amend the existing and proposed activity test penalties from a complete withdrawal of payment to a limited rate reduction. The government had already moved to convert administrative breach penalties to rate reductions rather than full withdrawal of payment. The Minister for Social Security agreed to withdraw the proposed changes to activity test changes and consult further prior to introducing a revised approach. Under the provisions of this bill, penalties for breaches of activity test requirements will be as follows: for a first breach within any two-year period an 18 per cent reduction in the rate of allowance for a period of 26 weeks; hr a second breach with any two-year period a 36 per cent reduction in the rate of allowance for a period of 26 weeks; and for a third or subsequent breach within any two year period, withdrawal of payment for 13 weeks. Given that the penalty arrangements are changing significantly, to avoid any element of retrospectivity and so that all unemployed people will know exactly where they stand, any breach occurring after the commencement of this bill will count as a first breach. The bill will also provide that penalties waiting periods for payment will be served concurrently with the higher penalty taking precedence. At present, such penalties and waiting periods must be served consecutively. The government considers that it is necessary to maintain a non-payment penalty for a third or subsequent breach within two years. To simply allow a further rate reduction would allow someone to continue to receive unemployment allowances-albeit at a reduced rate-indefinitely even though they continually refused to meet their reasonable and legitimate obligations. The new approach to activity test penalties provided for in this bill has been developed to take full account of the concerns about the current penalty arrangements and after consultation with community welfare groups. It is an approach which is fair, eliminating the worse and most complex features of the current arrangements but still meeting the government's objective to maintain a strong deterrence for failure to meet reasonable requirements. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin) adjourned. AGED CARE BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mrs Moylan, and read a first time. Second Reading",143
215,Mrs MOYLAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. NA On the February 10 this year I circulated a statement entitled 'Steps to Better Care'. This statement detailed the government's commitment to a new era in the provision of residential aged care in this country, based on dignity, comfort and security for all. I am delighted now to introduce the Aged Care Bill 1997-a major piece of legislation that will guarantee positive outcomes for older Australians. It will see the most signifiand cant reform of aged care services in Australia for over a decade. It will be the beginning of this government's major structural reforms in a sector of the Australian community wilfully ignored for 13 years. This legislation delivers on the government's 1996 budget announcements and election commitments to build a secure future for older Australians in partnership with the aged care industry. This bill replaces the provisions in the National Health Act 1953 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 under which nursing home and hostels are currently administered and on commencement the Aged Care Income Testing Bill 1997. It is essential we undertake reform now, to meet the challenges of our ageing population. In a little over 30 years, Australia's population of over 65s will increase by more than 50 per cent to 5 million people. This bill provides the path forward. It maintains what works well in the current system and makes improvements where we have learned from experience. It also makes clearer that for those permanently entering residential care this is their new home. As is the case in society more broadly, there is an expectation those who have an ability to provide for their accommodation costs should do so. Home and community care services are not covered by this bill as they are administered jointly by the States and the Commonwealth under the Home and Community Care Act. However, the bill provides important links with the wider spectrum of care in the community. Together with the home and community care program, older Australians are now able to gain access to a wide range of services according to their needs and preferences, whether in their own home or in residential aged care. NA This bill recognises over the last decade that services provided by nursing homes and hostels and the care needs of residents have become increasingly similar. Today, there is a significant overlap in the frailty of residents in the two systems. There are also funding gaps. This is particularly the case for older people with dementia. This is an inequitable situation that must be addressed. This bill will align classification and funding arrangements. This will provide better assessment of the physical and mental frailty of all residents and ensure residents are funded properly according to their care needs no matter where they are residing. To complement the alignment, there will also be changes that will mean less unnecessary red tape for nursing home providers so they can get on with the job of providing quality care. Changes to nursing home financial accountability will facilitate enterprise bargaining and work force adjustment. This streamlined system will be similar to the way hostels have operated successfully for many years with a focus on outcomes for residents rather than inputs. NA Currently, nursing home residents pay only a standard fee representing 87.5 per cent of their pension towards their daily living costs. Hostel residents pay 'variable fees' which do not have an upper limit. The government believes this system has passed its use-by date. Therefore, the second major reform contained in the bill is income testing of all people who receive residential care. Income testing is being undertaken by the departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs using the current income assessments routinely carried out in determining entitlements to pensions and benefits. This includes the maintenance of existing pensions free area. The determination of income for people already in receipt of Social Security or Veterans' Affairs pensions or benefits will therefore be based on their existing available income information. They will not have to provide additional details. People will, however, be able to request a review if their circumstances have changed. In addition, people who are not satisfied with decisions made about their income will have a right of appeal, using existing appeal mechanisms, that is, to the relevant department and then to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Under the new system all nursing home and hostel residents will pay a basic daily resident fee as they do now. This fee will be based on 85 per cent of the pension. However, there are limits to what a person can be asked to pay. The most anyone will have to pay is approximately $60 per day, indexed. Individuals will gain access to residential aged care based on needs, not means. NA NA The bill embodies strategies to bring about improvements to the unacceptably poor quality of many nursing home facilities. It encourages nursing homes to invest in lifting accommodation standards to a quality level all older Australians can enjoy. Entry contributions will now be known as 'accommodation bonds' to better reflect their purpose-a bond designed to provide a valuable source of capital which will help improve and maintain the quality of residential aged care. They will also be extended to nursing homes. Let me emphasise, only those people who enter a nursing home after 1 July 1997, who have not already paid one, and can reasonably afford it, may be asked to pay an accommodation bond. A nursing home cannot ask its current residents to pay a bond. People who currently reside in hostels will have their existing agreements honoured and residents will not be required to pay any extra. A bond will operate as a capital deposit which the provider holds while the resident is in the facility. When they leave it is refunded, less a modest contribution of up to $2,600 indexed per year for up to five years. The balance will go back to the resident when they leave or on their death as the case may be. I want to stress people will not pay twice if they move to another facility. The bond from the first facility will be rolled over to the new facility. There is also a range of payment options consumers can choose that best suit their individual circumstances. Residents who receive respite care in residential facilities will not pay an accommoincludes dation bond. Before a provider can charge bond, they must meet set standards for buildclearly ing quality and care through a process of certification and ultimately accreditation new independent Aged Care Standards Agenrequirements cy to be established from 1 January 1998. Mandatory prudential arrangements will be implemented to protect the bonds people pay. PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO CANto the NA There will be protections for people who cannot pay and these are clearly outlined in OTHER CHANGES the bill. Concessional Residents To ensure a place for those who cannot pay an accommodation bond, every residential care facility will be required to set aside minimum number of places for concessional residents. Concessional residents are people who are full or part pensioners, who have owned their own home in the past two years and have assets under two and one-half times Other Benefits the single age pension-about $22,500. The number of concessional residents will be set in each region according to local need, and providers will receive a higher governresidents ment subsidy for these residents. Concessional residents cannot be charged an accommodathe tion bond. This will ensure that access to care will continue to be on the basis of needs not means. Secondly, the bill contains specific hardship provisions for people entering care who will leave a spouse, long-term carer or resident family member in their home. In these cases the family home will ted in determining whether a person can reasonably pay a bond. NA NA Ensuring Rights and Quality The bill provides strategies for ensuring the rights of aged care recipients and the quality of care are maintained and strengthened. The legislation is based on the premise of helping to ensure aged care recipients enjoy the same rights as all other Australians. The bill also a range of sanctions for the small a numbers of providers who do not meet their defined responsibilities. These are responsibilities in relation to meeting user by a rights, quality of care and accountability imposed in relation to Commonwealth funding. There are, of course, appropriate notification and review provisions for the decision to impose sanctions, however, where there is an immediate and severe risk safety and well-being of care recipients the notice provisions can be waived and a sanction imposed immediately. The bill also builds in increased flexibility that will be to the benefit of consumers. It allows the Commonwealth to provide funding for flexible care services to enable the development of innovative alternatives to standard residential or community care. For example, a flexible care funding could be used to investigate the provision of care to groups of people with special needs such as those living in not small rural and remote communities. The bill maintains funding for unlimited hospital leave for both nursing home and hostel residents and provides for 52 days of paid social leave each year. For nursing home this is an extra 24 days of social leave each year. This legislation also increases choice available to people by maintaining aged the exempt homes scheme which provides a higher level of services and accommodation for residents who pay an additional charge and also extends it to apply to hostels. These extra service arrangements can now be offered in distinct parts of facilities-for example, a not be counwing of a building. Improved Administration The bill makes explicit how personal information is to be protected. It sets out improved decision.making and includes clear criteria on which decisions are to be made, time frames for making decisions and the requirement for providing reasons for decisions. A person may seek a review of a decision by the department and then by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. To assist this process, the bill clearly sets out the decisions that are reviewable. NA As I have outlined, this legislation will implement significant changes to the way aged care services are provided. While this reform is urgently needed, the government acknowledges it would be irresponsible to allow the system to develop unchecked after the passage of the bill. The government is therefore committed to evaluating the effectiveness of the reforms in achieving high quality care outcomes for older people within two years of the implementation of the package. The process will be undertaken in partnership with consumers and industry to continue the cooperative and beneficial relationship that has resulted during the development of this package of reforms. In addition, I am committed to ensuring we target the areas of highest need for new services. I will shortly commence a review of how we allocate and target new services. NA This bill provides the framework for the future of aged care services in this country. represents the outcome of much hard work by many sectors of the industry and consumer representatives who have made significant contributions to the reforms. It strikes a balance between residents' needs and the need to ensure nursing homes and hostels are able to provide quality accommodation and services now and into the future. The bill provides incentives for excellence and encourages innovation, flexibility and creativity in service planning and delivery. We owe it to the older Australians who have contributed in many ways to Australian society to ensure the comfort and dignity that they deserve in the later years of their lives. I commend this bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. NA (No.2) 1997 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.27 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921, the tariff act, to simplify the excise treatment of stabilised crude petroleum oil, crude oil, and liquid petroleum gas, LPG. This bill is part of a legislative package which includes amendments to the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987. The provisions of sections 6B, 6C and 6D of the tariff act set out the methods of calculating the excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil, crude oil. Section 6B governs the excise duty on old oil, section 6C governs the excise duty on new oil and section 6D governs the excise duty on intermediate oil. Under each of these provisions, the amount of duty in respect of each type of crude oil is ascertained by reference to the prescribed production area from which the oil is produced and to the prescribed division of a It financial year during which the oil is entered for home consumption. Under section 6B, 'prescribed division' in relation to a financial year means one of 36 divisions in that year. Basically, there are three divisions in each month of a year and this means that the amount of excise duty on crude oil is required to be calculated 36 times per financial year. The payment of excise duty is also made 36 times per year. This method of continuous calculation and payment of excise duty on crude oil was first introduced in 1983 with the intention of ensuring the systematic collection of excise during a financial year. At that time, the production of excisable crude oil was very high, with excise collections of $4.2 billion in 1984-85 mainly from the Bass Strait region, and this method resulted in relatively even payments of excise throughout the financial year. In 1987, amendments were made to the method as a result of the deregulation of the crude oil market. The amount of excise duty payable is now based on the volume weighted average of prices realised from the sales of excisable stabilised crude Oil by Australian producers-the volware price of the crude oil. These prices are determined under the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987-the prices act-and are determined on a monthly basis. The timing of the calculation and payment of excise duty was not changed. The amount continues to be calculated and paid 36 times per financial year. As previously referred to, the present method of calculation and payment of excise duty was introduced when the production of excisable crude oil was very high. In 1990, however, the petroleum resource rent tax regime was extended to Bass Strait with the result that only three developments in the coastal waters off Western Australia and Queensland are presently subject to excise duty. In 1995-96, the amount of excise on crude oil was only $12.2 million. It is considered that, with such reduced amounts of excise duty being imposed upon crude oil, the requirement that the duty be calculated and paid 36 times during a financial year now places a disproportionate administrative burden upon crude oil producers and the government. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the tariff act to: (1) increase the length of the prescribed divisions from the current period of eight, nine, 10 or 11 days to a calendar month, thereby decreasing the number of prescribed divisions from 36 per financial year to 12 per financial year. This will mean the amount of excise duty will only be required to be calculated 12 times per year; and (2) as a consequence of this, require the payment of excise duty 12 times per year in place of 36 times per year. These amendments require consequential amendments to the calculation of vol ware prices under the prices act. As the calculation and payment of excise duty are based around the financial year, it is proposed that the amendments to both the tariff act and the prices act will commence on 1 July 1997 to avoid any difficulties that may arise from the overlap of the two different timing arrangements during a financial year. The proposed amendments to the tariff act and the prices act have been developed after consultation with the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. This bill also amends the tariff act by removing LPG from the ambit of the tariff act. At present, LPG produced from offshore fields that came into production after 17 August 1977 is excisable under subitem 17(C) of the schedule. The rate of excise on LPG is 'free'. With the extension of the resource rent tax regime to Bass Strait in 1990, however, the only offshore fields that are subject to the excise regime are those on the North West Shelf. LPG is being produced on the North West Shelf and is excise free. LPG produced from onshore fields is excise exempt. It is therefore proposed to make the production of LPG excise exempt by removing LPG from the ambit of the tariff act. This will remove the unnecessary administrative burden on producers of LPG and the government and will bring the treatment of offshore LPG production in line with the onshore LPG production. The bill also proposes decreases in the rates of excise duty on aviation gasoline-avgasand aviation kerosene-avtur-of 0.75c per litre with effect from 1 September 1996. The decreases in the excise duty on avgas and avtur were the result of the overcollection of excise duty on these products during 1995-96. The reductions also take account of the reduction in the operating costs of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and forecast growth in airline activity which will lead to increases in consumption of aviation fuels. The decreases were proposed in Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 of 1996, which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 16 September 1996 and took effect on 1 September 1996. The proposed amendments, including their financial impact, are outlined in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum. I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguson) adjourned. PETROLEUM EXCISE (PRICES) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.36 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 to simplify the crude oil excise calculation and collection regime. Industry supports these changes. The Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 allows for the determination, by the Minister for Resources and Energy, of the volume weighted average of realised-vol wareprices for each excisable crude oil producing region each month; this is the price for excise purposes. Since the deregulation of the oil industry 1988 the petroleum secondary taxation regime has altered considerably. At that time, the Bass Strait oil producing region was the only excisable crude oil producing region in Australia. In 1990 the PRRT replaced the excise regime in Bass Strait and PRRT applied to all offshore regions except the North West Shelf project area. However, Commonwealth excise continued to apply in state and territory waters onshore and to the North West Shelf. The fields which are currently subject to excise are: the Jackson field in south-west Queensland and the Saladin and the Harriet-Lenita fields in Western Australian coastal waters. These three fields cantly smaller crude oil producers than the Bass Strait region, with sales directly to ship compared to Bass Strait where pipeline sales were continuous. During 1997-98 the Wanaea field in the North West Shelf ed to become excisable. Currently, excise is collected thrice monthly with payment of excise occurring before the producers receive payment for the oil sold. To compensate for this early payment of excise, the vol ware price calculation allows a compensation factor called 'credit terms compensation' for part of the time difference between excise payment and receipt of payment. The act also imposes the obligation to determine vol ware prices for oil producing regions even though their production rate is below the level at which excise liability occurs. These prices exist in three forms: a reference price for the month ahead; an interim volware price for the month immediately past; and a final volware price when all transaction data is complete. Depending on the date of discovery, the rate at which excise is levied is based on progressive production tranches with some annual production being excisable at a zero rate. This bill removes the necessity to determine vol ware prices for oil producing regions whose annual production is below the first excisable tranche, leading to administrative savings for industry and government. If the annualised production increases to 80 per cent of the first excise tranche the determination of vol ware prices could be reintroduced. This bill, together with the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997, which are in presented together as a legislative package, will change the excise collection regime from three times each calendar month to monthly, therefore negating the requirement for the determination of a reference price. In order to maintain revenue neutrality, the IS-day credit terms compensation period will need to be changed to 30 days. The method of calculation is laid down in the petroleum excise (prices) regulations and its amendment is dependent on passage of these amendment bills. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin Ferguare signifi- son) adjourned. NA  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (5.41 region is expect- p.m.)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposal No.2 (1997) On 4 March 1997, my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) announced that the recommendations of the Joint Industry and Government Sugar Industry Review Working Party had been accepted by the Commonwealth government. These recommendations provide an integral package of reforms designed to promote a sustainable and internationally competitive sugar industry. The recommendations have also been endorsed by the Queensland government and have the unanimous support of industry leaders on the working party. The Commonwealth government is mindful of the fact that the support of the industry groups was dependent on the integrated package they had proposed to government being implemented in full. In the circumstances, the working party's recommendations were accepted by the Commonwealth government. The working party has recommended the removal of the customs rate of duty of $55 per tonne from sugar and certain sugar by-products. Over 90 per cent of sugar produced in Australia is exported. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 2 (1997), which I have just tabled, implements that recommendation by removing the customs duty from sugar, molasses and treacle with effect from 1 July 1997. A summary of the alterations contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House.

VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND SIMPLIFICATION MEASURES) BILL First Reading Bill presented by Mr Bruce Scott, and read a first time. Second Reading",144
216,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill completes the amendments to legislation that are needed to give effect to the government's 1996-97 budget for Veterans' Affairs. This bill integrates into the Department of Social Security's family payments the child related payments made to Veterans' Affairs' income support recipients. From 1 January 1998, payees will have to deal with only one Commonwealth department to establish their entitlement to child related payments, as a result of the changes proposed in this bill. It makes good sense to this government to ensure that people who are receiving various means of income support have to deal with only one department, as far as this is practical. The integration of these child related payments will not reduce the total amount of Commonwealth payments made to the family unit. Where a financial loss may occur, the payments will not be integrated. In these cases, while the payees are eligible to receive more than they could receive from the family payment, the child related payments will continue to be made by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. One of the government's pre-election commitments to the veteran community was a 'plain English' version of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I am pleased this bill introduces the first instalment of legislative change towards that goal. The Veterans' Entitlements Act currently has six separate rate calculators, with nine separate method statements, to calculate the overall income support rate. This bill tackles the duplication and complexity of the rate calculators by replacing them with a single rate calculator that uses just six rate calculation processes, if you understand that. Mr Martin Ferguson-But do you? 1997 Mr Bruce SCOTT-That is why we are simplifying it. In effecting this reform, there will be some changes to correct minor technical deficiencies in some parts of the rate calculators. These changes will have no adverse financial impact on any income support pensioner or payee. This bill demonstrates that legislation, which delivers a wide range of compensation and income support benefits to a large disparate group of people, need not be complex and inaccessible. The changes in this bill are positive reinforcements of this government's commitment to improved public administration through more efficient service delivery and through simplified rules that are easily understood by veterans and the wider community. I have spoken to the shadow minister. I am just going to say, before commending the bill to the House, that as today is the last parliamentary sitting day before Australia's national day of commemoration-ANZAC Day on 25 April-it is important that Australians continue to honour the service and sacrifice of those who have served. I know members and senators on both sides of the parliament will be involved in their communities on ANZAC Day. I would urge members and senators to encourage people, both young and old, to participate in commemoration services in their community. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.",150

On indulgence, I join with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in urging all Australians, our young and our old, to participate in the ANZAC Day ceremonies around Australia.

218,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The Senate has made three amendments to the bill as presented. The first amendment inserts into clause 14 of the bill, which would allow the minister to notify the agency of general policies of the Commonwealth government, a requirement that the particulars of any policies notified under the provision be included in the annual report of the agency. The second amendment inserts into clause 30 of the bill, which relates to the terms and conditions of the appointment of the CEO of the agency, a requirement that in determining those terms and conditions the board of the agency consult with the Remuneration Tribunal. It also inserts a requirement that the particulars of such advice be included in the annual report of the agency. The third amendment deletes from clause 35 of the bill, which deals with the staff of the agency, the capacity of the agent to employ persons under terms and conditions determined by the board in addition to the persons employed under the Public Service Act 1922 under clause 35(1). The government opposed each of the amendments in the Senate. In the case of the first two amendments, this opposition was on the basis of the amendments being unnecessary and also on the fact that the provisions a finanin question were unexceptional when compared with the provisions in similar legislation, including legislation passed while the opposition was in government in the form originally presented. The government opposed the third amendment because the subclause in question would provide the agency with flexibility in relation to the employment of additional staff-that is, the staff in addition to those employed under the Public Service Act. The government also pointed out that, as with the first two amendments, the clause was unexceptional in its original form. Once again, the government pointed out several examples of similar provisions that were passed into law while the opposition was in government. The government does not resile from its views in relation to the amendments. However, the government is most anxious that the passage of this important legislation is not denied and that this very important initiative, which will provide significant benefits to the community, is progressed as soon as possible. As a result, the government will not be opposing the amendments here today.",151
219,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,COMMONWEALTH SERVICES,"As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) says, the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill 1996 has been returned to this House following the passage of three amendments in the Senate put forward by the opposition. The first of these amendments is to clause 14. It requires that any notification by the minister to the board of general policies of the Commonwealth government that are to apply in relation to the agency, the board or the employees must be included in the annual report for the agency each year. This amendment, from our point of view, is essential to ensure public accountability for any government policy directives which might be made to the agency. The second amendment is to clause 30. This amendment first of all requires that the board of the agency must not make a determination in relation to the terms and conditions, including remuneration and allowances on which the Chief Executive Officer for the agency is to hold office, before it has obtained advice from the Remuneration Tribunal. This part of the amendment is very important to help prevent the salary and conditions of the Chief Executive Officer of the new agency, which is supposed to look after the most disadvantaged people in our society, from being paid exorbitant and inequitable wages and conditions of employment, an issue that I raised in the debate prior to the bill being referred to the Senate. The second part of the amendment to clause 30 put forward by the opposition and passed by the Senate requires the details of any advice obtained from the Remuneration Tribunal to be included in the annual report for the agency each year. This will ensure that there is proper public scrutiny of the terms and conditions of employment of the Chief Executive Officer of the new agency, something I am sure that she supports. The third amendment put forward by the opposition and passed by the Senate changes clause 35. This amendment deletes the original bill's intention to employ persons on terms and conditions outside the Public Service Act as originally intended by the government. This amendment put forward by the opposition was extremely important to protect the principle of equal pay for equal work, something that I know is not of the utmost importance to the government, especially the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service (Mr Reith). Given that the government has now accepted these amendments, the opposition does not oppose passage of the amended bill. We are pleased that we have achieved significant changes to the original bill to ensure that the new agency is fairer, more equitable and accountable than would otherwise have been the case if the government of the day had had its way. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",152
220,Mr RUDDOCK,DELIVERY AGENCY,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill contains amendments that are consequential on the creation of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, which is to be established by the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Bill 1996, which was introduced in this House on 4 December 1996. As I said in my second reading speech on the agency bill, the establishment of the agency will implement a major change in service delivery arrangements for the Commonwealth. It will provide an administrative framework for the integration of access to Commonwealth services so that, where possible, people can get the help they need in one place. This bill makes minor, technical amendments to give effect to that administrative framework. In particular, it proposes amendments that reflect the fact that, once the agency bill has been passed by the parliament, various functions concurrently undertaken by the Secretary to the Department of Social Security and by the department itself will be able to be delegated to the chief executive officer-the CEO-of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency and to officers of that agency. This means that the various Commonwealth acts need to be amended to reflect the fact that certain functions of the secretary and the department may be carried out by the CEO or the agency. I commend the bill to the House. I table an explanatory memorandum. Leave granted for second reading debate to proceed forthwith.",153
221,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,DELIVERY AGENCY,"The Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 makes necessary amendments to various pieces of legislation to facilitate the establishment of the new agency. From the opposition's point of view, we believe that these amendments are essentially technical in nature and, therefore, we will not oppose this bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Ruddock) read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.1) 1997 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendments(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 4 (after line 25), after subsection (3), insert: (3A) In deciding whether to make a determination under subsection (3), the Secretary is to have regard to the following matters (except to the extent, if any, to which the matters concerned relate to the safety of air navigation): (a) the public interest, including but not limited to: (i) the need of people to travel on, or to send cargo and mail by, aircraft; and (ii) the promotion of trade and tourism to and from Australia; and (iii) if the application relates to a program of flights to or from Australia-whether there is to be a wide range of places in Australia that will be served under the program; and (iv) if foreign interests hold substantial ownership and effective control of a charterer or a charter operator--employment and investment in, and general development of, the Australian Aviation industry; and (v) aviation security; and (vi) Australia's international relations; (b) the availability of capacity (within the meaning of the International Air Services Commission Act 1992) on scheduled international air services, and any relevant determination made by the International Air Services Commission in respect of the allocation of capacity on those services; (c) any relevant advice on matters referred to in paragraph (a) that is provided to the Minister by that Commission under paragraph 6(2)(c) of that Act; and (d) any other matter that the Secretary thinks relevant. (2) Schedule 1, item 2, page 8 (after line 11). after subparagraph (iii), insert: (iiia) if foreign interests hold substantial ownership and effective control of the charterer or the charter operator---employment and investment in, and general development of, the Australian Aviation industry; and",153
222,Mr RONALDSON,AVIA TION LEGIS LA TION,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (5.59 p.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I will speak briefly on the two amendments to the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997, both of which came from the opposition. The first amendment was that the secretary to the department, when determining that a category of charter flights does not require permission from the department, be required to take into account all the matters considered in the approval process. After further consideration and discussions with the opposition, the government has agreed to this amendment. While the setting out of all the criteria again in the act seems a little administratively cumbersome, the government understands that the opposition's wish is to have transparency in reaffirming the factors a secretary would take into account in deciding to give exemptions to certain categories of charter flights. In that regard, I would also remind the House that section 15A subsection (7) does now provide that any determination by the secretary in relation to a category of commercial non-scheduled flights is a disallow able instrument and, as a result, subject to full parliamentary scrutiny. It is important that the T louse realise that. Therefore, the reasons uehind any such proposed determination will be fully established and tabled in parliament for consideration and possible disallowance before they come in effect. In relation to the second amendment, which is that, in considering whether to approve charter flights, the secretary be required to have regard to an additional criteria in considering foreign charterers or charter operators-that is, the impact on employment and investment in, and general development of, the aviation industry-the government has agreed to the amendment following further clarification from the opposition as to the intent of the provision. The opposition has indicated that the secretary of the department, in deciding whether to approve a foreign charter application, consider as one of the criteria to which the secretary have regard the impact on the Australian aviation industry and our scheduled carriers. While it was noted that one of the existing criteria in the bill covers: (b) the availability of capacity ... on scheduled international air services, and any relevant determination made by the International Air Services Commission in respect of the allocation of capacity on those services;to Australian carriers, the government is happy to add that additional criteria. As the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) and I indicated during the debate on this bill in the House, what should also be recognised is that foreign charter operators do bring to Australia many overseas visitors who might not otherwise come to this country. They also operate to centres outside the major Australian international gateways. In doing so, they make an important contribution to employment and investment opportunities for the Australian tourism industry. Appropriately, one of the criteria the secretary is to have regard to-the promotion of trade and tourism-is also included in the bill. Having added those few summary points, the government accordingly agrees to the bill as amended by the Senate.",154
223,Mr TANNER,AVIA TION LEGIS LA TION,"I would like to take a couple of minutes to commend the government for agreeing to the amendments that the opposition moved to this legislation in the House and that have subsequently been dealt with in the Senate. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson) has indicated, these amendments do primarily relate to matters that concern what the secretary to the department has to take into account when making decisions with respect to granting approvals for foreign charters. Although it is true to say, as the parliamentary secretary did, that the previously existing provision in the government's legislation with respect to the International Air Services Commission did indirectly pertain to the issue of the Australian aviation industry, it is our view that a more explicit criterion was appropriate to be inserted. I am pleased that the government has agreed to that proposition; and also that the provision which empowers the secretary to exempt a particular charter operation from the requirement to get approval requires that the secretary consider the same issues when proposing to grant such an exemption as he or she would have to consider when actually granting an approval. It is extremely important for the future of the aviation industry in this country that we maintain something approximating what we have at the moment, which is a fairly good mix between substantial foreign involvement in the industry, substantial foreign competition, but with a substantial Australian share the market-somewhere over 40 per cent. Around 45 per cent is probably roughly the amount at the moment. I believe it is important that government aviation policy ensures that the Australian proportion of the market remains somewhere around that level and that we have substantial competition-as we do have-as a result of the participation of international carriers, that we at the same time sustain a significant Australian involvement both through Qantas and Ansett. I again commend the government for agreeing to the amendments. The opposition naturally supports the amendments to the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. NORTHERN TERRITORY: NA",154
224,Mr DONDAS,CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM,"by leave-I table the final draft constitution of the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory has been a self-governing territory since 1978 and territorians have always considered the Northern Territory (SelfGovernment) Act 1978 as the territory's de facto constitution. However, the result of Monday's night vote on the Euthanasia Laws Bill in the Senate reminded territorians that our self-government is based on an act of federal parliament neither adopted nor approved by the people of the territory. We were sharply reminded how vulnerable we are to Commonwealth intervention in our affairs, reminded that we have no right to protect our laws from repeal. The Northern Territory'S Chief Minister, Shane Stone, claimed that the poor result in the House of Representatives and the Senate has galvanised the push for statehood for the Northern Territory. I agree with him and I have been inundated with calls from territorians angry and surprised at the result in the Senate. These are not people who have a strong opinion on euthanasia. They are citizens of Australia, territorians who believe that they have been betrayed by members of the federal parliament. They believe that they have been treated as second-class citizens by the Senate, subject to different laws to those of their of patriots in neighbouring states. They are angry that their parliament, democratically elected by territorians, has being overridden by another parliament. They are angry that members of this parliament believe that the territory parliament is incapable of making laws for the people it represents. Territorians are concerned that this is the thin edge of the wedge. They believe that a but frightening precedent has been set for the disallowance or the repeal of more territory laws. My parliamentary colleague from the territory, Senator Grant Tambling, tabled this document in the Senate recently. It.is now more important than ever to achieve a secure legislative future for the people of the territory. On 28 August 1985, the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory of Australia by resolution established the Select Committee on Constitutional Development. The terms of reference outlined the requirements of the committee to report and make recommendations on matters connected with a constitution for the new state. This included a requirement to outline the future legislative, executive and judicial powers in a state constitution. The Northern Territory is in a unique position of being able to consider constitutional development in the context of modem Australia. The constitution includes some innovative responses to aspects of modem Australia that would interest all members of this place. The preamble of the constitution acknowledged the indigenous inhabitants of the territory and the laws and the customs that govern their society. This is the first time in Australian constitutional law that our indigenous peoples have been formally recognised in such a document. The preamble also recognises that the Northern Territory is a diverse multicultural society and stresses tolerance as a cornerstone of a democratic society. A series of rights reflecting the multicultural status of the territory are outlined in the preamble. The protection of the most important features of a multicultural society are incorporated in section 8. The tolerance of the divergence of languages, customs and religious beliefs are preserved. Part 7 of the final draft entrenches the rights of Aboriginals in the constitution, a reminder of organic law. These extend to the recognition of Aboriginal customary law and self-determination and the protection of sacred sites and land rights. However, the constitution still preserves the great traditions of the Westminster system of responsible government. This system of parliamentary accountability by the executive, I believe, is a system of democratic government without parallel. Territorians have been actively involved in the preparation for statehood since 1974. The committee is aware that an important element of statehood for the Northern Territory will be national support. I acknowkdge that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the coalition have a commitment for statehood for the Northern Territory. Statehood for the Northern Territory is about gaining constitutional equality within the Australian federation. It is about having the rights and responsibilities that citizens living in Australia currently enjoy. It is about protecting the integrity of our parliament and the democratic ideals on which it is established. I call on the coalition to take the necessary action to create the seventh state of Australia by granting the Northern Territory statehood as soon as possible. I am not asking the coalition to fast-track this request, it is an issue that has been going on for 23 years. Of those 23 years, 19 have been self-governing. We cannot afford another disastrous assault such as the Andrews bill on the rights of territorians.",155
225,Mr LEO MCLEAY,CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM,"Watson) (6.09 p.m.}As the Deputy Manager of Government Business, I find it a rather strange arrangement that a member comes in here and tables a document which is a report of a sessional committee on constitutional development of another parliament. I do not know whether, by the government allowing him to do this, it is the government's giving its imprimatur to what is in this report or not. Mr Dondas-It was tabled in the Senate.",156
226,Mr LEO MCLEAY,CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM,"Whether it was tabled in the Senate or not means nothing. Whether it means the government is giving this its support or not, I do not know. The government does not seem to know that either. The opposition is of the belief that, if the government is going to come in here and do these things, suitable notice should be given to the opposition spokesperson and the opposition spokesperson should have the same right to respond. If the government thinks that on the last day of the session we are going to come in here and have these sorts of dry gulches, then we can sit tonight, tomorrow and the rest of the week, if you want to. If there are going to be agreements between the government and the opposition about how we can progress the business of today, there has got to be a bit of honesty. If we are going to be honest, we should not just do these things off the cuff. A number of my colleagues may have wished to have spoken on this matter, I do not know. They would have never heard of this until now, and they would have only heard of it now if they were listening-which I doubt. I am interested to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson) has to say on this. Indeed, I would expect that, if the government is going to be fair about this, it might want to move that the House take note of the paper. If the opposition spokesperson wants to come in here later this evening and respond-I do not know whether he does or not-that is the only fair way this can be done. Otherwise, we could find that all the bets for tonight are off.",156
227,Mr RONALDSON,CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (6.12 p.m.)-On indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker: I hear what the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) is saying. My understanding was that the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) had approached the shadow minister at the table, the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), and explained to him that he was going to seek leave to table this report. I was asked for my consent for it to be tabled and for a short statement to be made. I assumed that had been the situation communicated to the shadow minister. I cannot speak for him in relation to this matter, but I assumed that was what was said. The government is doing no more than allowing the member for the Northern Territory to table this paper and make a short statement. The member for Watson need not read any more into it than that, but I take cognisance of what he said in relation to the matter. I do not think there is a hijack involved here. My understanding was that it would be tabling and a short statement-no more, no less. If it is the wish of the member for Watson that we move a motion to take note of the paper, I cannot see there is any problem with that, quite frankly. I am happy to do so.",157
228,Mr LEO MCLEAY,CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM,"Watson) (6.13 p.m.)On indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker: I would seek two things, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson) might seek advice from up there in the comer. This has just come in here tonight. The member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) just came in here and made a short statement on a paper we knew nothing about. It was tabled in here without any notice to us or the shadow minister. If the government wants to run arrangements now by slipping in here and walking up to whomever is at the table and saying, 'By the way, do you mind if we do this now?' they should know that is not the way we run business here. I am quite happy for the government to move that the House take note of the paper, but I want to know whether the government would be willing to allow the shadow minister to make a response later tonight of about the same time as the member for the Northern Territory. The shadow minister may wish to say nothing, but I do not think we should not give him the chance, if he wants to, to speak for about the same time as the member for the Northern Territory. So if the government is agreeable to that, it could move that the House take note of the paper, and I will check whether we want to bring it back later tonight.",157
229,Mr RONALDSON,CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (6.14 p.m.)-Again, on indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker: my understanding and the government's understanding was that the member involved could do as he did today subject to leave being granted by the shadow minister at the table. I cannot take it any further. I am not really too sure whether the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) means the shadow minister at the table orMr Leo MCLeay-No, the relevant shadow minister.",157

231,Mr RONALDSON,CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM,"I am happy to move that we take note of the paper. The government is not in any way trying to ambush the opposition with this. As the duty minister, I assumed that the discussions had taken place between the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) and the shadow minister.

I move: That the House take note of the paper. Debate (on motion by Mr Leo MCLeay) adjourned. NA BILL (No.3) 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",157
232,Mr MILES,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.16 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. CGT exemption: disposal of small business assets on retirement The bill implements the government's election commitment to allow small business taxpayers to claim an exemption from tax on capital gains made on the disposal of some or all of their active business assets if the ceeds are used for retirement. The CGT retirement exemption will be welcomed by thousands of small business operators. Owners of small businesses often need to reinvest earnings into their business to sustain growth and increase profitability. These individuals are sometimes not ly able to contribute to superannuation on a regular or even occasional basis. This measure offers a way in which those individuals can place accumulated capital gains into the superannuation environment without making regular contributions. Taxpayers eligible for the CGT retirement exemption are individuals conducting business as sole traders or in partnership, and companies and trusts where there is a controlling individual who is also an employee of the company or trust. Principal residence exemption from CGT The Treasurer (Mr Costello), in the 1996-97 budget, announced measures to extend the principal residence exemption to assist home owners, and beneficiaries and trustees of deceased estates. The bill will extend the qualifying period for the capital gains tax exemption on disposal of an inherited house from 12 months to two years. This will assist many trustees and beneficiaries of deceased estates by giving them more time to dispose of the deceased's principal residence. The bill will provide a partial CGT exemption for trustees and beneficiaries of deceased estates where the deceased never used the dwelling as a principal residence but beneficiaries of the estate do so. The provisions will also treat a beneficiary or trustee who acquires a dwelling as a result of a death as having acquired the dwelling at its market value on the date of death if it was wholly the principal residence of the deceased at the time of death. Also, where a person's principal residence is first used for income producing purposes, its market value at that date will be used as its cost base. The amendments recognise that taxpayers often experience record keeping and compliance problems when disposing of a dwelling prothat has been used for income producing purposes, either for part of the period of ownership or during a period prior to inheritance. The amendments will ensure that taxpayers do not need to Keep records of costs incurred before a principal residence is first used for income producing purposes or inherited by them. This will simplify the tax treatfinancial- ment in the majority of cases. Subsidiary company liquidations and capital gains tax The bill amends the capital gains tax provisions of the act to reduce a capital gain or loss otherwise realised on the cancellation of shares on the dissolution of a company which is the wholly owned subsidiary of another company. The provisions apply where consideration for the disposal of the shares is equal to the market value of assets distributed in specie to the shareholder company by the liquidator as part of a final distribution. This measure will ensure that duplication of gains or losses will be avoided as far as possible in these cases. Gains and losses The bill proposes several amendments to the income tax law in relation to capital and revenue losses. These measures were announced in the 1996-97 budget. The amendments include provisions relating to the offset of current year capital losses, the correction of anomalies in the loss and bad debt provisions relating to companies, the insertion of safeguards in the same business test contained in the capital loss provisions, and the tax treatment of payments made in consideration for the transfer of capital and revenue losses. In addition to these previously announced amendments, the bill proposes to amend the capital loss transfer provisions to give the Commissioner of Taxation unlimited time to amend the assessment of a transferee company in certain circumstances. The commissioner already has this power in relation to the analogous revenue loss transfer provisions. Depreciation of lessor's fixtures Another measure in the bill will ensure that a lessor of depreciable plant or articles under a chattels lease is treated as the owner for taxation depreciation purposes where that leased equipment has become a fixture on another person's land. Generally, only the owner of the land is the owner of any fixtures on the land, including plant and equipment that may be leased. Technically, that means a lessor may not be entitled to depreciation in respect of leased plant that becomes a fixture on another person's land. The amendment will result in a more consistent treatment of taxation depreciation allowances for capital expenditure on leased plant. Treatment of payments made under the firearms surrender arrangements The bill will implement the announcement made by the Treasurer on 24 July 1996 concerning the tax treatment of payments made under the Compensation for the Surrender of Prohibited Firearms Guidelines issued by the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board. These guidelines were issued as a result of the meeting of state and territory police ministers regarding uniform gun laws held on 10 May 1996. The amendments will ensure that no income or capital gains tax will be paid in respect of the compensation payments received under the arrangements by taxpayers who are not gun dealers and who used prohibited firearms either in their business or for private purposes. The amendments will provide two outcomes for gun dealers. They will ensure that there will be no taxable income in relation to a prohibited firearm during the income years when it was held as trading stock. They will also exempt from tax compensation payments received for the loss of business caused by the prohibition of certain firearms. Research and development On 13 December 1996, the Treasurer announced that the government would move amendments to the R&D tax concession to ensure that companies in partnership could not re-create undesirable syndicate like features. To that end, the bill ensures that limits on core technology deductions that came into effect on 23 July 1996 will apply to companies in partnership in the same way as to other companies. One of the worse aspects of syndicated R&D related to the immediate deduction of expenditure on overvalued core technology. The bill also authorises disallowance of deductions of R&D syndicates, where an extension of the syndication period has been granted but the syndicate has breached a condition of that extension. Increase in age limit for superannuation contributions This measure will increase to 70 years the threshold from which employers are no longer required to provide superannuation support for their employees. This is consistent with the government's election commitment to allow people over age 65 to continue contributing to a regulated superannuation fund or retirement savings account, RSA, where they maintain a bona fide link with the paid work force. Rebate for superannuation contributions made on behalf of a low-income or nonworking spouse The bill implements the government's election commitment to provide a rebate to a person who contributes to superannuation on behalf of a low income or non-working spouse. To be eligible for the rebate, the spouse's assessable income must be less than $13,800. The rebate is calculated as 18 per cent of contributions, up to a maximum of $3,000 in contributions. This limit is reduced where the spouse's assessable income exceeds $10,800. Family tax initiative The bill will adjust the calculation of family tax assistance for taxpayers with exempt foreign earnings so that they will recei ve the proper amount of benefit. The method of calculation will be consistent with that for taxpayers who pay tax at a single rate for every dollar of taxable income. Remote area housing The bill will also give effect to the 1996-97 budget announcement that certain remote area housing fringe benefits provided by primary producers will be exempt from fringe benefits tax. Further, the amendments will ensure that, where a primary producer provides free or subsidised residential fuel for use in connection with housing covered by the proposed exemption, the resulting fringe benefit for remote area residential fuel will continue to receive concessional treatment. Sales tax The full Federal Court in Telstra Corporation Ltd v. FCT held that certain items used in Telstra's telephone exchanges were exempt from sales tax as electrical fittings. The government considers that this decision goes beyond the intended coverage of the exemption for electrical fittings and therefore poses a threat to the existing coverage of the wholesale sales tax system. Accordingly, the Treasurer announced in November 1996 the government's decision to amend the wholesale sales tax to ensure that goods used in the provision of telecommunication or audiovisual services cannot be, from that date, exempt from WST. These amendments will preserve the integrity of the existing tax base. Dividend imputation for tax exempt entities The amendments will cancel the franking surpluses of taxable companies that cease to be wholly owned by tax exempt entities. This will prevent the new owners availing themselves of franking surpluses accumulated during the period when the company was wholly owned by tax exempt entities. Sale of mining rights The bill will also make some technical corrections to the Senate's amendment of 12 December 1996 in relation to the exemption available for income derived from the sale, transfer or assignment of mining rights. The corrections will ensure that the Senate's amendment will be given its intended effect. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Martyn Evans) adjourned. NA BILL (No.1) 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",158
233,Mr MILES,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.29 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill will amend some aspects of the taxation laws in relation to family tax assistance. The changes are technical in nature, to ensure that family tax assistance is properly delivered to the people who are intended to benefit from the measures. The amendments will correct some anomalies in the way the law currently works. Firstly, taxpayers with primary production income and a special income component, such as a capital gain, will be able to reduce the rate of complementary tax-if any-by an amount representing family tax assistance, in circumstances where family tax assistance benefits exceed the ordinary tax liability. This will put these taxpayers in the same position as other taxpayers who are liable to pay complementary tax. Secondly, in the existing law, entitlement to family tax assistance increases the rate of further tax on uncontrolled partnership income. The law will be amended to ensure this is no longer the case. Thirdly, the complementary tax provisions in relation to family tax assistance will be adjusted for taxpayers with reduced tax-free thresholds-such as new residents and full time students entering the work force for the first time. Currently, these taxpayers are disadvantaged because the provisions are based on the normal tax-free threshold of $5,400. The bill also contains a number of technical corrections. These amendments will apply from 1 January 1997. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Martyn Evans) adjourned.

234,Mr MILES,AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.32 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of an exchange of notes amending the comprehensive double taxation agreement between Australia and Vietnam. The bill will insert the text of the notes into the International Tax Agreement Act 1953 as a schedule to that act. The exchange of notes with Vietnam took place on 22 November 1996. The notes give effect to Australia's undertaking in 1992, at the time the double taxation agreement with Vietnam was signed, that Australia would grant tax sparing for specified Vietnamese tax concessions. Tax sparing describes the situation under which Vietnam offers tax concessions to attract foreign investment. Under the proposed tax sparing credit arrangements, an Australian investor taking advantage of specified tax concessions is deemed to have paid the tax actually forgone by Vietnam for the purposes of Australia's foreign tax credit rules. Without tax sparing credits, Vietnamese tax concessions granted to Australian residents could be negated by Australia's foreign tax credit rules, which would effectively 'top up' Vietnamese taxes paid to the level of tax that would be payable on an equivalent amount of Australian domestic income. To qualify for tax sparing under these notes, three tests must be met. First, the activity must qualify for a tax concession under a Vietnamese law specified in the notes. Secondly, the incentive must be for a specified activity, targeted to genuine economic development and active business income, which is listed in the notes. A third test excludes certain activities and arrangements from tax sparing and a general anti-avoidance provision is also included. A benchmark rate of 20 per cent has been set to determine the Vietnamese tax otherwise payable. This is because at the time the notes were negotiated a variety of nominal tax rates were applicable to foreign investors - n Vietnam ranging from 25 per cent down to 10 per cent. Consequently, it was essential to establish an underlying tax rate to act as a benchmark to calculate the amount of tax forgone by Vietnam under a relevant tax concession. As is customary in Australian tax sparing arrangements, the tax sparing benefit is provided to Australian residents for a limited period of 10 years commencing from the date of effect of the 1992 Agreement-that is, from the commencement of the year of income that began on 1 July 1993. There is provision for a subsequent extension of this period. Provision is also to be made for amendment of assessments made before the notes enter into force. The notes will enter into force when further borrowings. diplomatic notes are exchanged advising that the necessary constitutional processes to give the agreement the force of law in Australia have been completed. The finalisation of the tabling processes related to taking binding treaty action and the enactment of this bill will complete the processes required of Australia for those purposes. It is not possible to accurately predict eventual effect of these notes on the revenue, but it is not expected to be significant. The government believes that this exchange of notes will contribute positively to the strengapplications thening of trade, investment and wider relationships between Australia and Vietnam. I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Martyn Evans) adjourned. NA (INFRASTRUCTURE BORROWINGS) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",161
235,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.37 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The infrastructure borrowings tax concession was first introduced by the previous government as part of their 1992 One Nation statement. It was extended in the 1994 Working Nation statement. The intention of the infrastructure borrowings tax concession was to allow companies reduced costs of borrowing to finance the construction of infrastructure projects. This was achieved by the borrower forgoing deductions for the cost of the borrowing, such as interest, and the lender being exempt from tax in respect of gains from borrowing, such as corresponding interest income, or eligible for a tax rebate of 36 per cent. The intention was for lenders to pass these benefits back to the project via a lower interest rate on the To be eligible to use the infrastructure borrowing tax concession, an infrastructure project must be certified by the Development Allowance Authority. In the period between 1994 and 30 June 1996, the Development Allowance Authority issued certificates for 12 infrastructure borrowing projects with a total borrowing of $4 billion. At 30 June 1996, it the also had six applications on hand with total borrowings of at least $2.6 billion. Over the six weeks prior to the 1996-97 budget, the Development Allowance Authority received for a further 71 projects with estimated borrowings of around $21.6 billion. If all these applications were certified, the revenue cost over the period 1996-97 to 199899 has been estimated to exceed $4 billion. Because of tax aggressive financing arrangements intended to be implemented in association with some of these applications, much of the revenue lost would be captured by financiers and high marginal tax rate investors rather than the intended recipients, the infrastructure projects themselves. Against that background, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced on 14 February 1997 the cessation of the infrastructure borrowing tax concession. The bill contains amendments to the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 that are necessary to wind up the concession. The bill prevents the Development Allowance Authority from issuing any certificates to infrastructure projects after 12 p.m. on 14 February 1997. However, where an infrastructure project had received, prior to that time, advice from the Development Allowance Authority that it would be issued with a certificate subject to specified undertakings, the Development Allowance Authority will be permitted to issue a certificate. Under the present law conditions on existing certificates can be varied; however, a variation after 12 p.m. on the 14 February 1997 will not be permitted where the Commissioner of Taxation determines that the variation is likely to cause an increased cost to the revenue. The bill will not otherwise affect already issued certificates continuing and operating unchanged. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in an explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House and present a copy of the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Dr Theophanous) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (WORK FOR THE DOLE) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",162
236,Mrs CROSIO,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Prospect) (6.41 p.m.)Before question time. I was explaining to the House through my input on this Social Securiwork ty Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill how the Prime Minister (Mr Howployed ard) had guaranteed to reduce unemployment and yet all we have seen in the 12 months since he and the coalition government came to power is an increase. One of the areas must certainly upset the Prime Minister is the youth unemployment figures. Nearly 20,000 more young people have come onto the dole queue since he took over as Prime Minister 12 months ago. The Prime Minister made all the grand statements. He pinned the reputation of his government on the reduction of youth unemployment and now what have we seen? It has only grown. What was that comment that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) made? She said: If we don't get unemployment down we won't re-elected. We in the opposition will not forget that statement in a long time. So what does the Prime Minister really give us or, more specifitrials. cally, what does he give the people of western Sydney for whom he said he would go into bat so hard? Is it improved labour market schemes, increased public spending, support to small businesses through increased research and development grants? No, none of that. Instead he gives them work for the dole. Tar everybody. Instead of saying, as a leader should, 'There aren't enough jobs, let's create them.' he says 'There are too many unemployed, let's make them pay for the privilege.' Where is the logic in this? Work for the dole offers the unemployed of Fairfield, particularly the young unemployed, precious little other than a strong arm from the government and a couple of hours each week pulling weeds at one of the local parks. Is that what the Prime Minister meant when he talked about providing real jobs for young people? I have a number of problems with the work for the dole scheme particularly as they relate to my electorate of Prospect. Firstly, let me focus on the compulsive aspect of work for the dole. Why is it that the young people in my electorate, those chosen to take part in this pilot scheme, are going to be forced to for their unemployment benefits while other young kids who may have been unemfor an equal, if not longer, period of time but who live in parts of Sydney not affected by such crippling youth unemployment rates get off scott free? Why, if the pilot that programs have been as warmly welcomed in areas like mine as the Prime Minister says, is there need for compulsion at all? If it is as popular as the Prime Minister would have us believe, I would think that the few positions I expect will be offered to young people in the Fairfield-Liverpool region would be snapped up immediately. Why the need to twist the arms of the young unemployed in my community simply because of our high unemployment rate-a rate which this government has only added to? Why, while it does not insist on such compulsion in other areas or does not even offer young people in other areas an opportunity to take part in this get scheme? This is not only unfair; it smacks of prejudice and social division. If compulsion is the way this government wants to head, it should do away with the pilot scheme and the It has enough experience from Working Nation to know what does not work and what does. Do not just limit it to the young. Take it to the long-term unemployed of all ages from all parts of Australia. Be fair about it. Do not just tar the young people in my community with the work for the dole brush. What are the trallllllg aspects of the scheme? The Howard government cut $1.8 billion from the labour market programs set up by the former government to provide job training for the long-term unemployed. One hundred and seventeen thousand young people have been axed from places in these schemes. In their place we get work for the dole which the responsible minister says, and I quote again, 'is not really a solution' to our unemployment problems and provides no training for fields where jobs are likely to be found. Where is the training component of the legislation? If people are going to be maintaining and improving community facilities, if they are going to be involved in developing new pieces of infrastructure, if they are going to be taking part in home maintenance and care for the elderly, who will train them? How much has the government set aside not only for hiring training staff but also for providing equipment and logistical support? Over 500,000 people took part in Working Nation's labour programs in 1994-95, over 650,000 took part in 1995-96, and yet this government wants to blow its trumpet about 10,000 people taking part in a meagre 70 programs across the country. Working Nation perhaps had its shortcomings and, yes, it was expensive but, as the editorial in the Australian made clear on 12 March, 'It did make a real difference.' The only differences which will spring from work for the dole will be cosmetic and those will fade away as the scheme progresses and the shortcomings become clear. The government seems unable to, or refuses to, face up to the one great truth about labour market programs and job relief for the unemployed: assisting the unemployed is costly; not assisting them is more so. Yes, it costs money to provide appropriate case management for the long-term unemployed; it costs money to provide them with training and with adequate supervision; it costs money to provide people with appropriate levels of financial support for workers compensation, superannuation and occupational safety. The work for the dole scheme will either ignore or fail to effectively cover these issues as long as the government insists that labour market strategies are not worthy of solid Commonwealth financial support. You cannot skimp on labour market programs, you cannot skimp on the unemployed. If you do, you sew into the fabric of our society far greater problems in the long term. You guarantee that the social dislocation-the violence, the drug dependency, the crime, the family breakdowns which are occurring now in my electorate at a level far greater than ever before-will soon spread to the mansions and the quiet cul-de-sacs of Kirribilli and Wollstonecraft. The Prime Minister's work for the dole scheme should have the word 'skimp' inserted somewhere in its title. It is a cheap diversion, an attempt to distract mainstream Australia from the fact that those who will be forced to take part in it are still without a job-because that is really the bottom line. Whether people work for the dole or not, the unemployed of Fairfield, Villawood, Smithfield, Bossley Park, Prairiewood, Horsley Park, Greystanes-just to name a few of the suburbs that make up my electorate-are still unemployed. The Prime Minister and the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) should stop wasting Australia's time. Labor was on track for an unemployment rate of 5 per cent by the year 2000. By all means, reform the labour programs begun under Working Nation where you see fit, but Prime Minister, you and your government must recognise that it was largely doing the job and you must recognise that it is going to take more than a work for the dole scheme to create job opportunities for young people. The Prime Minister and his coalition government must recognise that their policies have added to unemployment in areas like mine in western Sydney and have added to the social problems and discomfort which go hand in hand with this modern scourge. They must recognise, Mr Deputy Speaker, that they have a long way to go before they will be able to live up to the fine rhetoric and grand statements they have delivered to the people of Sydney's west. The Prime Minister and his government promised my constituents real jobs: they have delivered nothing of the sort. I believe this legislation before the House is offensive. As I said at the beginning of my speech, it stigmatises the kids who have not got a job. It is unfair in that it is going to discriminate against those who are in the areas of high unemployment and, as I said earlier, my electorate possibly has the second highest unemployment rate in Australia. I believe that if the young people in my electorate had the opportunity of jobs they would take up that opportunity but, more importantly, they need job training so they will be able to fulfil their commitments in their future years. This scheme is not going to provide training. It is only going to be a cheap, cosmetic exercise. The government thinks it is a short-term solution for getting people working. But if it believes that people must work for the payment they are receiving, then let all people work for the payment, not just a few. It is not fair and it discriminates against those who are least able to defend themselves. I do not support the bill before the House.",163
237,Mr BOB BALDWIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Let me say from the outset that it is always a pleasure to listen to the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) deliver a speech. That speech, as usual, was full of passion and commitment, but unfortunately at times-and it is not quite like her-not always full of fact. She has said that the Howard government is full of fine rhetoric and grand statements, but what the Howard government is about is getting people back into jobs, and it is not easy. It is not easy, and we do not ever admit that it is easy. If it were easy, we would have the problem fixed by now. It is a long hard track. But one thing we have to remember is who put us in this parliament. I have just listened to the member for Prospect talk about the unemployment rates in her electorate being the second highest-you can correct me on that. Who put those unemployment rates there? Earlier tonight she said that we should have learnt by now what works and what does not work from Working Nation. The bottom line is that we have learnt, because there were aspects of Working Nation which did work and we are keeping those going. We have continued the funding. There is one program being run by the Hunter Valley Tourism organisation which is working. Why is it working? Because it is totally different to the normal new work opportunity programs. Mr Deputy Speaker, I bring to your attention an article that was in the Courier Mail on 11 February: Give the dole work plan a chance. And in there it says: Last week the United States President, Bill Clinton, pleaded with the American community to do something about unemployment to tum those welfare cheques into pay cheques. The Prime Minister, John Howard, has taken up this theme by proposing a work for the dole scheme to be trialled in areas of high youth unemployment. This is not radical reform; in fact it is a minnow when measured against the US end of welfare reforms and British privatisation of social security delivery. As a great American author once said, 'Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. It owes you nothing. It was here first.' If there was ever a poignant phrase which underlines the philosophy or sentiment under this legislation, then this is it. The open and frank debate of the Prime Minister's public proposal for pilot work for the dole initiatives, initiated around 9 and 10 February this year, revealed that this government is serious about the high level of unemployment-which, while it was inherited by the former government, is still far, far too high. But the bottom line is that this government is serious about doing something about it. We only have to have a look at the polls-not the LiberallLabor polls, but the polls of the reactions to the 'work for the dole' announcementand, indeed, from the radio station in the Hunter Valley, 2HD, the poll came in at over 80 per cent in support of the 'work for the dole' scheme. If we listened to the opposition, they would say, 'Well, the 20 per cent that said they didn't support it would equate to the unemployed people.' But when you listen to the people who phoned into the talkback program, a lot of those people-people wanting an opportunity, a chance, some hope and direction-were actually unemployed people and parents of unemployed people who wanted their children to have a chance; a chance that has been denied them for the last 13 years. The West Australian on Saturday, 22 February, said on page 4 that the big majority of people back the work for the dole scheme. More than three-quarters of Western Australians believe that young unemployed people should work for the dole, according to the latest west poll, and those figures are repeated all through Australia. I am sure that my colleague here the member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) would support me in those arguments-that the work for the dole bill has been outstandingly well received. If you are not content with that, then here in the ACT, in the Canberra Times on 11 February, was the headline on page 4: Young ACT people see some value in the work for the dole. It goes through and lists the names of people and what they are saying about the work for the dole scheme. What they want is an opportunity. What they want is to restore their selfesteem. They want some reason to keep going. If we listen to the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), he said on Radio National Breakfast with Pru Goward on 10 February: Are you trying to tell me that one and a half days per week is going to give people the discipline of work? They go home and they go back to bed or watch TV for the rest of the day. And then on 10 February he said: The coalition's got difficulty, so what do you do? You roll out one of these hairy chestnuts and belt the dole bludgers. That is not what the work for the dole bill is about. Belting the dole bludgers is not what this is about. It is about giving them opportunities. It is actually about improving their health. A press release put out on 10 February by the President of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Keith Woollard, states: The Prime Minister's proposed work for the dole scheme deserved full consideration and should not be dismissed out of hand. Further, it says: Unemployed young men and women are 64 per cent and 82 per cent more likely to report fair or poor health than those with work. They are also reported to have more serious chronic illnesses and are 40 per cent more likely to report symptoms of psychological distress. He also goes on to quote Dr Richard Smith, the Editor of the British Medical Journal: ... unemployment kills, ruins health and destroys family and wrote that exactly how unemployment kills is unclear, but it is through a combination of poverty, stress, adoption of unhealthy behaviours and the devastating effect on mental health. I believe that we need to protect the health of our young people. I believe that we need to make sure that we invest in their future. In this House on 17 September 1996, in a speech on the budget appropriation bill, I pointed out that $19.1 million had been dedicated for the prevention of suicide-in particular, youth suicide. I am sure that the general manager of NBN Television, Mr Jim Sullivan, and managing director Dennis Lidbury, up in the gallery, would know only too well the fine work of Father John of Commonstrength Foundation and the work that he does on youth suicide prevention in trying to get an understanding of the root of the problem. Suicide happens not because people are happy, not because they feel they have a future, but because they feel that they have nowhere left to go. I also pay credit to the work of people like or two Janelle Pearce of the Port Stephens Council and the work that she has done in the PEERS program, along with people like Jenny Megson and Bret Harris, who brought to me a whole series of poems, one of the ways that they get young people who feel absolute despair to spell out their message. As I said in that speech, I was rather distressed to read the attitudes and writing of some of the young people who are on the verge of giving up, or those who almost have and have come back. But, to look for support of the work for the dole bill, we need look no further than the Australian on 11 February 1997 on page 4. The headline said 'The States hail benefits in youth work for the dole', by Ewin Hannan and staff reporters. It said: State and Territory leaders yesterday broadly welcomed the proposed work for the dole scheme. With the New South Wales Labor government declaring it had no in-principle objections to the proposals, the New South Wales Premier, Mr Carr, said he would look sympathetically at any scheme that comes out of the federal government. So there we have an underlying support by the state government. We had some level of support from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) but in true practice and ceremony in preparation for, I believe, the Olympics in the year 2000 where, in competition with some of his colleagues, he intends to enter the flip-flop competition. Let me say that, in the flip-flop stakes, the Leader of the Opposition is far in front because he has changed his mind so many times and has done backward flips. Now we are waiting for the twin pike and the pirouette on the way through. In this chamber we have heard my colleague the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) talk regularly about the health aspects of young people who feel deserted-aspects supported by his replacement, the new President of the AMA, Dr Woollard. It is something that we need to look seriously at to make sure that we consolidate and act on that issue. The member for Prospect said that we needed to look at the new work opportunity schemes. I also heard the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) have a shot at me over my support of new work opportunity schemes. Let me say that I do not mind supporting programs that work. As I have said, the Hunter Tourism program works because it is different from most other new work opportunity programs. The Hunter Tourism program works simply because it puts young people through training and then places them with small business employers for six months. So it is the equivalent of a six-month CV, a sixmonth interview, six months of training development, six months of association building with the prospective employer. That is why it has high success rates. It has an across-the-board success rate of 51 per cent. A graduation ceremony was held earlier last month for the last course; there was a success rate on that individual course of some 81 per cent placement. I would be a fool if I did not support something that got 81 per cent of young people into jobs. It is a pity that more members on the other side do not look and listen like their former colleague, Mr David Simmons, the former tourism minister under the Keating government, who is now the head of Hunter Tourism. The opposition should wake up to the fact that this man has finally got it right. He is heading up Hunter Tourism and he has got it right-something that you could not do in all the years you were there. At all of the other new work opportunities in my electorate I go along to and at all of the graduation ceremonies, for example, which we give for council-for example, they may be cleaning up a park-I go and do the simple test. I can see the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith) sitting here grinning. We go through the presentation and I put it to the graduates. I say, 'We have cut the funding on these courses,' and-no surprise-there is no reaction. Do you want to know why there is no reaction? Because the very next question that I ask them is, 'If you have a job, put your hand up.' Guess what? Mrs Bailey-No hands.",165
238,Mr BOB BALDWIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,No hands go up. You're smart; I'll give you 10 points for that. Do you know why? Because there is absolutely no exposure to employers. Councils do not take on any more employees. I see the king of the billion dollar blow-out in training has just come inMr Crean-You were just praising the Hunter program.,167
239,Mr BOB BALDWIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,I was just praising the Hunter program and the reasonMr Crean-Why did you cut it?,167
240,Mr BOB BALDWIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,We did not cut it.,167
241,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member will make his remarks through the chair.,167
242,Mr BOB BALDWIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"In fact, we have continued to fund the Hunter Tourism program. It is still going on. We have continued to fund the $1 O- million. Why have we continued to do that? Simply, because it works. But we have not continued to fund all the other little shim-sham, flip-flop deals you have put together. Why? Because they have not worked. This is not about taking people off the dole queue to improve your unemployment figures; this is about giving people real opportunities and getting them into real jobs, not just shortterm, clean up a park programs. You can call it the painting the rocks white brigade, but you have already applied so many coats of undercoat that I am afraid it will take absolutely no more. Mr Crean-I thought he had finished. Run out of steam?",167
243,Mr BOB BALDWIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Not out of steam, just out of breath. With regard to new opportunities, and particularly those from Hunter Tourism, we have to look at some of the small businesses who are supporting these projects and who are taking people onbusinesses such as Eagle Reach Wilderness Resort, Mourners Comer and One Mile Beach caravan park. The program has over 700 graduates, with a 51 per cent conversion rate overall. But that is not very much the norm; the average net outcome in new work opportunities is just four per cent delivery-four per cent above the standard. It is an accepted view that 20 per cent of our unemployed people seeking work will obtain work without labour market assistance. We could sit back and say, 'Yes, it is money well invested. They have learnt a bit and they have been trained a bit.' But the bottom line is that over the previous six years we increased the national debt by some $70 billion. The net effect on employment has been some 7,000 people. If you do a rough calculation you will find out that that works out at about $10 million per job. That is not quite the affordable success rate that the former government might have been looking for. The opposition to the work for the dole scheme is something that surprises me because I think that, as parents, and for anyone in this place, one of the underlying reasons why we are in politics is that we want to give all young kids-particularly our own young kids-a go. That is one of the objectives we have: to do it fairly and equitably and to give people a go. Sure, there are some people in life who can buy their kids jobs and who can create companies and give their kids a false sense of security. But I think a fair dinkum Australian, one who is really thoughtful about where this country is going and where its young people are going-because it is young people who are the future of this nation-has to have one level of commitment and that is simply getting all people, but more importantly young people, into jobs. You do not get people into jobs by putting them on a training merry-go-round: today a computer course, tomorrow a bar course-as many training courses as you can pick up. Do you know who the people are who did well out of the new work opportunities? All the trainers and providers. We call them the DEET millionaires. Why? Because they were the only ones who benefited from the expenditure by Crean. You are sitting there nodding your head, but it is true and you know it is true. Mr Crean-It's not true.",168
244,Mr BOB BALDWIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It is absolutely true. You failed the people and then you do not even have the personal integrity to apologise to them. In the Sunday Age on 23 March, page 8, there is an article by Paul Daley, who says: Labor's record on jobs was not exactly clean. While Working Nation did create some real jobsand I have already recognised that todaymuch of the program introduced in the last term of Keating government as a panacea for long-term unemployment blew smoke aplenty and dazzled with mirrors. That is what you are all about. You are a circus show.",168
245,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member shall address his remarks through the chair.,168
246,Mr BOB BALDWIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The member for Hotham is nothing more than an absolute circus show. Perhaps he is the ringmaster, spending the taxpayers' dollars, or even the clown. The member for Batman, Martin Ferguson, wrote a letter to my local paper, the Port Stephens Examiner, titled 'Success of work program was Labor's'. It said: Sir, I have just read the column of Mr Bob Baldwin, the member for Paterson. It was good to see that he was praising the work of the new work opportunity graduates who work for Hunter Tourism. I hear he is boasting about the marvellous success of the program all around the Hunter Region. I hope now Mr Baldwin will join the Labor Party and ask Prime Minister Howard and the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, to re-establish the new work opportunities program which his government abolished in the last budget. The new work opportunities program involving Hunter Tourism and 700 long-term unemployed was set up under Working Nation in January 1996. When it was set up the program was predicted to have a 70 per cent success rate. Mr Baldwin is now boasting a program that beat that rate and got 80 per cent of graduates into real work. I do not have a problem with that because I have supported that individual program, the Hunter Tourism project, each and every step of the way. Just so that it is on the record, I seek leave to table a copy of that letter to the editor. Leave not granted.",168
247,Mr BOB BALDWIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Further in that paper, there was a letter to the editor right underneath it which said, 'We need programs not more slogans' by Arthur Tubman of Recluse Place, Salt Ash. He said: Local MP Bob Baldwin's Canberra comer in last week's Examiner boasted of getting Hunter youth job ready and job steady. He told of a whole 10 young local people who graduated from the working for Hunter tourism course and are still ably unemployed. I would suggest that, with these sorts of numbers, the Liberals lous slogans instead of programs. I believe that using the unemployed as cheap labour for local tourist services so they can learn how to serve a meal and polish tourists' shoes is no substitute real training. The Liberals have dismantled billions of dollars worth of the previous government's job training programs and now seem to be creating generations of fawning sycophants gaining two skills except the fixed smile and have a nice day. I fear for their future. The funny thing is that Arthur Tubman is one of those regular Labor writers who write to the paper. The Labor Party cannot even get their lines of communication right between their regular writer, Arthur Tubman of Salt Ash-and there are others, but we do not have time to go through all those. I was praising the new work opportunity for Hunter Tourism and here is this guy, one of your party members, saying, 'Hang on, it's not working.' You have no idea. Mr Crean-I know you haven't.",169
248,Mr BOB BALDWIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"No, I said you have no idea, and that is the problem, and you have not had an idea over the last 13 years that has actually worked except for the Hunter Tourism project. All the other ones have failed. They have failed everybody who has been there. Just to wrap it up, the early 20th century French writer Albert Camus once said: 'Without work, all life goes rotten.' As I have said, it is a very, very serious matter that we get young people into jobs. The opposition should come on board and support this bill rather than try to play cheap political shots. Their shots in the past were not cheap; they cost this country many millions and millions of dollars for very little return or benefit. If it is properly supported and worked through, and if the outcomes are determined to be what are critical for young people, I believe this program can succeed. (Time expired)",169
249,Mr CREAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Ijoin this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill because it gives the opportunity to indicate that the government's employment strategy is already in tatters. We saw a budget brought down last presum- year which has done two things that have impacted very heavily on the unemployed in are giving us ridicuthis country. First of all, they have cut economic growth by emasculating the programs that supported for business investment. We have seen economic growth decline to around three per cent, and the most optimistic estimates are 3% per cent for the year. We all know that, unless we get economic growth up over four per cent, we are going to have no impact at all in reducing the unemployed numbers in this country, and already the last six months have shown them to be climbing. It is not just the economic growth that has been held back in the budget; it is also the fact that they have cut the very programs that give assistance and preparation to young people in particular, but not exclusively, get them job ready so they can better for the jobs coming off the economic growth. That is the twin strategy that any sensible government must pursue. Get economic growth up because that is what creates the jobs, but prepare people so they can particirefer pate in those jobs. On the one hand, it increasing the demand for labour; on the other hand, it is increasing the supply of qualified, skilled labour. That is what the strategy to be about, but it is what this government has failed totally to do. Mrs Bailey-You sound as though you actually believe what you're saying. You created mickey mouse schemes and you know it.",169
250,Mr CREAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Since the budget, full-time .. employment, if the member for MCEwen such wants to go and look at this, has fallen 34,000 jobs. Some budget strategy! Some budget strategy for employment, Fran! The loss of 34,000 full-time jobs in the space of eight months is no mean effort. Jobs growth since the budget has averaged 6,000 per month. That is one-third of what is necessary to unemployment down to the five per cent target. Labor was on track to get unemploynumbers ment down to the five per cent level by the turn of this century. Mrs Bailey--Oh, Simon!",170
251,Mr CREAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The member falls m. doubts it because she says that, if I assert it, it has to be wrong. Let me tell you what your own minister was advised in relation to this. This is the advice to the incoming Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) from her department and to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). They say in this confidential advice: Using the assumptions, we have calculated that average annual employment growth of 2_5 per per annum would be needed to produce an unemployment rate of five per cent by the March quarter of 2001. This translates into an average annual increase in employment of about 205,000_ Labor was producing jobs at better than to do so. 205,000, but what is this government doing? It is now producing them at 70,000-oneWe third of what is needed. No wonder unemand to ployment is going up, and under these policompete cies it will continue to go up. As for the previous speaker, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), saying these programs of Working Nation had failed in getting the unemployed numbers down, let us to a report that was done by two senior is economists with the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Mr Greg Connolly and Mr David MCNicoll. has They undertook a study which established a significant link 'between spending on job programs and reducing long-term unemployment'. The same study found that labour market spending had a significant, but lagged, impact on reducing long-term unemployment, and it goes on to say: _ wage subsidies, through assistance measures as jobstart and subsidised national training wages, appear to have had an additional effect in reducing the incidence of long-term unemployed_ The fact of the matter is these are people who have judged the success of these programs, and they come out and say that programs such as these do have an impact not just in helping get people get back into employment but also in ensuring that the long-term unemployed come down. Labor did have a strategy to achieve the five per cent targetbut not this government. This is a government whose Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave up a long time ago in trying to get anywhere She near the five per cent target. In a doorstop interview in Sydney in 1991, he said, 'It's my opinion that we will never in my lifetime-and I suspect in yours-go below an unemployment level of five per cent.' What a terrible admission. This was a would be Prime Minister back in 1991 giving up on the task of getting unemployment down in this country. When I asked him the same question the other day in parliament, as to an whether he still believed it was impossible to cent get unemployment down to five per cent, Honest John refused to answer. Take that to mean that he still believes it is impossible to get it down, and he has no intention of trying What is the solution of this government? have this gimmicky bill before us today, that is one part of the solution for them. The other part of the solution is to redefine the unemployed. We now find out that anyone who works 20 hours a week is to be classified as a full-time worker. What a disgrace. This is manipulation of the figures to try to demonstrate that you are achieving what is in fact not happening. Redefining the unemployed to solve the problem-what a solution. What a dreadful effort. In addition to that, we have this gimmicky bill before us today, a bill that will compel people to work for the dole-not what they said during the election campaign. In fact, on five separate occasions they denied any intention of introducing a work for the dole scheme or a compulsory work for the dole scheme. In August 1995, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, then the shadow minister for employment, training and family services-he didn't get the cabinet post because he always had this ideological agenda to bring in the work for the dole scheme-in response to a press release that I put out that said it was their intention to introduce a compulsory work for the dole scheme, in a document headed 'Crean's lies', said: There's been no suggestion of a compulsory work for the dole scheme.' That is what you went to the election on-deceit. Now you introduce a bill into the House because you say that your polling demonstrates that there is strong support for this measure. Dr Kemp denied on two occasions that there would be a compulsory work for the dole scheme, and the Prime Minister also denied that twice. What do we have here today? Deceit personified. Go to the election, hide it from the public and then bring it into the parliament under some tawdry bill. The reality is that you cannot trust the tawdry ideologues. Dr Kemp was pursuing this agenda when he was adviser to Malcolm Fraser in the 1970s. He was the person writing the stuff about compulsory work for the dole, knocking people off benefit when 10bsback was being put together. This was the manifesto that was rejected comprehensively by the electorate in 1993. Then came the 1996 election: 'No, we're not going to do any of that. That's all behind us. We're remade people. We've learnt the error of our ways. We're not going to introduce this any more.' And what do we see? Within the space of 12 months of assuming office, this is the first wedge in the door to the reintroduction of the ideological drive. The circumstances of the announcement are also interesting. This was not a thought through proposal; this was a poll driven proposal. It was announced by the Prime Minister on a Sunday morning television interview to take the pressure off him over the Woods scandal. This is what he introduced and announced on television that Sunday morning-and with no detail. There was panic in the camp up here when media tried to find out more detail of this announcement dropped by the Prime Minister to cover himself because of embarrassment over yet another one of his ministers letting him down. Then we had the recent example where a number of the community groups expected to implement this proposal were brought into a briefing in the office of Dr Kemp, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, who has carriage of this. They will not let it near Senator Vanstone, the minister. She has already destroyed and ruined the credibility of the government in a number of areas, most noticeably in higher education and the like. They will not let her near this, but they will let Dr Kemp near it. What did he do? He had a briefing. He called the groups in, and they asked for details as to what this proposal did. Do you know what he gave them? He gave them the transcript of his appearance on one of those Sunday morning programs and two press releases. That was the only preparation available for those attending to find out what this proposal was supposed to involve. If anyone can understand what Dr Kemp talks about, they are a better person than me. Hand them a transcript of ideological drivel, and say to them, 'That's what we're going to implement' - it is no wonder these people turned around and said, 'This is a crazy proposal. We can't work it. It's not possible.' I think the most insidious thing about this is the very fact that the bill itself is headed 'Work for the Dole'. This must be the most demeaning of approaches and definitions to young people that I can imagine-that you will compel them to work for the dole. The principle of requiring people to perform, to take part in an activity, to undertake activity in return for benefits is fine. That we do not quibble with-in fact, we had that under the Working Nation proposal. It was called reciprocal obligation, and it embodied the notion of the job compact. The principle was simple: we would provide an activity to people who had been unemployed for 18 months or longer. We would guarantee that; a guaranteed job offer to anyone who had been out of work for 18 months or longer. It was not a part-time job of one or two days a week but a full-time job, a job that also included training, an activity that included case management and also the commitment to a quality training component. None of those factors appear here. What we have got is work for the dole-in other words, you work out the time that would equate to the equivalent of the dole. So if you get there in two days, you work no longer. That is the basis on which they claim that they are not breaching award conditions. There is no case management, there is no training, there is nothing full time about it and there is still no guarantee at the end. This was the criticism they used to use about our programs, but we do not see any of it there. I saw some people guffaw when I made the point a couple of weeks ago that we did have something of a work for the dole scheme but we would not call it that because it was demeaning to young people to call it that. But it is not just me who says this. Mr Fitzgerald, the Director of ACOSS, when he was asked the question on the Paul Lyneham program about why he did not support work for the dole, said: It is interesting the Prime Minister didn't we've had it for the last five or six years. He then went on to say: It was there in terms of the jobs compact which was mutual obligation of the unemployed to accept a quality training work experience. He then went on to criticise the current scheme of the government to say that what we have got now is a scheme about mutual obligation created by payment; in other words, you have to do something to get a payment, not that you have to do something to also get access to training, access to case management and access to trying to re-engage you into the work force, but simply a requirement to do something for an entitlement that already exists. The problem with this scheme is that you are offering young people no more; you are offering the same as they are getting now and expecting them to be thankful. That is what you are offering, whereas Labor, under the Working Nation program, offered them a requirement and said to them, 'We will offer you a full-time job; we will give you training; we will give you case management and if you don't take up the offer you don't get the benefit.' That is what we did, but we were giving full-time activity and we were giving training, training that equipped them for later activity and later preparedness for the job. Under Working Nation we made a real commitment. We were spending in terms of the Working Nation program on the job compactMrs Bailey-With little results.",170
252,Mr CREAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"They were not little results. You should just read that report that says there were significant results. You have a blinkered view about this. You think that if you say for long enough that there were no results you will convince yourself. The fact is that you cut $500 million out of the Working Nation programs in the last budget. What does this program cost? It costs $15 million$500 million gone and $15 million back in for a scheme that is going to cover 10,000 people at best in a year, whereas the Working Nation commitment, the job compact commitment, was an attempt to address 300,000 people over a four-year period. This was a say that massive commitment by a government that recognised that the most soul destroying aspect to a person, to their individual existence, is their inability to get a job. As a consequence, we got the long-term unemployed numbers down from 300,000 to 200,000. Since this government has been in, in fact since the budget, it has gone up another 40,000. You say our programs do not work. You've got to be joking! The fact of the matter is that unless you are prepared to commit resources you will not make an impact in terms of the long-term unemployed numbers. We never said of our programs that we could guarantee a job at the end. What we did say was that we would guarantee to improve your chances of getting one. Why? Because under our programs we were giving you experience but we were also giving you training. The simple reality is that trammg does improve a person's employability. If there is any doubt about that, look at the success rate of traineeships-84 per cent of people who undertake a traineeship get a job. What we were about was using the job compact, the new work opportunity, the first six months, to get people a start. In the old days we used to be able to get a start with unskilled jobs. The unskilled jobs now don't exist. We do have to create the environment in which people get the experience of turning up to work and also phased into training where they can understand the importance of that training to future career opportunities. Our approach was always to get them started there and then to move them on into traineeships or real job opportunities. It was not a program where we said, 'Our commitment to you stops here;' it is one where we wanted to keep that relationship going. Traineeships were one of the great successes under Working Nation. It was bagged at the time by the now Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training; he doesn't bag it now, he has embraced it and re-badged it. He calls it 'new apprenticeships'. But the fact is that a new apprenticeship is equivalent of level 3 under a traineeship. If you think there was not success in these programs, all I can say is that in 1994 there were 12,000 traineeships, in 1995 there were 23,000 and in 1996 there were 56,000, with a commitment by Nettforce to expand that again to 100,000 within the next couple of years. This is a massive increase in the commitment to traineeships in this country but only if you are prepared to put the resources there. Over the year 1995-96 the number of traineeships doubled in every month compared to that same month in the year before. But since the budget under this government that doubling has occurred only once. That shows what happens when you strip the resources away. It shows what happens when you can get a program in place that employers want and that clearly has benefits to the individual-the 84 per cent success rate. But these things work only if government is prepared to put the resources in behind them. This government is not prepared to put the resources in. It won't give a commitment to Nettforce to enable it to get on and plan that continuing growth in traineeships. I believe we have the obligation to young people in this country to provide them with a choice of education, of training or a job. Any one of those people who wants to pursue that activity should be entitled to access it, but if we are going to use labour market programs to pick up those that the system has let slip by we have got to make sure they are quality programs and we have to make sure they are universal, not mickey mouse schemes that are half-time, not mickey mouse schemes that don't provide training and certainly not mickey mouse schemes that cover only 10,000 people. By God, we have 800,000 unemployed people in this country, 240,000 of them long-term unemployed. We have got to make a commitment to them. This program is a drop in the ocean. There is a requirement to lift the game and make a real commitment to the unemployed in this country. (Time expired)",172
253,Mrs BAILEY,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I rise tonight in support of the Social Security the Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997. I must comment initially on some of the words just spoken by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). The member for Hotham can talk until he is blue in the face about how successful the Working Nation program was, but just ask the thousands of young people who went through it what the outcome was. The outcome was not a job; it was to be lined up for yet another training program. The legislation that we are debating here this evening will provide the framework for the implementation of the Howard government's work for the dole initiative. This is an initiative which has received widespread support and acclaim because of its commitment to young unemployed people. Having been left with a legacy of very high youth unemployment and nothing in place to assist those young people-other than the grossly misnamed Working Nation program where young people were merely shunted from one training program to another with little chance of gaining employment and were left with reinforced feelings of helplessness and despondency-it has been left to this government to tackle the major problem youth unemployment and its accompanying disabilities. The previous government-and we have just listened to the member for Hotham cent describe some of the programs that he was dole scheme. associated with-had 13 years to recognise the fact that many of the jobs which largely unskilled and untrained young people previously entered on leaving school have all but disappeared. Sadly, the previous government failed to recognise this fact, and-even worse-they did precious little to address problem. Their neglect of young people has resulted in today's high levels of youth unemployment and the fact that so many of our young people-and I speak to many of throughout my electorate of MCEwen-feel neglected by government. However, this government is tackling the problem of high youth unemployment in two major and, I might say, very practical ways. Firstly, through our schools vocational education programs, the national apprenticeship and traineeship system, and the numeracy and literacy strategies-all neglected by the previous government-this government is ensuring that young people leaving school to enter the work force are equipped with the appropriate skills and level of training quired to meet the demands of a rapidly changing work force. Secondly, this governof ment is providing programs which will equip young people with the opportunity to be part job hunt. of a group that actually contributes a positive outcome for a community-for example, the Green Corps program, where young people between the ages of 17 and 20 can actively participate in projects that, for example, restore degraded land through revegetation. Most importantly, young people will now have the opportunity to restore their own selfesteem and self-confidence by making a contribution to their community in return for receiving financial assistance-in unemployment benefits-through the work for the dole scheme. I was honoured to be appointed to the work for the dole task force by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). And I am pleased to be able to say that not just the young people from my of electorate of MCEwen support what this government is doing on their behalf but so too do the majority of young people throughout our nation: the Herald-Sun published the results of a poll which showed that 94.5 per of young people support the work for the Imagine just for a moment what it must feel like to be a teenager who has just finished s-hool and is looking ahead with eagerness to joining the work force and building a career. You throw yourself into the challenge of this looking for work, with all the excitement, dedication and energy you can muster. You keep a positive frame of mind. You look in the papers, send off your resume and letters application to all the jobs which attract your interest. You visit the CES every day. You ring up employers, inquiring about positions, and you send out your resume to companies you are interested in working for, thinking it only a matter of weeks until you are offered a position. Then imagine what it must feel like one or two years on when that same person is still without a job, still on the dole queue and still looking for work. That initial sparkle and determination begins to wane, and feelings of despondency, lack of worth and hopelessness reset in. It is easy to understand how these young long-term unemployed people maY' feel little value to themselves, their family and their community and even lose interest in the Once they lack self-esteem and confidence, this can lead to many other social, emotional, physical and psychological problems, such as depression, crime and even-tragicallysuicide. That is why the Howard government recently announced the work for the dole initiative: to help keep our young people motivated while they are looking for work and to help them feel worthwhile, to boost their self-esteem, to make sure that they do not feel left out and forgotten by society and, most importantly, to provide them with the opportunity to achieve by participating in community projects. The important thing to remember about the work for the dole scheme is that it is not a labour market program or a jobs subsidy scheme. We are not resurrecting Labor's failed Working Nation program, which failed miserably in helping the young unemployed and was the biggest spending with the lowest outcome program of any labour market programs. Its only success in fact was in recycling unemployed people, as I have said, from one training program to another. We make no false claims about the work for the dole scheme. It is not a way for the government to artificially manipulate the unemployment figures as the previous government did. Participants will still be recognised by the government as being unemployed. They will still receive unemployment benefits. The opposition has criticised the work for the dole scheme largely because they now feel guilty that they did not introduce it during their 13 years of government. They have been making wild accusations-for example, that it is a form of slave labour. Nothing could be further from the truth, and they know it. Participants will work a set number of hours each week based on the amount of unemployment benefits they receive divided by the relevant hourly award rate for their age. This equates to two days a week for 18to 20year-olds and 2Y2 days per week for people aged 21 and over. This means they will still have plenty of time to actively look for work. Plus they will receive an extra $20 per fortnight to cover any additional costs like travel for participating in the work for the dole scheme. Another common misconception is that the scheme will displace jobs from those already employed. It won't do that. Rather, it will provide meaningful work experience to young people receiving unemployment benefits. While some projects may include a training element, the primary objective of the program is to instil workplace discipline and a work ethic in young unemployed people. It will engender a feeling of self-worth, motivate young people to continue searching for work and help them to break the cycle of unproductive activity and isolation that many of them experience. It will enable them to contribute something back into their communities, whether that be helping with, for example, Meals on Wheels, gardening at the local school or nursing home or helping in the restoration of a local historical site. In this way, a positive effect is created because the community will value their efforts. At the end of the day, participants will be able to feel a sense of pride in achieving and contributing to their community. They will have contributed towards receiving their unemployment benefits. It is true that Australia is still struggling to recover from the huge unemployment legacy we were left by Labor. Not only did Labor give Australia its worse unemployment level since the Great Depression but it left us with ingrained high unemployment, and youth unemployment hovering at levels of around 30 per cent and even higher than that in some regional and rural areas. We are under no false illusions that there are easy answers to our youth unemployment problem or that significant falls in youth unemployment will magically happen overnight. It will take time to fix Labor's mess and get more young people into full-time jobs. I must say at this point that I believe it is the height of hypocrisy for Labor members to come in here, one after the other, day after day, and criticise this government for the levels of unemployment that they created. The tragedy is that they had 13 years to do something about the problem of unemployment and they simply sat on their hands, did a lot of talking about so-called training programs, but actually achieved precious little. The proof of their neglect and inactivity is seen in the levels of unemployment we inherited and, in particular, in the high level of youth unemp10yment. Youth unemployment cannot be fixed overnight, it will take time, and this government is under no false illusions whatsoever that the work for the dole scheme is the an, wer to our youth unemployment problems. We realise that real jobs and lasting employment can only come from providing the right climate for investment and growth. This government is implementing a wide range of policies to attack the structural causes of our high unemployment levels. We are already starting to see the benefits of initiatives such as flexible workplace arrangements, reformed unfair dismissal laws and exclusion from federal unfair dismissal laws of new employees of small businesses with 15 or less employees until they have one year's continuous service and low interest rates. Until this assistance to small business and industry, from reforms initiated by this government, flows through and starts to take effect, we will not see significant changes to the level of unemployment. In the meantime, we recognise the plight of young people who just cannot break into the employment market. We must continue to help young unemployed and look at ways to maintain their enthusiasm and self-esteem while they are looking for work. Sadly, many of our young unemployed have known no other life than life on the dole. They or finished school and gone straight onto unemployment benefits, thinking it only a temporary situation until they find a job. Without ever being employed, they have not experienced the confidence, self-esteem, personal pride and dignity which ajob offers. The work for the dole scheme is designed to fill that gap and, in tum, give young people the motivation, incentive and confidence to keep applying for jobs while benefiting the communities in which they live. While the opposition continues to be cynical about this scheme, it has received almost unanimous support from the Australian public and certainly from residents in my electorate of MCEwen. Comments from young people, published the day after the Herald-Sun poll, indicated 94.5 per cent support. Typical was the comment of an 18-year-old who said: I think it's a good idea. It's good for the country to give us work and experience rather than hanging off the system. Two local newspapers in my electorate of MCEwen-the Hume Observer, which covers the Craigieburn area, and the Mountain Views, which takes in Healesville, Yarra Glen and Yarra lunction--conducted street polls on the work for the dole issue to gauge local reaction. The comments of local residents were published in the papers on 18 and 19 February respectively. Overwhelmingly, those canvassed supported the idea. One man from Healesville said: I think it's a great idea. It gets young people out of the house and teaches them the value of earning money. Another said: I think it's a good idea. At least it will give the kids an incentive and gives them something to do with their time. Yet another, a pensioner, said of the scheme: I think it's a very good idea. I've seen a lot of people that have lost it through not having any direction and not being able to contribute to society. It will increase motivation. Self-esteem is the biggest problem. A 21-year-old from Yarra Glen said: I think it's a great idea. I know that it's no substitute for a job, but to actually be out there doing something would make me feel better and get me ready for when I could work. I'd feel better about have left taking money each fortnight. Another important aspect of the work for the dole scheme is that it will enable people on unemployment benefits to make a contribution to their local community in return for the income support they receive. The scheme will focus on community based projects that provide direct benefits for local communities and worthwhile work experience for young people. These projects must be of value to the community and have a significant level of community support. Since this scheme was first announced, I have been overwhelmed by the number of local organisations in my electorate of MCEwen which have expressed a keen interest in the work for the dole scheme. The Shire of Mitchell, Shire of Yarra Ranges, Shire of Murrindindi and Kinglake District Neighbourhood House are just a few of the groups which have indicated their eagerness to become involved in the scheme. They have also forwarded project suggestions to me for the work for the dole scheme which would greatly benefit their local communities. Some of these projects include township development, landscaping and construction works, tourism information work, development of walking trails and refurbishment of local landmarks. Darrell Treloar, the Chief Executive Officer of the Shire of Mitchell, states in correspondence to me: From the outset I should confinn Mitchell Shire's interest in being involved in piloting this initiative. We are particularly conscious of the problems confronting youth unemployed in the Shire and recognise that this initiative may assist in encouraging and facilitating the young into the workforce. Mitchell Shire has developed a detailed proposal involving three local projects, which would not only provide young people with a real sense of community involvement, but would help them develop skills and employment contacts, which could help them towards a permanent career path. Shirley Symons from the Kinglake Neighbourhood House said her organisation is very keen to become involved in this new government initiative. A total of 70 pilot programs will be established, primarily in regions which have the highest levels of youth unemployment. Although there will be some projects established in metropolitan areas, I am pleased that the projects will focus on rural and regional areas, for it is these areas, especially in communities like those in MCEwen, which have been the hardest hit by the previous Labor government's woeful economic and unemployment policies. Labor's 13 years in power tore the heart out of many small communities, with business closures and countless job losses. Young people were forced to move to larger regional centres or to capital cities to look for work. This scheme will begin to give something back to those communities and start to repair the trail of destruction Labor left behind. The government expects that the participation of the vast majority of young people in the work for the dole scheme will be voluntary, and the level of support in the form of expressions of interest and actual submission of projects certainly supports this view. However, this bill does provide the provision that someone in receipt of an unemployment allowance may be required to work in an approved program to receive that allowance. The government plans to publicly seek submissions from local communities that wish to run programs in partnership with the government, local service groups, businesses, welfare groups and young people. Young people are our future. The Howard government has already shown its commitment to young people through its new trainees hip system, the Green Corps, youth homelessness program and national youth suicide strategy, to name but a few. The work for the dole program is another important step towards showing our young people that they do not face the future alone, that they have both the support and the assistance of the government and their local community. I hope that older unemployed people will be able to take on supervisory roles and act as mentors in many of the projects in the work for the dole scheme. (Time expired)",173
254,Mr GRIFFIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"We are here tonight to debate the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997. This is, as is obvious from the debate tonight, a contentious issue for a range of reasons. One thing is still unknown. Essentially, at this stage we are debating a concept, and there are some arguments about that concept which should be made. We are still to see the detail of how it will operate and it is my contention that the devil will be in that detail. I would like to take up a couple of issues that a number of speakers have raised today, particularly from the coalition side. One issue that has been made a great play of is the question of public support for this initiative. It is certainly true that a lot of people, particularly ordinary Australians, when approached about this issue-I would say 'this concept' - have expressed support for the idea. But, as I said, the problem here is that we do not know exactly how this is going to work and it is one of those questions, when put to people in the street, that is almost designed to elicit a positive answer. Public support is a fickle thing. As someone who was part of a government as recently as just over 12 months ago, I know these things do change. To give some recent examples on public support, if you go on public opinion polls, the recent debate on euthanasia that occurred in this House and in the other place created overwhelming public support for euthanasia. However, this parliament, on a conscience vote, decided that that should not be the way it is going to be. Capital punishment is another issue which regularly elicits strong support in terms of public opinion polls. Another one which I think is more relevant in the circumstances of the debate tonight is Fightback. When Fightback was first introduced as a policy some years ago the circumstances were that there was very strong public support. Even the question of a goods and services tax initially had strong public support, but over time as it was debated, discussed and went through that public support evaporated pretty quickly. It is my contention that that is what we will find with this initiative. I draw one example of that to the attention of the House. When prior to the last election the coalition was doing everything in its power to not frighten the horses this initiative was ruled out. Now it has made a come back, maybe even a 'Fightback'. Another issue which came up and which I would like to raise is the question of levels unemployment. The fact is that this nation and the world is facing a situation of very high levels of unemployment. That is certainly the case through the industrial world. That varies according to which nation you look at, but certainly unemployment is generally a lot higher now than it was, say, 30 years ago. The odds are that it is going to remain that way. It is a problem of the times not only of our nation but of many nations. It has also been said that the previous government had during its 13 years in office the highest number of unemployed this country has ever faced. That may be true, but I will tell you one thing that we did not have the highest rate of and that was young unemployed. When Labor was elected in 1983 there were 158,000 young unemployed and that was the highest in Australian history and John Howard was the Treasurer of the day. When we left government in March 1996 it was about 87,000. That was still too highno-one argues about that-but the fact is that it was a lot less than 158,000. In the first 10 months of Labor being in office in 1983, youth unemployment dropped by 8,000 or about five per cent. If you contrast that with the first 10 months of the Howard government, you are talking about youth unemployment up by 12,600 to 99,900, a rise of more than 14 per cent. When we look at the arguments and talk about who left what to whom, the fact is that in terms of the social problem I do not think any of us have really clean hands. The problem with this sort of issue and the debate that occurs is that we talk about the fact that it is complex and then we simplify it. The action of the government on this issue-and we have seen this from previous speakers-is to say, 'This is a complex issue. The problems of youth unemployment are not simple and the solutions are not simple. But, guess what, we have a simple solution. It is not really a solution, but it is our solution. It is the principal thing we have put forward since the election on what to do about youth unemployment.' The other thing I would like to address initially is the question of whether this is of really a new initiative. I think you have to understand the psychology of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and some, but not all, on the other side regarding this particular issue. I quote from an article by Mike Steketee in the Australian: We cannot accuse Howard of being inconsistent on this issue. That is the question of work for the dole. The article continues: He included it in his policies for the 1987 election. As employment and industrial relations spokesman, he persuaded John Hewson to put it in Fightback for the 1993 election, after Hewson had already said publicly that he was opposed to it. Considering that more and more of Fightback seems to be sneaking back into Coalition policy, it is worth recalling what Fightback promised, particularly if the Government decides to expand its present proposal beyond the pilot stage. It was to cut off benefits for the unemployed after nine months but to provide as one objection joining a work-for-benefit scheme. It is a program from which he will derive much more in public relations value than in progress towards tackling youth unemployment. At best, it will equip young people somewhat better to do real jobs. But it will not do so anywhere near effectively as the labour market program which the Coalition promised to retain in the election campaign but which were abolished in the Howard government's first budget. There are a number of arguments about a work for the dole scheme. I will start off with what I think is an unfortunate term-that is, work for the dole. The fact is that in our society there is a culture and a view about the term 'dole'. It is well understood, but essentially it is not a positive one. An element of that is that it is seen as demeaning within the general public. I think the title of this bill is unfortunate in that respect. Let us start off with some arguments for a work for the dole scheme. It is often held that working for a benefit will inculcate a work ethic. There is an argument there. I think it depends on the circumstances, what is being done and how that benefit is being derived. To be fair, with our Working Nation programs the same sort of work ethic was being developed. It was certainly a key component in what the previous government intended. I have found from talking to people who have been through those programs, all of whom did not get jobs-there is no argument about that, I do not think anyone has ever said that, but it seems to be a claim that is made; some did get jobs and some did not-that the levels of success varied greatly depending on the programs. But so did the circumstances of the people who were doing those programs. We are not talking about people who have gone through normal tertiary education or been in a situation where their circumstances have put them in a position to benefit easily from society'S opportunities. We are talking about people who are always, as a result of lower levels of education, socio-economic problems, where they live and geographical problems with unemployment, in a position of some difficulty. Another argument is that it will make recipients more employable. That is an interesting argument. I guess the question there is: how is this scheme going to be perceived by employers out there in the real world? I am not talking about street polls. I am also not necessarily talking about someone from the ACCI or a peak organisation. The question will be: what do individual employers think about these sorts of schemes? I suspect, and I think the experience with our programs was to an extent, that a lot of employers will look and say, 'Well, it is great that they have participated in this scheme, but what have they really learnt from it? What skills have they gained? What makes them a good option for my particular business?' We tried to address that through structured training and we had some success. The fact is that, with schemes such as this, it is a development over time. With any labour market program the circumstances do not remain static: you reform them and develop them in order to create a product which provides for the needs of the community it seeks to serve. Another argument is that it demonstrates to others that these people are employable-for example, they are adhering to the rigours of the work routine. Again, that is a key component in getting someone a job, or rather getting them to be able to stay in a job. But this program will do nothing more than was done in programs of the previous government and, in fact, will do a lot less. It deters people from becoming recipients. That is an argument which can be applied to almost any labour market program. Another argument is that it enables useful works to be done. But what is done? There is a statement in the bill, and there have been statements made by members of the government, about the intended actual operation of this scheme. Again, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. It increases public acceptability of the work for benefit system. It probably does· do that initially and the public comment that has been made would suggest that, but the question again will be whether that remains the view of the public over time. I think there are real doubts that it will. Against those particular arguments, we will have high administration costs. There will be a need to provide for materials. Perhaps some capital costs will be incurred, including training costs for proper use of items and for supervision. There is a tendency to blame the victim. Working for a benefit implies that the unemployed would prefer a handout, whereas the more relevant issue may be the scarcity of jobs. This is the key issue on what we do about unemployment and the issue of whether work for the dole is a panacea or whether it is a component of an integrated program, as some have suggested without being able to suggest what the other components of that integrated program are. That is a real worry because when we are talking about the scarcity of jobs we are actually talking about a situation of over 800,000 people unemployed. When job vacancies approach something like that level, when we can look in the Age or the Sydney Morning Herald, or whatever the relevant paper is in your area on a Saturday, and there are as many jobs there as there are people unemployed, and if those jobs happen to match the skills profile of those people who are unemployed, we can then start really talking about whether there is large scale bludging out there. The fact is there is not. Until that situation arrives, you cannot argue that there is, because there are not enough jobs in this economy at the moment, there have not been for a long, long time, and that is not just here-it is all over the world. Make work schemes may have little social value. Again, that is an argument to be established. The question will be: what will happen around the operation of this program? I have some severe doubts. It tends to reinforce the marginal attachment of individuals to the labour force. That marginality comes from the fact that, even if they want to be, they are being forced to be there. Even if they are doing reasonable work, then they are not doing it for very long and not getting any training. It may displace others from their employment. That, again, is an important issue and it will depend on what sort of work is actually done through work for the dole. Initially, we are talking about pilot programs and a total of only some 10,000 positions, mainly in regional Australia. But if the work that is done-if employers and groups are picking up work for the dole schemes and running with them-is work that would be done by others, work that is deemed by society or those areas as being essential, we may be creating another problem as we endeavour to solve this one. The obligation to perform work may overlook the structural changes taking place in the labour market: for example, employer demands for a skilled work force and the buildup of numbers of long-term unemployed who have lost, or never acquired, basic job skills because of recurring phases of unemployment. As I mentioned earlier, this is not a static issue. When we are talking about jobs, the types of jobs and the skills required alter every day. What is occurring in one area can be very different to what is occurring in another. Although this bill talks about flexibility, is that flexibility there? Beyond that, it is clear that the training will not be. Julian Pocock, from AYPAC, the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, raised a number of arguments against the compulsory nature of schemes like this. For example, they marginalise the unemployed into 'pretend jobs' and damage self-esteem. What he is really getting at there is that you are labelled, and that is a big danger in the way this scheme will operate. I hope it does not because I think it is going to go through. I hope it does not because I am worried about some of the people who will be involved in these schemes. But when you put someone into a short-term position, if you label that shortterm position 'work for the dole' and if they are in a situation where they do not gain training, you could do more to damage to their self-esteem-over the six-month period they actually have some-than to actually improve it. Another argument he raised is that it tells prospective employers nothing about a young person's enthusiasm for work, due to its compulsory nature. In talking to employers in my area-contrary to the claims of the government, most of us do-many employers have said to me, 'I am happy to employ young people, but what worries me is that if someone else will not employ them why should I?' That is what training improvements are all about. That is what a lot of the initiatives under Working Nation were about: bringing people up and gaining those basic skills of getting to work on time, being presentable, plus building up not only their self-esteem but other skills. You could go to someone in retail and ask, 'Do you want to employ a young person? This one has done a retail traineeship. This person has been working through another program and gaining skills that you need in your work.' But the problem and danger with this scheme, even more than the others, is the stigma around the question of what is work for the dole. Many employers will say, if they are stopped in the street today: 'I think this a good idea.' But if the follow-up to that is 'Right, fine, I happen to have someone here who has gone through this scheme and I want you to employ them', they are going to take two steps back and say, 'I'll have to think about that. I am not sure they are what I need. I'm not sure I want someone who has been forced into a scheme. I'm not sure I want someone who has not been through formal training in the area I need. And I am worried because, if they couldn't get a job before, why should I employ them?' And that is an attitude out there. It is a real attitude. It also ignores young people's existing skills, career aspirations and training needs because the question here is: where is the flexibility in this system in a wider sense to ensure that people get differing types of skills according to their particular talents or aspirations? I do not see it. There are some words there that could mean this is the case, but I doubt that very much. For one thing, it is too small. Also, it will add absolutely nothing of real or sustainable value to the domestic economy as they depend on forced labour to remain viable. Again, the fact is that underpinning this issue is the argument that it will be doing work which will not be done by others in normal circumstances. There is a concern beyond that of replacement of existing jobs or prospective jobs in the wider work force. But also much of what is being done will in fact cease with the expiration of the program. There is also another issue which I think is important, and that is that it could provide case managers with a quick fix and dumping ground for the unemployed. That is an issue. The fact is that a lot of what we did around these issues when we were in government was to do with trying to develop a system which gave people opportunity, practical skills and attempted to give them a chance to develop their potential. As many have said from the other side, sometimes it did not work. Well, we never expected it to work all the time. It was never going to work all the time. But the fact is that there was a greater sense of opportunity there. There was also a helluva lot more money is there. In the end, this is an economic issue; it is a resource issue. When you talk about youth unemployment and youth issues and you talk about this government, you have to mention $1.8 billion out of labour market programs, increases in university fees, making young people pay back their HECS debts sooner, making it harder to qualify for Austudy. Right along the line, for all the government's words about the fact that they care about the young people of Australia, their actions are in fact the reverse of that. The circumstances are that this program as proposed is almost certainly critically flawed and is almost certainly going to fail. In the meantime the government can be happy about the sort of support it gets in public opinion polls. But the issue is not now; the issue is in 12 or 18 months time, because then we will get an idea of just how well it has worked. Then people will be able to go beyond the question of the principle, the thought, to the reality. And they will find that reality is nothing like what they first thought. (Time expired)",177
255,Mrs STONE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I wish to speak in support of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997. This bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990. It provides for a framework to implement programs of work for people receiving unemployment benefits. We have called this the work for the dole scheme. It is a name that has been picked up and is already being used by mothers, fathers, the unemployed and members of the community to refer to one of the great incentives and initiatives of this government. While the financial impact of the measures in this bill is estimated to be about $1.3 million-that is in the 1997-98 year-the benefits for the unemployed, but in particular the young unemployed, are inestimable. This bill will put in place a program that aims to assist young Australians to gain experience in the world of work. It will bring them into contact with local government, service clubs and other young people, helping to build community networks and contacts for them, the sort of contacts they need to use in finding work and in their future employment. It will also give them the disciplines of regular work that will help them to be motivated and encourage them to break out of the despair and low self-esteem that come so often after months of searching for work and too many knock-backs. We have all seen the young unemployed, depressed, alone, forlorn, never experiencing the joy of making a contribution to society. This scheme gives them that experience. This is a community based scheme. Work for the dole projects are limited in their potential only by the imagination and needs of the communities that are supporting them. It brings the community forward to embrace the unemployed in a mutually rewarding experience. The amendment before the House today will establish the framework for the work for the dole scheme, to be implemented initially through a series of pilots throughout Australia but in particular in areas of the highest long term youth unemployment. These tend to be rural and regional areas. As well as gaining an experience of work, another very important rationale of the work for the dole scheme is the principle of mutual obligation. This principle is based on the understanding and recognition that, just as the Australian community has a responsibility to provide for those who cannot work, or who have not got a job but have been trying to work, there is, at the same time, a reciprocal responsibility on those unemployed people to make a contribution back to the community to the extent that they are able. The proposed changes to be wrought through his bill are: firstly, to establish a framework necessary to implement the pilot programs; secondly, to remove from the Social Security Act provisions precluding measures to compel a person to work in return for the payment of unemployment allowance; thirdly, to enable a person to voluntarily participate in a program of work which has been approved by the Employment Secretary or to be required to participate in such a program; fourthly, to provide for participation in an approved program of work to be included in the newstart activity agreement; and, fifthly, to provide a work supplement of $20 per fortnight for participants in order to take into account the additional transport, clothing and other costs associated with the work that they do. There will be 50 projects allocated to targeted regions, and another 20 projects, to ensure that quality projects from non-targeted areas are not overlooked. We expect the main participants will be aged between 18 and 24 years, and we believe we should target those who have been unemployed for more than six months. The groups hosting the work for the dole project will have to meet a number of obligations. There is no way that this can be a case of the most vulnerable-the unemployedbeing exploited by people in the private employment sector looking for cheap labour. That is not going to be possible given the way we have structured this bill, and of course it is the opposite of our intention. The host organisations will be required to provide a minimum standard of employment experience, supervision, essential training and a number of practical things, such as transportation costs to work sites and necessary equipment. All the occupational health and safety criteria will have to be met. It is expected that the dole projects will for between three and 12 months. The aim is to find 10,000 places in work for the dole projects throughout Australia, with the first commencing in September this year. The work for the dole scheme is primarily a voluntary one, and young people who want to take advantage of the benefits and experience of the scheme will be invited to do so. Given the huge number of opportunities out there for quality projects in so many areasespecially in places such as my electorate of Murray-there will be a range of work the young unemployed can volunteer to do. Having said that, however, where necessary and appropriate, it will be possible through the scheme for people to be compulsorily referred to a work for the dole project. It is interesting that in my electorate of Murray a number of parents have come to me and said, 'We do hope that when you introduce the bill there will be a compulsory element, because we have difficulty communicating to our unemployed sons and daughters and we want them to take advantage of this scheme. We don't think they will volunteer, but we think it's important they get out of the home, away from the TV set and out there in the community . We would like some compulsory element.' So it is insightful to hear about the experience of some of the mothers and fathers who face the dilemma of having their children unemployed every day. They are asking for some compulsion. There will be penalty provisions for breaches of the requirements of the work for the dole scheme-for example, if a person who is compulsorily referred to the scheme fails to complete it without a reasonable excuse or if they do not comply with the conditions of the program. There need to be some penalty provisions. That is part of the responsibility of being at work. These penalties will be the same as those that currently apply to the social security system, and they are based on the fact that unemployed people have an obligation to actively seek work and improve their chances of gaining employment. As an incentive, however, persons who participate in this project and who have had their payments run from a previous scheme cancelled or suspended will have their penalty period waived, provided they then meet all of the requirements of the work for the dole scheme. The work for the dole scheme clearly will not be appropriate for all unemployed people, and there are a number of safeguards to ensure that the program is targeted to those who can most benefit. For example, the scheme may not be appropriate for people who have particular skills, who have recent work force experience or who are only very temporarily unemployed. You would not want them locked into a long-term project which may not take full advantage of their previous work experience. Some of the important safeguards in our proposed scheme include: the number of hours required to work will be based on award rates of pay; 18 to 20-year-olds may not be required to work for more than 24 hours per fortnight-which is two days per week based on a six-hour day-participants who are over 21 may not be required to work for more than 30 hours per fortnight, that is, 2Y2 days per week; participants are required to participate for a maximum of six months; and the compulsory aspect of the scheme will only apply to people who are receiving the full rate of unemployment and where it is assessed that there is no risk to the participant's personal health and where there is no contravention of the occupational health and safety laws. There have been some suggestions that Australia could be in breach of its international obligations by introducing this scheme. Quite patently, this is wrong. It is just mischief-making to try to suggest that this does anything other than help our unemployed. As the advice of the Attorney General's Department suggests, the obligation is that the work offered is suitable and reasonable for that person. The scheme is clearly designed to meet the 'suitable and reasonable' criteria. The scheme is not intended to provide someone with a qualification, nor does it state at the outset that it will take someone who is unskilled in a particular area and see them walk away with a set of skills they did not have in the first place. It is aimed, as I said before, at giving people interpersonal skills, a raised self-esteem, work habits, networks, friendships and experience of what it is like to make a contribution to the community. This we see as being essential for young people as they move towards an adult life where unemployment is very short term and, hopefully, a one-off experience. What this scheme will do is lay the framework for addressing the issues facing some young Australians and, in particular, ensure they have the confidence to move into the work force. Thus, you have to see the work for the dole scheme in the broader context of assisting young people. This scheme is not like so many of the previous government's schemes where they implied that the unemployed would get some sort of certificate, accreditation or qualifications tion, then when participants tried to use the qualification to gain employment they found that, without any actual work experience, they were not much better off. What this scheme is about is teaching interpersonal skills and attitudes to work, networking and raising the self-esteem of young people, too many of whom have suffered from periods of long unemployment. Already this government has addressed the training needs of younger people and the unemployed. We have introduced a new national apprenticeship and traineeship system. These are of particular importance in parts of my electorate of Murray where young people and industry alike stand to benefit from expanded apprenticeships and traineeships in our agricultural sectors. For example, the Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAPE ran one of the first pilot dairy traineeships in Australia. My area is the major exporter of dairy produce. We have had an extraordinary situation where, on the one hand, there were 100 dairy traineeships unfilled and, on the other hand, there was a dairy industry sector crying out for experi-nced, trained young workers-labour and managers. Too often it is a case of there being work that needs to be done and young people who are not employed, and the two ends do not seem to come together. This problem we have in our society is being addressed through the government's apprenticeship and traineeship system which goes further than just training to actually linking industry with training. Another very important area of development is in vocational education and training and valuable programs such as the jobs pathway. These provide job placement assistance to students who successfully complete vocational education courses in years 11 and 12 at places like Shepparton East Secondary College. In addition, in other programs, students are mentored by local businesses like our dairy manufacturers. Those young students completing years 11 and 12 work during their vacations for the dairy manufacturers. They are developing their networks, their reputations as fine workers, their skills and their qualificain food technology. That is an excellent scheme and one which we hope will be echoed in so many other of our industry areas across regional Australia. There are organisations with strong links to industry, such as the Northern Industry Education Board in my electorate, forging ahead into these new areas of vocational education now that they have the incentives of this government. I have mentioned food technology and I have mentioned dairying. We are also very concerned to make sure that we can meet our growing tourism locally with welltrained hospitality and tourism graduates. The work for the dole scheme is another initiative that will help some of our unemployed to step into traineeships and apprenticeships when they have broken the habit of being at home, on the streets and, indeed, in some cases, homeless. We hope it is a stepping stone for many. The work for the dole scheme was devised in recognition of the particular disadvantages young people face in getting jobs. These include the fact that many of the low skilled jobs that young people used to move into on leaving school are disappearing as technology in our country changes. Those jobs that do remain for young people are fiercely contested. They come up against the older, more experienced and more mature members of the population and they receive knock-backs again and again. The problems I have just referred to are exacerbated in the rural and regional areas Australia. Too often the advertisements in the metropolitan dailies are tantalising, but they require students to move away from their families to the city. The costs of relocation, the costs of transport and even the costs calling home for the newly employed are much higher for rural people compared to those who already live and are established with their families in metropolitan areas. Rural and regional areas have some of highest rates of unemployment in Australia. Youth unemployment is a critical problem in my electorate, especially in the west of electorate. Youth suicide rates are also critical problem in Australia. I believe the are linked. To have gone on as a nation and ignored the problems of our young, long-term unemployed and to have overlooked the problems of our youth suicides would have been callous and not in the This government is addressing youth suicide issues and important initiatives are being put in place right now. This government is also addressing training at both the tertiary pre-tertiary level through its new apprenticement ship schemes, and it is also addressing the problem of encouraging the first tentative employment step through the work for the dole program. We have a total concern and total commitment. We understand it is complex, multifaceted problem, so we are tackling the problem on many fronts. As I said before, participants in the for the dole scheme will be employed to expired) undertake a range of community assistance and development type projects. Unless groups of people are sponsored and mentored to do journed. this work, too often jobs go undone in remote rural communities such as the electorate of Murray. For example, we have a lot of revegetation problems in our areas of high saline watertables. The only seed trees are a few remnant mature trees. Growing native species require seeds to be collected and planted that revegetation can be established on a of our roadways, in our forests and on our farms. When we first announced the work for the dole scheme there were so many in our community who came forward and silid, 'This of is the opportunity for our young unemployed to help us fight our high watertable problems and to get stuck into the revegetation problems that face us where we have had a long period of tree decline.' Of course, with tree of decline goes the loss of our biodiversity. We have community groups now looking at a range of projects that would best suit this scheme. They range from the environmental projects I have just mentioned to projects the such as helping disabled students in our schools who need a lot of personal assistance in things like toileting, helping them to get the their lunch and to move in and out of the a classrooms. Although disabled students two perhaps need some special teaching assistance, this sort of personal assistance in the form of looking after their physical needs during the day is an ideal contribution for someone who is engaged in the work for the nation's interests. dole scheme. There is one school in my electorate which has a young, very intellectually able student who has a severe physical disability. This and young person is being held back at the mobecause she needs someone to help her with many of her personal needs. This is an ideal situation for a person who has the right interpersonal skills and aptitudes to help a young Amy in her school. Furthermore, there a are many other worthwhile tasks-for example, as companions to the elderly and isolated in our communities. This is the work where too often there are no other funding options. work I commend the bill to the House. (Time Debate (on motion by Mr O'Keefe) adNORTHERN TERRITORY: NA",181
256,Mr OKEEFE,CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM,"I felt it necessary to make a few comments in the House following the speech made earlier in so the day by the member for the Northern lot Territory, Mr Dondas. What he has done in the House today does warrant the scrutiny of members. At all times in the whole debate on the Andrews private member's bill the member for the Northern Territory said in this place that he would be demanding that the rights of the Northern Territory be stood up for and that if the parliament did overturn Northern Territory's euthanasia legislation he would be resigning from the CLP and sitting on the cross benches in this parliament. What has happened today is that he has come in here and tabled the draft constitution that he is proposing for the Northern Territory in its quest for statehood. In his speech there were lots of complaints about this decision of the parliament to overturn the Northern Territory legislation, but how far has he been prepared to go? He has announced, on behalf of his constituents, that they are angry, his words 'that their parliament democratically elected by territorians has been overridden by another parliament'. He then goes on to say in respect of statehood that he acknowledges that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the coalition have a commitment to statehood for the Northern Territory. I have news for him. On ABC radio in an interview with a journalist in South Australia this morning the Prime Minister said that he was not much excited about this question of statehood. It is worth contrasting too that in the last 18 years the federal government has never taken a move such as this to overturn the rights of the Northern Territory. On this very issue of the Andrews bill the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, was approached and asked to directly intervene and overturn the territory legislation. His position as Prime Minister of Australia was that this was properly a matter for the territory and he chose to leave it as such. We have had the member for the Northern Territory-in this particular case representing in this place the very people who preach states rights and statehood-screaming at the ,_, p of his voice, when his government and Prime Minister Howard gave the nod to doing exactly what Paul Keating was not interested in doing, that he would take the opportunity to protest at the highest level. There are five Independents including three former members of the Liberal Party who have had the courage of their convictions. Mr Leo MCLeay-He could be the fourth.",185
257,Mr OKEEFE,CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM,"He could be the fourth. I say to him that he is not doing himself or his credibility any good in this parliament to the come in here, talk about the strong protest from territorians and then in his speechwould you believe-say, 'I now call on the coalition to take the necessary action to create the seventh state of Australia by granting the Northern Territory statehood as soon as possible.' Here is a man who has made all the statements-not prepared to take the big step, not prepared to show the courage of his convictions-now standing within the government and calling on the government to do something that he knows they do not have the to use slightest interest in doing. Mr Latham-He is not even in the chamber.",186
258,Mr OKEEFE,CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM,"He is not even in the chamber at the moment to argue his case further. It is worth us understanding the facts of this matter. Firstly, you have got two of them; one is in the other place, now a parliamentary secretary. Mr Leo MCLeay-He took the 30 pieces of silver.",186
259,Mr OKEEFE,CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM,"The member for Watson intervenes and says 'He took the 30 pieces of silver'. I think that is the bottom line because both of them were taking this stance that, were the Andrews bill to be successful, they would be standing up for the Northern Territory and leaving the coalition. What we have seen come out of both of them during the last few days are all the reasons why that cannot be so. It should not go without notice in this parliament that this would be one of the first private member's bills for years to get this kind of progress through the government and the parliament. Why was that so? It was because the Prime Minister gave his imprimatur from day one to the Andrews bill irrespective of the wishes of the Northern Territory and the wishes of the member for the Northern Territory. It also throws into interesting relief the performance of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Shane Stone, who must be one of these great advocates of statehood. He has been claiming at all times in the territory to have the ear of the Prime Minister and to be constantly on the phone to the Prime Minister right through to the crunch points of this debate. If he did have that sort of access, it certainly did not do him much good. The most interesting point is that, in the same radio interview, the Prime Minister said that he was only just in favour of the Andrews bill. He said that his own position was very difficult to work out. Yet when it becomes juxta-positioned against something as substantial as the rights of the Northern Territory-something which the former Prime Minister was prepared to say straight up-front was not a matter for the federal parliament but a matter for the Northern Territory to resolve itself-this Prime Minister, even though the party to which he belongs and leads preaches states rights, was not prepared to give credence to the Northern Territory in this position. This leads us to a conclusion that the member for the Northern Territory can hardly be taken seriously when he comes into this place, makes his speech and tables a draft constitution as some sort of great move that he is behind the rights for statehood of the Northern Territory, that he is going to spend the next X number of years fighting for the rights of the Northern Territory. He has been given the opportunity in this parliament right now to actually put up or shut up, show that he has the substance of the other three former members of the Liberal Party who did resign from the party and now sit on the cross benches, but he has been sadly found wanting and cannot expect to escape the microscope of this one for many years to come. Debate (on motion by Dr Wooldridge) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (WORK FOR THE DOLE) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",186
260,Mr LATHAM,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Werriwa) (8.39 p.m.)This Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill is important not for what it achieves but for the failures it identifies in the policies of the Howard government. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has devised a strategy for political gain, but not a strategy for effective governance. The political cycle in Australia now pivots on the time likely to elapse before the government's social populism is overtaken by its failure to deliver on the fundamentals of federal government--employment creation, income security, social mobility and social connectedness. This bill, again, demonstrates the large gap between the coalition's election campaign rhetoric and its capacity now in power to solve the problems of social and economic insecurity. The coalition promised real jobs for Australia's long-term unemployed. I recall Mr Howard six days prior to the last election, in his TV debate with Mr Keating, specifically promising to deal with the youth unemployment problem in Campbelltown in my electorate by putting young people to work five days a week in the private sector. This bill seeks to put them to work for their unemployment benefits for 1Y2 days a week in the social sector. The Prime Minister has found it easy to create jobs for the likes of Donald MCDonald, Michael Baume, Jim Short and even Pm Goward. The young unemployed people in my electorate are still waiting for the creation of their real jobs. The Prime Minister's first decision in office was to confiscate Sydney's best piece of public housing, Kirribilli House, for the exclusive use of his own family. Soon after, he abolished the better cities project and its allocation of $20 million for the upgrading of public housing and the creation of new construction jobs in my electorate. Real jobs for the Howard mates; work for the dole for the young unemployed. Ostentatious public housing for the harbourside Howards; public housing cuts for families in my electorate. The former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, sometimes spoke of throwing the switch to vaudeville. The member for Bennelong's understanding of public policy extends no further than throwing the switch to downwards envy, encouraging people in work to believe that their situation will be enhanced by punishing those out of work. This legislation was switched on in tandem with Bob Woods's libido. It was announced by the Prime Minister, ironically enough, to distract public attention from the issue of family values, not the types of family values mouthed in this place by the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) but the types of family values practised by their colleague, that other founding member of the Lyons Forum, Bob Woods. Because Bob Woods and Roxanne Cameron could not stop working on their travel budget and other allowances, young Australians are now being called on to work for the dole. This bill is important not for what it achieves but for the failures it signals not just in the policies of the Howard government but also in its public morality. This bill has been introduced under the banner of reciprocal responsibilities. This is not a new concept in Australian public policy. It was pioneered by the former Labor government in its Working Nation statement. The recipients of unemployment income support were obliged to accept a training position, subsidised job placement or otherwise have their benefits withdrawn. This legislation and Working Nation, with its active labour market programs and skills focus, set out two very different approaches to the question of reciprocal obligations. The coalition believes in what I would term 'functional obligations'; that is, an argument that anyone receiving government assistance has an obligation to reciprocate, not by virtue of what they can do for themselves, or even society for that matter, but as a narrow function of the act of assistance itself. This view of human nature discounts the possibility of altruism-the idea that people might help others on the basis of need and compassion rather than a functional expectation of reciprocity. Obligations such as these narrow the role of government. Instead of acting as a point of partnership between the individual and society, the public sector is reduced to an entirely coercive role. It uses its public authority to impose reciprocation essentially for no other moral purpose than reciprocation itself. By contrast, the ALP believes in 'positive obligations' - the role of the public sector in creating reciprocal trust and obligations in a manner mutually satisfying to both society and welfare recipients. Reciprocation should be much more than an end in itself. It should be framed as a partnership by which the interests of society and the individual are advanced concurrently. During this era of economic globalisation and insecurity, each of us as individuals needs to do more to advance our own interests-to study harder, to work smarter, to develop competitive skills which deliver job security in an open economy. But just as much, we also need to do more together-to look out for each other, to help those who are struggling to help themselves, to support each other in the interests and values we hold in common. I would argue that globalisation gives to government two core functions: helping its citizens to combat insecurityeconomic and social-plus providing in common a threshold of capability and freedom for citizens to achieve their life's potential. This is why the public sector has no more critical set of reforms. than to improve society's attainment of skills-economic and social-through the principle of positive obligations. This requires a shift from passive systems of welfare and the establishment of a two-way street in the work of the welfare state. In a skills based society, minimum standards of income support are not in themselves sufficient to alleviate poverty and foster social mobility. A starting point is to recognise that skill formation is an interactive process. Its success relies on a partnership between the skill provider and the skill recipient. This is a substantial break from the ethos of transfer payments which imparts a passive relationship between providers and recipients; that is, governments fund a minimum level of income support, as one of the rights of citizenship, without regard for the responsibility citizens exercise in their use of this support. A welfare state aimed at social capability needs to entrench a sense of reciprocal responsibilities, that is, funding responsibilities as well as rights: the rights of needy citizens to receive government assistance but, just as much, their personal responsibility to make best use of that assistance through training and skills development. Skill formation relies on the efforts of both providers and recipients. It replaces passive welfarism with an active partnership. It makes the welfare state a two-way street rather than a one-way street. It seeks to strengthen social capital and capability by putting as much emphasis on responsibilities as rights. In this fashion, positive responsibilitiesreciprocated through a social partnership between government and citizens-aid the strength of our society. Unlike the functional responsibilities of the coalition, they do not set the interests of those in work against those out of work in a contest for public entitlements. Positive responsibilities strengthen us all. They aid the unemployed by developing their skills and reconnecting them with active work. They make Australia a smarter nation, a nation made competitive by the skills and economic capacity of its citizens. They give each Australian the freedom to achieve a threshold of social capability and, if they seek it for themselves, social mobility. This notion of positive obligations helps resolve the conflict between the two dominant ideologies of this century: collectivism and individualism. It brings these two ideals into harmony by establishing mutuality between the responsibilities of the individual and the social obligations of the state. Individualism and collectivism are made to coexist by the potential for social mobility: active government uplifting the capacity of its citizens; individual recipients taking responsibility for helping and skilling themselves to their full potential. This is something that demonstrates that reciprocal responsibility should not be regarded solely as an agenda of the political right. Left of centre causes have long held that citizens hold obligations in common. We want people to trust in and care for each other. We want people to pool their resources and provide for each other collectively whenever interests are shared among the citizenry. We want government to act as an effective expression of these obligations. We want the public sector to foster positive responsibilities across all of society. In this way, our philosophy of mutual obligation is very different indeed to the functional responsibilities reflected in this bill and those advanced by the coalition. Labor's approach combines social responsibility with the liberating horizons of social mobility. It says that, whenever the public sector works with citizens to advance their skills, our society is made much stronger. It says that altruism and compassion still have a place in our society. It says that the best governance comes from helping people who know, in tum, that they help themselves most by making best use of public sector assistance. Labor's approach relies on this powerful mix of social assistance and social responsibility to engineer social mobility. The coalition, by contrast, sees no greater horizon for social assistance than a narrow set of functional responsibilities. It has no faith in the capacity of the public sector to produce a stronger society by acting in partnership with its citizens. This is why the work for the dole legislation is so limited and so narrow. This is why the coalition does not trust in public sector solutions to unemployment. This is why the Howard government is willing to use the coercive powers of government to make people work for the dole but is not willing to use the public sector's role as an employer, as a provider of basic community services, to lower Australia's unemployment rate, especially in depressed regional labour markets. Another shortcoming in the Howard government's approach to reciprocal obligations is a lack of consistency. If these obligations are to be applied to the social welfare sector, then why isn't the same standard applied to business welfare? Australians contribute $6 billion in income support for the unemployed, yet nearly three times that amount is allocated to industry assistance for the private sector. Why are the young unemployed, one of the least powerful groups in our society, expected to reciprocate in good faith by working for the dole while handouts to the business sector in Australia-benefiting some of the nation's wealthiest and most powerful citizens-remain open ended and largely unaccountable? There is, therefore, a sound moral argument for the introduction of reciprocal obligations in the allocation of industry assistance; that is, firms should have to provide a guarantee that public subsidies will be used to actually create employment rather than actively shed labour. Equally, firms applying for industry handouts should have to comply with a public code of corporate governance relating to sound practices for executive salary restraint, wage equity in the workplace plus shareholder and worker participation in corporate decision making. At a time when the nation state is trying to exercise leverage over global capital, these responsibilities are an important means by which corporate governance can be made to match the public interest. The public's concern about outrageous executive salaries, corporate tax avoidance and shoddy business practices is no less substantial than public hostility to social·welfare abuse. Earlier this week, the government introduced a $600 million package for small business. While, in the work for the dole bill, it plans to pay unemployment benefits on the basis of reciprocal responsibilities, the Australian taxpayer has no guarantee that the small business package will actually create additional employment. It is possibleespecially with open-ended tax concessions and subsidies-that these funds will result in nothing more worthwhile than nonproductive capital speculation and higher profit margins. Under principles of reciprocated obligation, companies should be made to guarantee socially desirable outcomes in their use of business welfare, just as the young unemployed are being made to contribute to socially desirable projects in their use of social welfare. For the Howard government, business welfare remains a one-way street. Taxpayers in Australia fund an extraordinary $17 billion in industry benefits without any guarantee of the social return on their investment. The costs of production are socialised while returns to investment remain privatised in the hands of a small proportion of citizens. Day by day, the one-way flow intensifies. For instance, with the abolition of unfair dismissal laws, businesses no longer need to take a responsibility for the mistakes they might make in the selection of staff. I now tum to some ideas with regard to solutions to unemployment. The unemployment crisis in Australia and other Western nations reflects a crisis in economic theory. As a discipline, economics is yet to adapt successfully to two sea changes in economic activity. First, globalisation has made capital in the form of finance, investment and commodities exceptionally mobile. The chase for capital across the globe has made national economic controls and Keynesian economic remedies largely redundant. Their policy replacement, the competitive advantage paradigm, has positioned nation states in competition with each other for scarce capital resources. This paradigm, however, which essentially reflects a bidding war between nations is unlikely to solve the problems of economic exclusion and unemployment. Not all nations will enjoy competitive advantages and within nations not all locations will be able to attract footloose investment. In the public debate, economic policies are positioned as a competitive struggle between nations. In fact, the key economic contest is between the nation state and global capital. The nation's economic success does not lie in the subsidisation of footloose investment, but the skills and insights of its people. This can be the only lasting expression of national interest and economic sovereignty against the global integration of capital. Second, the widespread disaggregation of the scale of production, and advent of new information based technologies, has dramatically lifted the skills base for most forms of employment. This is reflected in the spatial concentration of unemployment. Low employment regions are locked into a cycle of low skills, low income, low investment, low spending and low employment creation. This is what makes the shortcomings of Australia's education and training system so important. High employment regions, like the seat of Bradfield, enjoy a virtuous cycle of high skills, high income, high investment, high spending and high employment creation. The economic skills of a nation or region are now the key to the creation of wealth and full employment. If Australia does not invest more in the education and skills of its people then unemployment will not be solved. Labour market deregulation is not the answer; it simply drives down wages and creates a new generation of the working poor. Competitive advantages alone are not enough, as in the competitive chase for footloose capital some nations and locations will still miss out. Business welfare is not enough. Subsidising the locational decision of investment simply socialises the costs of production while returns to investment remain privatised and increasingly globalised. National economic controls and Keynesian demand management are no longer sufficient. Just as capital has globalised its fear of economic activity, so too must the macroeconomic trade and investment policies of the nation state find new expression in supranational forums. Economic theory needs a new paradigm which deals with the global integration of capital and new skill based features of production. In labour market theory a starting point is to look to the neighbourhood effects identified by Bob Gregory and Boyd Hunter in their Australian research. A spatial analysis takes account of the mobility of capital, plus the particular skill requirements of each location. Old left of centre responses to unemployment relied on Keynesian notions of aggregated demand as the correct unit of labour market analysis. Neoclassical economics has analysed labour like any other commodity with a supply, demand, price and substitutable alternatives. In the new economy, however, labour and capital are no longer close substitutes, thereby discounting the analysis of real wage overhang approaches. The correct unit of labour market analysis lies at a neighbourhood level. This reflects a new radical centre for employment policies, customising government programs in training and education, workfare, infrastructure and public sector pump priming to suit the employment needs of each location. This is where civil sector employment has an important role to play. Government must reclaim its role as an employer of last resort, even if this responsibility is ultimately discharged by other community based organisations. The paradox of the post-industrial economy is that it has generated immense productive capacity and seemingly resolved the problems of production, yet a significant proportion of society remains excluded from the production process. The public sector should create new jobs by ensuring that people excluded from the market system contribute directly to civic projects. Society should no longer restrict its view of legitimate employment to private and public sector activities. In the post-industrial economy, full employment is most likely to be achieved if we are willing to fund civil sector jobs. As part of their civic responsibility unemployed people should be expected to initiate civil sector employment, not through day-anda-half work for the dole schemes but through substantial jobs, five days a week in the civic sector, fully funded by the state public sector. In this fashion, civic association should be able to sponsor work activities which strengthen their role in society. With the widespread depletion of social capital a range of projects are available: transport services for the frail aged; Meals on Wheels; assisting local sports clubs; improving municipal infrastructure and maintenance; environmental programs; assisting local schools; and complementing the work of service clubs, parishes and charities. Governments need to decentralise their scale and authority, placing resources and responsibilities in the hands of civic associations and welfare recipients. This requires a redefinition of the way society views employment. It requires governments to resource civil society in a fashion no less legitimate than its conventional services. It requires the creation of a civil sector economy from which the attainment of full employment is a social priority. This strategy fonns the basis of a successful approach to social and economic reform; investing first and foremost in the skills of Australians in a competitive economic environment. The countervailing role of government on a regional and neighbourhood scale is to provide jobs where competitiveness alone is not enough. Finally, using reciprocal obligations is the key to social mobility and economic success. It also demonstrates the huge gap between the ALP and the coalition on questions of employment and social cohesiveness. Labor used reciprocated responsibilities aimed at social mobility with a $1.8 billion investment in Working Nation. The Howard government applies functional obligations in a poll driven $15 million program with no training component. I support the use of the civil sector to solve the problem of unemployment, but not in the manner proposed in this bill. I support the use of reciprocal obligations across all parts of public expenditure, but not through the functional responsibilities proposed by this bill or its targeting of the social sector alone. I support the use of new measures to address the slow burning crisis of unemployment in Australia but not in the narrow self-defeating ways proposed in this bill. Something else is needed, a new economic paradigm to respond to the features of the new economy; a new answer to economic creation based on an appreciation of employment effects and appropriate mix of policies aimed at full employment, something this government could not achieve.

262,Mr TIM FISCHER,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The Export Market Development Grants Bill delivers on the government's commitment to maintain the EMDG scheme and to provide full rate access for the tourism industry for the first time. I am delighted to welcome an inbound tourist from Thailand, Dr Surin Pitsuwan, who is known to members on both sides of the House. He is an extraordinary leader from Nakhon Si Thammarat, in southern Thailand, who has given great service to the parliament of Thailand and to Thailand. In terms of this bill, the changes to the scheme are the subject of consultations. I have attempted to genuinely consult both with industry through Austrade and through the processes of the parliament. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and many other members participating in the debate have urged a particular course with regard to trusts, retrospectivity, airfares and a range of other matters. I undertook to examine these matters between the House of Representatives and the Senate. The government accepted, in the Senate, the trusts and, by that action, obviated out the retrospective aspects and accepted, for the full claim years, airfares for the one particular category involved. I guess this is, in a sense, what the workings of parliament should be about: the consideration of legitimate debate and submission that have been put forward. The changes embraced by the bill now returning from the Senate for its final deliberation will see continued eligibility under the scheme for trusts and airfares for all grant years. These changes have received the agreement of all parties in the Senate and it is now the job of the House to pass the bill in the same form as the Senate. I want to thank all participants in the process of consultation with regard to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill. The EMDG scheme has been of great interest not only to members of parliament and senators but also to industry and to the export industry especially. The package of changes provided by this bill ensures that the scheme will continue to assist small and medium enterprises to commence their export promotion programs and to improve and better target their ability in achieving those objectives. In a tough budgetary circumstance, I am proud of the fact that the federal coalition government has committed $150 million to the export market development grants scheme. That is a continuing commitment. In respect of the exactitude of the amendments, I would point out that amendments 1 to 11 and 13 to 19 effectively include the coverage of the scheme back to trusts, which are still a legitimate avenue of business operation where operators choose to elect to be a trust rather than a non-liability company or some other form of company. Mr Rocher-A self trader.",194
263,Mr TIM FISCHER,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"A self trader even. Amendment 12 includes airfares, in a sense, for all claim years. I find this to be a happy outcome. I know I will be accused of backflipping. I think that is a little harsh. People want the parliament to have a participatory role. This is a particularly good example of debate in both houses having an impact on the ultimate outcome of the government's attitude, cleared by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and on the outcome of the legislation to finally pass the parliament. I commend the bill, as amended, to the House.",195
264,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) has been true to his word in this respect: in his second reading reply he undertook to this House to consider the question of the exclusion of trusts, which he has done. As he has said, to his credit, he has returned to this House with a Senate amendment to fully restore trusts to the scheme. This is not the time nor the hour, given that we are at the end of this sitting period, to fully chide the Deputy Prime Minister, but I make a couple of points. If this had been an example of genuine consultation, these changes would have been made following the submissions that were made to the exposure bill. The 190-odd submissions that were made in respect of that exposure bill, almost to a tee, made a range of points: firstly, that the $150 million cap ought not to be imposed; secondly, that to exclude trusts was pernicious and unfair, particularly as it applied retrospectively; and, thirdly, that the narrowing of the scheme, which the bill did, so far as eligible export activity was concerned, was wrong and export unfriendly. Those comments, in the main, came down to two prime categories: airfares and the protection of intellectual property by means such as registration of patents. As I say, to his credit, the Deputy Prime Minister has returned to this House fully restoring trusts and fully restoring airfares. The opposition welcomes these changes and has no objections to them. In different circumstances I might more ferociously make some points about the $150 million cap and the continuing exclusion of protection of intellectual property. The Deputy Prime Minister, in a sense, might well consider himself lucky that the cabinet dries have at least acceded to these matters. There is now an intellectual inconsistency in the bill. It is this: with the imposing of the cap, it is no more additional burden on the bottom line to include into the range of eligible export activity items such as patent registration and the like which continue to be omitted. The driving force of this bill has always been the budget bottom line, in disregard of what might be merit worthy or eligible export activity. So it would do neither the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), nor the Treasurer (Mr Costello), nor the other economic dries in cabinet, any harm to have included these matters, because not one more cent would have been imposed by way of a financial burden. This is a matter of some regret but, as I said in a press release today, 'Just the ticket, Tim', putting back the trusts and putting back the airfares. Given that it is nearly Holy Thursday, I will leave it at that.",195
265,Mr ROCHER,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"I will be much more generous in my comments to the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), having castigated the ministry in an adjournment speech last Thursday or thereabouts about ministers by and large not being here to sum up on behalf of the government. The Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister was here to see that legislation through the House. He responded as comprehensively as could have been reasonably expected and, at that time, he indicated that he would review the position of trusts in the scheme. I say to the Deputy Prime Minister that what he has done is an example of the way the parliament should behave. In other words, rather than being dragged screaming, he saw a point made and took it up. Despite the words of my colleague the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), I don't think he is lucky. I think he has gone to the cabinet with an argument. Whether that is a fact or not, he has come back here with the result that we wanted. The measures that are intended to be remedied are those two to which I objected most strongly during debate in this House. I am not saying that I don't have some other minor criticisms and-some might say-quibbles with other aspects of the legislation but, all, I think what the minister has come back with, albeit by amendment from the Senate, is entirely acceptable and a credit to the minister and, through him, to the government because they can be persuaded by argument. The member for Perth, despite his lack of grace, in a minor way, immediately preceding these remarks, was persuasive. I would like to think that I may have been persuasive, but that is flying in the wind. I have to say that it is one of those rare occasions in my 19 years in this parliament where I have seen points raised in the second reading debate in this House attended to by the government. It is so rare that I can't remember the last occasion that I was involved in one. I suppose if I have one regret, it is that the amendments had to be clarified in the Senate, but I understand that, given that the minister was very prompt in his reaction to at least one of the arguments mounted. The Senate took up the other on airfares and the result is 100 per cent. It doesn't require me to go over the matters again, except to say that my constituent, Mr Barry Crommelin, will be very pleased indeed, I am sure. He is a man who has run a company which has been involved in the scheme and stood to be penalised on the airfares issue and because of the proposed treatment of trusts. He would have been penalised on both counts and yet he is a successful marketer. He said in a fax to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that he is paying more company tax out of his export business than he is receiving in entitlements. That is an indication that, if you look at it in basic dollar terms, he is more than paying his way. But there is more to it than that. His effort and the effort of those exporters like him who are able to participate in the scheme are making a greater contribution in many ways, not the least being some sort of effort towards reducing our balance of payments problem. I am indeed grateful to the minister. I am full of praise for him and I am pleasantly surprised.",196
266,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"In quick response to the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), more in sorrow than in anger, I did make the point that the Deputy all in Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) undertook to examine the question of trusts and, just as I anticipated in the consideration in detail stage, he has fulfilled his word. I am somewhat wounded by the member for Curtin, who suggests that I was less than gracious. I would not wish to appear too churlish by being too obsequious.",196
267,Mr TIM FISCHER,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,I do thank the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). I do thank the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I do appreciate the comments in the context of this bill. I hope Order in the House might focus on this passage of legislation as an example of parliament at work instead of all the negative portrayal of parliament on that program. There is a challenge for them. And I wish you all a happy Easter.,196
268,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"There is a serious point which I am sure the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) will appreciate. That is this: we all come here with our different life experiences. One of my different life experiences before I came here was to work for a state Attorney General. I must say that, while I have said publicly that the most attractive thing about the Western Australian state parliament was the sausage rolls sold in the parliamentary dining room, one thing that the state parliament does better than the federal parliament, in my experience, is detailed consideration of a bill. This has been, as the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has rightly said, a rare example of where there has been some genuine detailed consideration of the bill in detail in this House, as it occurs in the Senate, where the detailed implications, clause by clause, have been seized by the minds of members. While tonight there has been some seriousness, some frivolity, and some wishing of 'Happy Easter', this bill has been a good example of where this chamber can, when it wants to, actually put its mind to the detail what a bill means. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA The following bill was returned from the Senate without amendment or request: Export Market Development Grants (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 NA AMENDMENT (WORK FOR THE DOLE) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",196
269,Dr NELSON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"In speaking to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997, I do not intend to speak to the detail. Many of the other speakers have already done that and will continue to do so. What I do want to address is the context in which this initiative is being taken by the government. Then, I wish to particularly address some of the effects of unemployment on young Australians for whom this program is intended, Today, I suppose, was like many other days in Australia. It was a day in which one young person died by their own hand, by suicide, and another 100 tried, so despairing are they of the kind of future that they see ahead of them. That is just one symptom of what I believe is a failure of our society. The health and well-being of young people, how well we care for the vulnerable, and the extent to which we nurture the idealism of young people are critical measures of any society. When he was President of the United States, John Kennedy identified the real struggles for his generation as being against tyranny, poverty, disease and war. In his column last week in the Australian, often Hugh Mackay canvassed the issue of heroism and he invited us to consider who in the 1990s are our heroes. In reflecting on this in the context of this debate, I wonder whether young people see our generation as having given up on the real wars of the 20th century. These days, many Australians, young people in particular, are tired and exhausted and the of romance of struggle which rallied earlier generations, those certainly who lived through the 1960s, for example, now seems all but dead. In a sense, those celebratory struggles of the 1960s which characterised young people of that generation have been replaced today for so many by simply a grim determination to survive. Life for a significant and growing minority of young Australians is one of despair, hopelessness and aggression which is directed against themselves and others. As Richard Eckersley has noted, it is a sad indictment on our society that, whilst we have been able to reduce the toll taken by disease and motor vehicle accident, we have failed to reduce that which has been exacted by despair. The thematic currency for youth suicide and the other problems that young people face, in my opinion-so well identified by Richard Eckersley-is our failure to transmit a sense of belonging and of meaningful purpose to young people. The threshold of resistance to despair has been lowered by a generation who have lost confidence that those who profess to lead in this country either understand or, worse still, even care about the problems that they face. Simultaneously-and this week we have been debating the euthanasia bill-well meaning but misguided advocates of euthanasia project a subliminal message, that death is a legitimate solution to what we think are insurmountable problems, that there comes a time when life no longer has any value, when with certainty it may be said that there is no hope. What the parliament actually did in supporting and carrying Kevin Andrews's bill was to say to young people, 'No, we don't believe as a nation that there is such a point at which there is no hope.' In 1994, the Economic Planning Advisory Commission commissioned a series of papers and a conference called 'Shaping our Future: Australia's National Strategies'. In commenting on the report, EPAC remarked: The relative balance of contributions from young people between hope and optimism on the one hand and pessimism and despair on the other gives concern for the impact our society and our world is having on children. Past generations of youth may not have written so much about crime and fear. It went on to say that 'Ambitions for our future', a document which contained the contributions from young people, found a disturbing pessimism and fear of the future among many young contributors. What Australia needed, they concluded, was strategic vision which would, in my opinion, play a catalytic role in generating a greater sense of optimism and a sense of purpose for the next generation. Hope is fragile, but it has always been a very powerful force in overcoming adversity. Amongst all of the things that have happened to young people over the last two decades, as destructive as they are, it is not the disintegrafeel tion of families, it is not the development of an underclass and intractable unemployment that has been most devastating, but rather we have allowed the creation of a culture in which young people feel that they have nothing other than themselves in which to believe. Thirty or 40 years ago we had that mesh of values-God, king and country-a set of principles by which many people lived, in which they believed and which guided them through the ups and downs of life. Now, in many ways, we have a vacuum. I ask honourable members to consider, if you were 16 or 17 today, in what would you believe? What are the values of this country and what place do you have in it? The problem is not that young people have not learned our values; it is that they have. The fashion in recent years has been to marginalise churches, to demean the importance of parenting as a full-time occupation, to push young people to the zeniths of educational achievement and to disparage voluntary work as the domain of do-gooders. However, the price of our shallowness has been paid by our children. For the first time in many generations, young Australians face a future that does not guarantee them a higher standard of living than that enjoyed by their parents. Yet the pressure of expectation created is cruelly short-changed by the reality that life delivers. Under the oppressive weight of the incessant materialistic imagery of BMWs, mobile phones and fashionable clothing, many feel that their future is nothing more than the subject of commercial and political exploitation. Whilst it may be a career limiting move for me personally to make this observation, I point out that I found it rather ironic that, whilst the Premier of Victoria is doing very good things with trying to further understand and prevent the problem of youth suicide, Mrs Kennett should be so visible in her promotion of a car which will be beyond reality for almost every young person growing up in this nation. Many young people feel that they are being pressured to remain in the education system beyond their natural abilities for jobs that they are not likely to exist. There is a generation of young Australians who have neither hope nor a sense of self-worth and who have effectively been cut off from the economic mainstream. Our greatest national challenge is to re-engage them. That in a sense is what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said on numerous occasions about the challenge of youth unemployment. What Australia urgently needs, in my opinion, is a national agenda for young people. Young people need a formal voice in the political process, in the decision making process which affects them, their lives and their future. I have argued, and I will continue to argue, for the establishment of a national office for young people attached to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet which would act as an advocacy focus for their ideas and their aspirations and to canvass the views of young people and to keep alive within governments the idealistic passions of young Australians. The appointment of Pru Goward to head the Office of the Status of Women, an appointment which I very much applaud, reminds me that young Australians need a similar vehicle for having their opinions and views heard at the highest level of government. It is in that context then that we consider this work for the dole bill. May I begin by respectfully suggesting to my cabinet and backbench colleagues that the first thing we do is rename this program. Perhaps it should be 'Young people building Australia' or 'Australia's future at work'. How many of us know what unemployment feels like? How many of us here have ever been unemployed? How many of us know what it really feels like on the inside not to have work? Some young Australians have never had a job. They feel that they do not belong and have no role to play in Australia. How do you think that feels in a country where people define themselves through their work. Within minutes of meeting somebody in Australia they will ask you what kind of work you do. What humiliation people must feel in saying, 'I do not have a job. I am unemployed and I have been unemployed for one, two or even three years.' Albert Camus wrote 'without work all life goes rotten'. George Orwell hit what I think is a painfully familiar chord in The Road to Wigan Pier when he wrote: It is only when you lodge in the streets where nobody has a job and where getting a job seems about as probable as owning an aeroplane ... that you begin to understand the changes that are worked into society. Of course he was reflecting on British society, but I believe it would apply here in a number of our large cities and indeed in regional Australia. There are young people who live in families that have known nothing other than poverty and debt-young people who, after 100 or more rejections, have abandoned hope of ever getting any kind of break. Youth unemployment remains stubbornly close to 30 per cent. Even if we were to achieve five to 5V2 per cent unemployment by the turn of the century, as the previous government hoped to through its white paper on unemployment, we would continue on present trends to see about 15 per cent youth unemployment at that time. So, in my opinion, it is time to add to the strategies that we undertake. Whoever is in government-and it is about time people here were a bit more honest about this-the fact is that people will continue to be unemployed and people will continue to lose their jobs. Hopefully, with the right kinds of policies there will be far fewer of them and many more of the policies that our government is pursuing. But there is a reality and a truth that needs to be addressed. I am sick and tired of people in public life not addressing it. I have not heard anybody who realistically expects in the medium-term that we are ever going to return to anything like full employment. That is the reality in which this bill and this initiative of the Prime Minister's is being considered. Unemployed 15to 24-year-old males are 64 per cent, and females are 82 per cent, more likely to report poor health, are 40 per cent more likely to endure psychological distress and are 29 per cent more likely to smoke, according to Australia's Health published last year by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Unemployed men in Australia have a 17 per cent higher death rate, 50 per cent more doctor visits every year and 35 per cent more admissions to hospital. The death and injury rate in children under the age of four is twice as high in families where neither parent works. Writing in the British Medical Journal in 1991 its executive editor, being Dr Richard Smith, having reviewed all of the literature, said: The evidence that unemployment kills-particularly the middle aged-now verges on the irrefutable. The pervasive problem for young people is, as I said earlier, a loss of hope. Feeling that they are of little value, is it any wonder that they suffer poor health? I think too frequently what we forget is that behind I-curves, fiscal drags, current account crises and participation rates are real people who seek to live real lives. Working to build Australia will not save the government money nor in itself will it create jobs. The self-evident cure for creating employment and curing unemployment is economic growth and unshackling the wealth creating sector. However, working for unemployment benefits will go a long way to dealing with the human dimensions of unemployment and that is what this is about. Imposing on young Australians a time structure in their day, providing social contact others and attaching social status where previously they had been demeaned and humiliated as dole bludgers, may just stop the rot to which Albert Camus referred. In making these comments, I would like to say to members that I spent almost a decade working in an area where there is 13 per cent employment-and I stress that I said 'employment'. That is in a part of the electorate of Denison and also of Franklin. I know the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) would be familiar with the area to which I refer. I also remember that when I was 13 my father, a maritime worker, lost his job and was unemployed for a year. It was probably the most difficult year of my family's life. I was unemployed myself for three weeks-which is absolutely inconsequential-but I remember what it was like. I will never forget lining up at the Commonwealth Employment Service, filling in a form and not having a job-this was a period before I embarked on tertiary education. This initiative might playa catalytic role in developing a strategic vision for Australia through intersectoral cooperation between governments-and that means federal, state and local governments-with business people, non-government organisations, individuals, unemployed people and programs that are being run by government agencies. What it requires is all those people working together to try to develop a program which up until now we have said is too hard and in some way beyond our wit and capacity as a nation to develop. Whilst some may be accused of simply following polls or of some of the other things suggested on the other side in relation to this, as far as I and the majority of my colleagues are concerned, it is not about that at all. It is about trying to restore self-esteem to a group of people who have, unfortunately, lost it-if they ever knew it. This initiative, as I say, might playa catalytic role in Australia's strategic vision. What we are actively saying to young Australians is that there is a place for them, that they are important to us, that they will be cared for and that this society will provide for them, no matter what their background or their ecowith nomic circumstances. But, in so doing, we are asking them to make a contribution to society and, in making that contribution, they are people of value and of worth. It would be worthwhile for everybody here to remember what Fred Hollows said shortly before his death when he spoke about human caring. These programs are not about forcing people out on the roads to fill in potholes and do menial labouring tasks. They are about giving people choices in the sort of work that they may choose to do. A lot of these programs are about the thing which gives us all the greatest amount of satisfaction: working for the well-being and welfare of other people. Some of these programs will involve caring for older people at home and in the community and might playa role in reconnecting some of these young people to the values of a generation of people whose sacrifice has made us what we are. Those people lived through depressions, went to war, counted their responsibilities before their rights and gave us a world where values were more important than material value, where the imagery of BMWs and things like that was less important than the value of proudly saying that you were not a social security beneficiary and that you were out working and assisting other people and where there was a value that said that we respect our past and are planning for our future. What we are going to do is say to 10,000 young people, in the first instance, that perhaps they are making a contribution to the future. I have heard the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), sincere as he may be, saying with some flippancy, 'This is only going to affect 10,000 young people,' and he reminds us that there are about 100,000 unemployed young people, and about 30,000 of those are long-term unemployed. I remind the Leader of the Opposition-·and others who, infected with the virus of cynicism, are in danger of losing their idealism and passion--of the story that was related at the breakfast for Unifem on International Women's Day. A 16-year-old secondary school student got up in front of an audience of 350 people and reminded us all of a story which will be familiar to most of us. I will tell that story now. A man is walking along a beach. At the end of the beach, he finds a young woman who is throwing starfish back into the sea. He asks her what she is doing. She says, 'I am saving the lives of starfish. I am throwing them back into the sea.' He says, 'That is a waste of time-you realise that there are hundreds of thousands of these starfish on this and numerous other beaches along the coast?' As she leans down to pick up another starfish and throw it out to sea, she says, 'I may not make a difference to all of those, but I will make difference to this one.' For 10,000 young people and their families, this program is going to make a difference. We will not be frustrated by the practical difficulties or the political oppositionwhether overt or covert-that comes from the opposition. This program, as I say, is not about creating jobs. It is not about imposing some right wing agenda on young people. It is not about economic rationalism. It is about the restoration of hope and the engaging of a generation of young people who, frankly, have lost it, and it is about saying to them that they are of value to us, that they have a place, that they are going to make a contribution and that that contribution is valued and respected by us all.",197
270,Mr ADAMS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) has made his contribution. He says that the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill is all about youth values. It will sort out their values. He does not say that they will get a job once they have sorted out their values, but he says that, if we make them work for unemployment benefit, everything will be okay. We will give 10,000 of them a bit of hope, and everything will be fine. He does not face the changes in society which make it a little bit difficult. He does not explain why values have changed. He does not want to face up to any of those things. He just suggests that, if we get some values back into young people, somehow they will tum out all right. That is about all he says. He says it is not about economic rationalism, nor about right wing agendas, nor about job creation. So it is 10,000 jobs or thereabouts, but it is not about job creation. We all know what it is about. It is about what the polls say and the opportunity to get some votes-maintaining the position of the government in the polls and nothing more. Let us look at it very cynically. That is what it is all about. It is not about creating jobs; it is not even about giving hope. It is a poll driven decision, and you know it. And if you cannot influence your government in the party room to do any better than this, then you may as well resign a and leave the parliament. You are just like the rest of your backbench. If you cannot go in there and stand up, if this is all you can get out of your Treasurer, then you have failed dismally. It is not as if other schemes of this sort have not been used by conservative governments all over the world. They have used this sort of sop in their electorates to give the perception that no-one has their head in the trough and is getting something for nothing. Schemes have been tried, especially in England and the United States, and they have all been found wanting. Work requirements for welfare recipients actually date back to the Elizabethan poor laws of the 16th and 17th centuries. So we are really going back to the values. In the 1930s, unemployed young people in the UK were press-ganged into work for the dole. So we have really shifted a long way from where these schemes came. An article in the New Statesman and Society in 1994 said that around 150,000 18to 25-year-olds went through a scheme between the wars, and were seen by the participants to be working in slave camps. The aim of the camps was to instil a basic physical and mental discipline into young people who were thought to have lost the will to work. Does that not sound really familiar: that the young people of Australia have lost the will to work and they basically need to instil into them some basic physical and mental discipline? Complaints about scroungers and dole abuse were very widespread in that day. The young people were despatched to camps for three-month stints of military style discipline and the pick and shovel. Work began at 6 a.m., and for about 12 hours they would be felling trees, digging ditches, cutting hedges, planting or road making. They were overseen by retired sergeant majors and police officers. It was like a labour camp, with very little experience gained-and that is what employers are particularly looking for. Workers were viewed, having completed a stint in these labour camps, as being at the bottom of the labour market and therefore they mostly ended up back on the dole queue. This is what is being discussed today. Young people are being forced into employment where they have had little training, there will be uninterested supervision, if any, and no real prospects at the end of the scheme. There has been no money allocated for supervision, so where is the supervision coming from? Of course, the scheme has a compulsion aspect. This compulsion causes many difficulties, particularly with respect to the implementation. This is far more extensive than if it were a voluntary system and people could feel as if they were helping themselves, getting an incentive, participating in something themselves that was not being forced upon them and they were able to gain from participating. But we had to bring the politics into it-the poll driven bit. And that is why it is titled 'work for the dole'. Putting young people into forced work takes them away from finding productive work or gaining training to be better equipped to find work. At least with Labor's job compact, this problem was recognised and careful case management gave young people an opportunity to gain suitable training to be placed in work that already existed. Working Nation provided a huge range of programs that allowed government and the private sector to create positions so that these young people could be subsidised while they gained necessary training to be able to warrant the retention of that job. This actually set the scene for long-term jobs to be created in both sectors and encouraged other programs that helped industry to expand, research and development to be carried out and new ideas to become established. In a number of savage cuts to these programs most of those opportunities have been wiped out, business research and development is contracting and going offshore because of the policies of this government. Business is seeking opportunities offshore and we are left with a sagging economy. It is a really great plan-I do not know who is thinking it all up. In an article looking at the Canadian scheme of workfare, written by Mr John Richards, he suggests that in the course of a study he did: ... contrary to the hopes of many naive supporters of workfare, such a strategy (of working for benefits) implies large costs and may well, at least in the short run, entail higher public expenditure than a less intrusive welfare strategy. So it can cost more to put one of these schemes in place than something else. Within Labor's job compact, there was a provision that a person had to undertake case management, training and on-the-job work experience before they gained the benefit. Although this had some compulsion attached to it, it did not hinder the process of that person finding a job and being equipped to do it better. Women, and in particular young women, have only featured recently in unemployment programs, and the sort of work being suggested, of digging ditches by hand and other such pastimes, can hardly be considered suitable work. Activities such as those that have been replaced by machines in the private sector are nonsensical if it is supposed to be training towards a suitable job. It is not even suitable to men these days. Landcare projects that require some physical exertion still require some technical knowledge, and people need to be trained and guided on how to do this sort of work. I have been looking through some of the literature on this and have not found an awful lot of positive views on work welfare schemes. There have been two significant efforts to reform the British and American work welfare system and neither have been particularly successful in operational terms. The political aspect has been a little more successful, in that it is easier to sell the concept of work for the dole than it is to actually implement a fair and economically viable scheme. There are moves now to scale down the role of T AFEs in training, to limit the number of places at universities to those who can pay and even to cut some secondary school courses. Education is being privatised, so those groups who are disadvantaged financially are also going to miss out on the training which is vital for finding work in today's environment. Add to this the work for the dole scheme as being proposed by this government and we are deskilling the nation, relegating our young people to permanent unemployment so their only hope of subsistence is really on benefits. Why do they think there are so many suicides among the very young, particularly young males? In Tasmania we have the highest suicide rates among young males in our highest unemployment areas. Don't you think these figures might be linked? What hope are we giving our young people? The young want to work. They will even cop this work for the dole stuff because they hope, they want and they are willing to try anything to have an opportunity to get into full-time work and to secure work so they can 'get a life'. That is the term they use when I speak to them. How can you find good housing and a happy relationship and have healthy and contented kids if you are permanently stressed looking for work that pays enough to keep you? Work for the dole is no sinecure. There is a lot of sacrifice just to be on it anyway. Most of the schemes in other parts of the world have been inadequate to their tasks. In Desmond King's book Politics of Unemployment and Welfare Policy in the United States and Great Britain, he states in his conclusions: Work welfare programs in Britain and the United States-workfare schemes, training programs for the unemployed and job placement assistance are the principal government responses to this pervasive problem. That is, the problem of unemployment. He continued: For the most part, the schemes included under these rubrics have been inadequate in their tasks. Without more serious commitment to developing apprenticeship style vocational skills (and skills that are transferable across jobs)for unemployed and marginalised peoplethe effects of unemployment will remain. So according to this person, who has studied the subject to some degree, working for the dole without any training component whatsoever means there will be nothing. The outcome of this scheme will be nothing. The member for Bradfield, who preceded me in this debate, basically said that in his speech. He had to aim his speech at what values are going to come out of this for young people, because he knows there is nothing in this scheme which will help or assist young people get into the work force. Nothing. He knows it is a politically driven piece of legislation, and that is why he based his arguments around the value system. As I was saying, with no access to these apprenticeships because of financial or other social reasons, there is little likelihood of breaking out of the poverty trap or of finding employment. We are blaming the unemployed for being unemployed and not the reasons why they are in that situation. I can remember only too well the dole bludgers arguments of the 1970s. I was in the state parliament in Tasmania. I remember the Fraser government was in power. Unemployment was on the increase. What was the answer to this? Dole bludgers. All of a sudden the term 'dole bludgers' started to emerge. It started to seep out into the community, and the debate about unemployment was that dole bludgers exist. It was not a situation about endeavouring to find solutions. It was about blaming the victim-blaming the unemployed for being unemployed. In my experience, there are very few individuals who prefer to be in the unemployment category. The young unemployed get older and they perpetuate the system, leading to hopelessness and despair. All the schemes have difficulty in succeeding, but at least those who have to implement them the tools to make the best out of them. The government should face up to the fact that the schemes in Working Nation were working. Change them, alter them or whatever, but at least give the ones that were giving young people some true hope some opportunity. That should be the way that this government is tackling this issue. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) put his hand on his heart at the last election and said that he would do something about youth unemployment, he could have done something positive, he could have done something real, instead of this little political exercise that he has embarked on. It will take some resources from Treasury and you will have to get some commitments to giving skills to the unemployed. It will need funding for supervision, funding for training, some form of insurance, some knowledge in teaching of occupational health and safety and the incentive to gain skills befitting the jobs that really have the vacancy rates today. The main jobs that the CES are advertising around Australia are in the hospitality, tourism, sales and health areas. These seem to have the most vacancies existing within them, but even these do not account for all those who are unemployed. How many skills in these areas are going to come from this program? Most speakers from the other side are saying none, that there are not going to be any jobs coming out of this. This is just for hope. The next move should be to make more jobs, develop the economy, assist research and development, facilitate new enterprises, protect Australian companies to the same degree as our trading partners and start putting the community back into some decision making. Maybe then we can do something about our young unemployed and not just this tokenism. If we are to get a scheme to work practically that is not just a political gesture, then we should accept that the proposal needs amending to provide proper and adequate resourcing. I will of course be supporting the amendment to endeavour to achieve that. I am convinced that many of these schemes can give work, but something has to be done about helping Australians back into the work force. Forcing them into schemes just to get them off the books is really a political scam. It will not work. It will achieve nothing. I do not believe that, even in the long term, it will achieve jobs. It will not achieve votes either for the governing party. I look forward to judging these schemes against the labour market programs of Working Nation in which there were very many in my electorate and in my state of Tasmania. I will be asking the electorate to compare what this government is trying to push on them compulsorily with what the previous government did in putting real dollars back into the community and by giving real training to the long-term unemployed and to the unemployed. The member for Bradfield was full of hope. We were giving hope with all the schemes we had in place, which is more than this scheme will do. I support the amendment. (Time expired)",201
271,Mr TONY SMITH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I strongly support the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997 before the House and oppose the amendment moved by the member for Sydney  speech I want to mention a few things in relation to some observations by the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams). As a colleague of mine on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I have great respect for him. With respect, the honourable member misses the point a little. This is not a program, an alternative scheme to Working Nation or anything of that nature to provide a labour market program; this is a scheme designed to inculcate a new culture into the unemployed so that they are responsible for putting back into the community what they take from the community. That is what is being inculcated. It is not a replacement or an alternative to labour market programs. When the honourable member for Lyons was discussing those programs he also made the observation that members on our side have not responded in any positive way to the rhetorical question of what skills are coming out of this. He said that most of us on this side of the House have said none. But that is not really correct. As I understand it-not that I have listened to all of the speeches-the most important feedback that I get from businesses in my electorate is that we need the right attitude amongst young people. Almost without exception, at a number of meetings I have had with employers, they say, 'Look, I'm not worried about skills. Give me attitude. Give me somebody who'll get out of bed in the morning and be at work at quarter to 8 or whatever. It's attitude. Once I have the attitude right, I'll do anything with them.' I see this particular measure as being a step along the way in getting that attitude right. When it is appreciated that there is that very widespread sentiment out there, honourable members opposite may concede, albeit grudgingly, that the scheme is not as bad as it is painted. It does provide a step along the way. It does not provide the answer. Nobody says that there is an answer to this dreadful problem-the scourge of unemployment-that is an easy answer. As I have said before, this is not purporting to be an answer to it. I was interested also in some of the remarks from the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). In the case of the member for Werriwa, it is clear that in his reasoned analysis-which seemed to be tangential to the scheme itself but rather was an attempt to paint a different direction in order to avoid talking about the actual scheme and examining and analysing the scheme-he made a number of statements which are consistent with the amendment which is before the House. He followed the line, as I recall that particular document, of calling on the government to apply the concept of reciprocal obligation to other public sector outlays, especially financial assistance to large private sector corporations. It rolls off the tongue well, but it does not take the gloss off this particular measure. In the case of the member for Hotham, who I find a really robust and likeable bloke, I have rarely heard from him a speech like the one he gave on this particular measure. It was very much a speech that lacked conviction. I kept asking myself, 'What is he really saying about this measure?' He expostulated about Working Nation, - he cried crocodile tears on one hand for the unemployed and on the other he was buckling to the unions-more money for people in work at the expense of people out of it. At the same time he was running this notion that you can put up the price of labour and not affect the unemployment rate. It is an inconsistent proposition. The honourable member for Hotham has not learned the simple equation that, when the cost of labour goes up, small business has a problem. When you add unfair dismissal legislation, as the previous government did, it was a disaster. But back to the simple equation: one man's pay rise is another man's job. Who said that? A former member for Melbourne Ports said that. Who was that? Mr Frank Crean, the member for Hotham' s father. The member for Hotham has not learned from his father's wise words. Turning to the measure itself and the philosophy behind it: it is rebuilding the work culture and the work ethic. But deeper still, it is the beginning of an overdue recognition that one has to put something back into the community when one is taking or receiving resources from it. Very few would argue against that proposition. I believe if you were in a small room on a one to one basis, very few would argue against it. It has been a very pleasing characteristic of the debate that diverse groups of people support it. Member after member on the government side, and several ministers, including the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), have recounted that support. Like those members, and many members opposite, I suspect, I am aware of many who have supported this measure, and that is the case in my electorate of Dickson in particular. I only wish to mention one who contacted my office. He lives in Kallangur in the Pine Rivers Shire. He declared at the outset that he was not a supporter of the government. He acknowledged that he was a paid-up member of the Australian Labor Party, but he told me in all sincerity that it was a long overdue measure that deserved the community's support. That is one among many comments, and members have recounted those comments. I was also interested to see the comments from some members of the Aboriginal community. One really worthy of note is that of Mr Colin Purcell, from Cherbourg, who put the debate in some perspective, vis-a-vis his people, and I respect this view. He said it has worked effectively in Cherbourg for years. I might add that the CDEP initiative, which is the work for the dole initiative in Aboriginal communities, was a Fraser government initiative and it has worked for nearly 20 years. His comment was that it was about time that the rest of Australia caught up with the Aboriginal communities. Recently I visited the old in the electorate of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). In relation to that visit, I have written to Senator Herron supporting proposals by the Aboriginal community for development of this site. Whilst there I inspected an Aboriginal cemetery that is located on land adjacent to the former mission site, a large parcel of land which is about 20 minutes from Ipswich. The cemetery itself was a bit run down and when I walked through the cemetery I observed the grave of that great Aboriginal singer, Harold Blair. His grave was in reasonable condition, but the cemetery itself could have done with some work. In my electorate there is a cemetery at Lawnton that is also partly run down. There is a cemetery at Samsonvale, not far from where I live, in a very beautiful part of the electorate adjacent to the dam. It is in pretty good shape; some graves are not in such good shape, but as families grow up and move and pass on, so graves fall into disrepair. What could be better than having the target group of young unemployed work on improving the state of some of these cemeteries? I think that most honourable members would be aware of decrepit and sad graves at cemeteries in their electorate, and it seems to me to be one area that is terribly neglected which could be addressed by these measures. Other projects have been suggested by community groups, and many are worthy. I am attracted to support for the elderly, in particular through Meals on Wheels, which is a great way of not only getting in touch with the elderly and infirm in the area but also helping young people realise that they are not the only ones who have problems. Just have a look at the way some of these elderly people are living, the loneliness and so forth. General maintenance around the homes of the elderly, such as mowing and gardening, helping out at old people's homes, helping out at nursing homes, just sitting with old people, talking with them, appreciating the wisdom that they possess-the wisdom of time-all of that could be a very positive aspect of this particular measure. Many people have other ideas that are equally worthy, but I mention those for the House's consideration in relation Purga mission site to this matter. I mentioned before about youth unemployment; that scourge is certainly deeply rooted in various parts of my electorate and at very high levels-approaching 30 per cent. About a year or so ago, Envoy John Tatters of the local Salvation Army church at a public meeting said that all of the problems at Bray Park-the juvenile crime, the wilful damage, the unfortunate assaults and break-ins and so forth that had occurred in the area and that were featured nationally at one stage in the lead-up to the election campaign-stemmed from one thing: youth unemployment. This measure, I believe, will help to restore a bit of respect by young people for themselves and, in tum, respect for others and for public property. I recall going to the Lawnton Guides hut recently for a function in my electorate and the hut was absolutely bedecked with hideous graffiti. The people at the hut told me that the building had been painted only the day before, which had cost the Lawnton Guides some substantial amount of money, and it had to be done again. It is that sort of thing that this measure is trying to redress overall in a philosophical sense-getting young people out there, getting them interested in something, getting them active. I have heard very few objections from the young people themselves about it. It is all very well to say the majority of the older people support it, but what do the young people say? It seems fairly clear that they support it. I was a bit disappointed with the honourable member for Lyons when he thought that the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) basically was taking a political line but dressing it up in another way. With respect, that is a slightly cynical view of the honourable member for Bradfield, whose sincerity in this House is unquestioned. There is politics in everything, so one can read that into everything, but I think the honourable member's contribution was a very sincere one and looked at some of the terrible problems that youth unemployment has brought to young people in the community. It is true to say that there are problems in our economy that do need addressing and that should be addressed. We have had movements in that respect in relation to small business, but we must also recognise that there are some endemic problems within the economy-the frightening pace at which the economy is changing and moving, a pace that none of us can easily cope with at times, and sometimes we really ask whether there is a chance with the pace of change. That pace of change is bringing with it some undesirable elements which tend to leave small business in a particular position that one could not say is positive for the future of small business. I refer very quickly in that respect to the rebate system. That rebate system is forcing more and more small businesses to the wall. As a chain, small businesses have the ability to buy in bulk, not that anyone store might sell more than a small business but, as a conglomerate, they sell more overall. However, the big chains take the normal discount offered by the supplier and, because of their size, demand a rebate percentage for volume, a percentage for advertising and a further percentage for greater volume. This is not achievable by small business. If you assume that this rebate plus advertising plus volume percentage adds to five per cent and the group turnover is $400 million per annum, this technically gives the big chains a windfall profit of $20 million. In fact, to achieve this volume, they can sell from 15 per cent down to cost, whereas a smaIl business can barely survive on cost plus 20 per cent. This means that the chains can at all times undersell the small business, and that is why small business is faIling by the wayside. We must recognise that. It is no good paying lip-service to the problems of smaIl business. While it is true that the government has reacted very positively to small business, we must look at underlying problems, and those underlying problems are of this nature. When you look at the size of companies like Email, James Hardie and Boral, these companies are now so diverse that they cover the spectrum. In Email's case, they cover everything that goes into the home except doors, and that is on the shopping list. This diversity aIlows them to use different divisions of their group to dictate to the market. If one section is showing a loss, this can be absorbed by other divisions. This in tum lets them control the market and keep competitors under control or run a competitor out of business. Boral has done the same in relation to the concrete block and brick business. This year Boral Timbers is prepared to take a $50 million loss to hold its market. This will lead to takeovers of smaller timber companies and the demise of those smaIler companies in the process. The same applies to Coles Myer and Woolworths. You have them as major shop tenants in every shopping centre. As they draw and pay less rent per square metre than the small retailer, they charge the supplier for shelf position, they demand cheaper prices for quantity sales improvement and, in tum, have meat, bakery, fish, salads, fruit, vegetables, chemist lines, make-up, et cetera-the list is endless. Outside their door, they have multiple small businesses paying top rents. Really, it is a deal that cannot continue. 'fl1e constituent, who wrote to me about this matter, said, 'When is small business going to get a level playing field? Small business employs people. If this inequitable system was scrapped, more jobs would be available to the unemployed.' He also quoted an example of Sony, which were fined by the Trade Practices Commission for suggesting that a major keep their prices up. The reason for this being so that small businesses could compete. So the system is against small business in many respects. We must recognise that in this debate about improving the lot of the unemployed and, ultimately, turning the economy around for the better. We must never lose sight of the fact that the economy is changing at this frightening pace. We as politicians must recall that along the way in trying to ensure that the system is improved for the better and young people are placed in work.",204
272,Mr ROCHER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"In an article published in the Australian last year, a journalist said: Great nations do more than enhance someone else's resources. They generate their own and then to enhance them too. While the journalist was referring to technical innovations, his comment, I believe, is also relevant to the human resources of industry. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill is about increasing the opportunity for young Australians to attain skills and attitudes that will make them more employable. The pilot program is designed to assist some 10,000 young adults to reach their full potential and to contribute to the betterment of the wider community. During debate on the Retirement Savings Account Bill 1996, I said in this place that the government was sending a strong message to the Australian people in introducing the concept of RSAs. I said then that the government was right to remind all Australians that a fully government funded old age pension should, and could, only be reserved over the fullness of time for those in real need. I suggested that it was to be hoped that the introduction of RSAs would see an increase in the number of people taking full responsibility for their own futures. In this way, the coalition's work for the dole scheme bears some resemblance to the concept of RSA's. Ideally, unemployment benefits should not be considered as unearned or an automatic entitlement. The principle behind the government's work for the dole scheme is a reasonable one. It is based on the notion that a more skilled and flexible work force will contribute to a more productive economy. If it is properly targeted and managed, it should empower many young Australians with greater knowledge as well as the necessary skills to access employment and to become financially independent. But the work for the dole scheme should not be regarded merely as an adjunct to economic objectives. It also aims to help impart a positive attitude to restore confidence and self-esteem by giving young people the chance to participate in projects of community work. The success of the scheme will largely be tested by the number of participants who do secure paid work as a result of their place in go on the program. Participants must gain experience in projects for which there are reasonable employment prospects, if work for the dole is to be anything more than a public relations gimmick. There is absolutely no benefit in funding a program to the tune of $13 million over the next financial year if participants do not have a likely chance of securing employment in the short to medium term. For this scheme to be of merit, it must have very clear social and economic objectives. As one analyst has observed 'there must be rewards in prospect before a personal commitment to a training program can be motivated' . Participants need to be confident that they are acquiring or enhancing skills that are relevant to the future work force. There has been some concern about the lack of private sector involvement in the proposed pilot program. Some have argued that for the scheme to have relevance to the knowledge and technology driven work force of the 21st century, industry needs to be closely aligned from the outset. Another analyst recently observed that the work for the dole scheme is 'essentially irrelevant to the huge and intractable task of reducing unemployment and coming to terms with the revolutionary changes created by technology, global competition and ideological fashion'. It is true that programs of this kind have seen an emphasis on low skilled jobs in the past. It is why the employment prospects for participants in the past programs have not been significantly enhanced. Professor Judith Sloan, an expert in labour studies, noted that it was not clear that former public sector job creation schemes 'had conferred valuable training and skill acquisition on the participants, apart from general work experience'. If the government is committed to providing real opportunities for the young long-term unemployed, it must keep Professor Sloan's enjoiner in mind. To date, the government has not used the program to deflect the focus from creating an economic environment conducive to wider employment growth. It will be, of course, lamentable if it falls into that trap given that the number of people claiming the news tart allowance and youth training allowance jumped to the highest level in 12 months in February of this year. The government must continue to recognise that this pilot scheme is not the answer to reversing the incline in structural unemployment in Australia. It is absolutely essential that the coalition continues to engineer an integrated policy framework that will encourage employers to invest, expand and engage additional staff. Professor Sloan argued several years ago now that the only long-term solution to unemployment is sustained private sector growth. In recent times, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has recognised that. Professor Sloan, not surprisingly, observed that the unemployment rate will not fall unless it is exceeded by a greater increase in the number of jobs created. The correlation between a steady growth in gross domestic product, an increase in private sector investment and improved employment levels made by Professor Sloan holds true today. There has been a good deal of media discussion of the proposed scheme. Most of it has been negative and much of it has been provocative. Some commentators have labelled the work for the dole scheme a containment strategy for youth unemployment, suggesting it is likely to suffer the same fate as former or like initiatives. The Australian in its edition of 12 March 1997 provided one of the more tempered commentaries on the program. It conceded that the scheme was likely to be of some merit if it was viewed as an adjunct to an integrated system of remedial training but stated: It will not produce real jobs or training for those 30,000 or so young people whom Mr Howard has identified as intractably unemployed. It argued that the work for the dole scheme should not be mistaken for 'a serious response to long-term youth unemployment'. As already indicated, neither the Prime Minister nor the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) have pretended that it will. The minister in his second reading speech said that the scheme aims to restore the self-esteem of our young unemployed while emphasising the need for the participants to give something back to their community. However, places in the pilot scheme will be made available primarily to 18to 24-yearolds who have been out of the paid work force for a maximum of six months. Given that the worse mainstream youth unemployment rate is amongst those aged 15 to 19 it appears that a substantial number will be excluded from the pilot programs. That is a significant shortcoming of the pilot scheme. The government has made it clear that the pilot program will be focused on regional areas where youth unemployment is above the national average. Several journalists have suggested that this will discriminate against the young people in these areas by forcing them to work for their unemployment benefits while those in metropolitan areas are not obliged to do the same. That argument misses the point of the scheme entirely. It is widely accepted that a well targeted program will produce a better result than a loosely targeted scheme. The impetus behind any training program should be to give workers skills and insights that make them more employable. The government is right to target regional Australia in this pilot program. What better way to monitor the outcomes of the program than by testing it in areas of high unemployment. The National Farmers Federation released a discussion paper in February this year. Amongst other things it noted: Young people living in rural and remote communities have been hard hit as a result of poor local economic conditions, narrowly based local labour markets and the need to increase their job prospects by moving out of their local environments. It is clear that the unemployed in rural Australia do not have the same access to education and training facilities as do their metropolitan counterparts. In other words, an already disadvantaged group is further disadvantaged simply because of their places of residence. The work for the dole scheme has the potential to change this if it is properly administrated and evaluated. The government has said it expects the program will better prepare young people for their entry into the labour market by exposing them to community work. Several independent commentators have questioned whether this approach is likely to pay dividends. They argue that the government should consider only structured, formal, educative programs to help reverse the trends in youth unemployment. However, the counter argument has been put by Mr Barry Maley, Senior Fellow of the Centre for Independent Studies, who has argued convincingly that informal or on-thejob learning programs are meritorious. He noted that 'watching and informal teaching beside experienced workers, being told to carry out a task by a supervisor, learning by job rotation' and 'the exchange of information and technique' were valuable methods for improving skill levels. Mr Maley made it clear that productivity is improved not just by the amount of education or training offered but by the quality of instruction. Mr Maley said the real question is one of determining those structural features of education training and industrial organisation that will contain the incentives for finding the approp!""iate types and mixes of education, training and work organisation most conducive to productivity. As someone who for half his working life had the responsibility of managing a work force numbering directly hundreds at times and, on peak occasions, thousands directly and indirectly, I am one of those who favours on-the-job training. Unfortunately, with the acquiescence of employers over the last 20 or 30 years, there has been a tendency for part of that training to be subcontracted out into T AFE colleges and the like. So the master tradesmen, the most experienced men and women in the work force, are not called upon to educate young men and women on the job. I guess that is the price of progress. I must say that I favour on-the-job training above all other forms of training if we are to secure worthwhile employees. Perhaps that is a hopeless dream given, as I say, what has happened in the name of progress. The Canberra Times, in its editorial of 14 March 1997, commented that the closer the pilot projects resemble 'real work' the better. It argued that similar schemes had been most effective when the communities involved 'retained control and ownership of the scheme, and so long as the work (was) sustained and has had a point and a purpose'. The government could do well to keep that in mind. It is unfair for critics of the work for the dole scheme to assert that the program is destined to fail when all the details are not yet known. The sooner the government outlines the basis on which people will be selected, and the number and type of projects to be included in the pilot, the better. The government has indicated that participants in the scheme will be required to work for maybe 2Y2 days each week for their unemployment benefits. There is nothing offensive or demeaning in this expectation. It is entirely consistent with the government's position on encouraging, say, self-funded retirement, and in expecting Australians to contribute to the cost of their aged care if they can afford to do so. In closing I would like to include another quote from Professor Sloan. She says: It is generally accepted that providing training courses to the unemployed will not of itself lead t.o job creation, and indeed part.icip-nts may exp-n­ ence high levels of frustratIOn If a related Job cannot be secured on completion of a training program. She continued: There needs to be an expansion of demand in order for the newly trained to find employment. The government is to be commended on actioning this initiative in a proper and timely manner. The work for the dole program is not going to be a quick fix solution to the significant long-term unemployment problems we face in this country. Young Australians participating in the program will still be expected to search for permanent paid employment but it is hoped that their chances of gaining satisfying employment will improve as a result of their participation in this training scheme. Further, there is a provision in the bill outlining the maximum number of hours a participant will be expected to work on a community project, to allow that participant adequate time to look for permanent paid work. A commitment has been given to evaluate the effectiveness of the work for the dole scheme sometime before details of the 199899 budget are outlined. Such an analysis is crucial to ensure that the program continues to remain focused towards those people who can most benefit from it. However, the government has not specified who will be responsible for this analysis, nor has it outlined the criteria against which the effectiveness of the program will be measured. In my opinion this information needs to be made clear well before the pilot program commences. On the whole the proposed scheme is fair and it is supportable. But it will only be effective in the context of a committed effort to lift this country's economic performance and consequent employment opportunities. Debate (on motion by Ms Jeanes) adjourned. NEW BUSINESS AFTER 11 P.M.  agreed to: That standing order 103 (new business) be suspended for this sitting. NA AMENDMENT (WORK FOR THE DOLE) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",208
273,Ms JEANES,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill has been introduced into this parliament in order to enable recipients of the newstart allowance to voluntarily participate in an approved work program or to be required by the secretary of the department to do so in order to continue to receive the allowance. It is fair to say that most of my constituents believe that the concept of people receiving unemployment benefits working in exchange for those benefits to be an equitable one. This is not a new idea. It has been around for many years, but the government believes that the support in the community now justifies its introduction. It is truly sad that we need a scheme like this one. As at February this year we have 946,589 people who are in receipt of unemployment benefits, who receive their income from the Department of Social Security in the form of a benefit rather than from somewhere else in the form of a wage or salary. Of course, these figures only relate to those people who are eligible for payment from the department. They do not include the many thousands of Australians who would like to find paid work but who are supported by someone else's income. The reality is that we do have over 900,000 Australians out of work and it is a sad reality that should give no-one in this House any satisfaction whatsoever. Each and every one of us as parliamentarians in this House, and in our former lives as employers or employees in the public or private sector, as union leaders or as business leaders, have to accept responsibility for this catastrophic situation. We should ask ourselves what else we could have done, and what more we can do, to increase employment. Those of you who sit opposite did not manage to reduce the opportunity for dependence on unemployment benefits for these Australians. My government is now coping with this, our single biggest challenge. r call the situation catastrophic because I believe that in a democratic nation employment is a fundamental component of citizenship. Employment not only is the place where we gain the resources to purchase the goods and services that see us through this life but it also provides us with social contact with our peers, with increased self-esteem derived from the opportunity to make a contribution to our society and with the opportunity to attain income security for our retirement years. At least 946,589 Australians are currently denied this basic component of citizenship. The concept that requires the legislation before this House contains some benefits for my electorate, and it is fair to say I had some concerns with its implementation and the possible implications for some of my constituents. As a member charged with the responsibility of representing the political rights 84,777 electors in the Kingston electorate in this House, my job is to go for the benefits of the scheme and protect them from any potential unintended consequences. The potential benefits of the scheme for my electorate are considerable. Adelaide's southern suburbs show signs of the wear and tear that has occurred over the years from the overuse of natural resources and the inability of the various levels of government to devote adequate human and financial resources to address the wear and tear. Sadly, unemployment rates in the south, which hover around three to four points above the national average, have contributed to an economic malaise across parts of my electorate. They have impacted through all levels of government, the private sector and on the morale of our people. For example, local government has been denied the level of rate revenue required to adequately maintain the area's parks and roadsides. The general appearance of some parts of the south contributes to a lower level of self-esteem than that which the area and its people deserve. The work for the dole scheme has great potential to assist in addressing this problem. I have held talks with the City of Noarlunga to encourage their interest in the potential that it holds for them. Their interest does not require much encouragement as they too are keen to see the visual amenity of our area improved and will eagerly participate in the scheme to do so if chosen by my government. The potential downside of the scheme has caused me considerable concern and I have expressed that concern to my party. My concern related to the entitlement to the allowance of two groups of people. First, I was concerned about the potential impact on those who were already taking charge of their situations and seeking to return something to a society which was underwriting their incomes for the period of their unemployment. Secondly, I was concerned about those who had been in the work force for many years and had already made a significant contribution to their society and who, through no fault of their own, had found themselves dumped of the on the unemployment heap years before they planned to retire. I would just like to say a few words about some of my constituents who are not in paid employment. A number of my constituents are already taking charge of their job seeking activities. They are not only fulfilling the requirements of the newstart activity agreement but making a contribution not so much in return for their payments but because they want to do something useful with their time and to make a contribution to their community. They do not want to sit around marking time until a paid job comes their way. I have in mind a number of young people who work in some of our local community centres to help those who come for fitness or craft classes, who come because they are active members of local environmental or community service groups or who just come for company. I have in mind one young man, who has not been able to get a job over the past seven years since leaving school, despite going through numerous training programs and work experiences. He not only helps out at the community centre throughout the week but has joined the management committee to represent the needs of local young people, many of whom are also unemployed. Many of my constituents are also recipients of allowances because they find themselves turfed out of a job after many years in the work force. Their dignity has already suffered beyond that which most of us in this House could personally understand. These people, in my view, do not deserve to be threatened with compulsory participation in the scheme. There are, however, some people across Australia who are receiving social security payments who are not entitled to them, and my electorate is not exempt from this problem. For example, one of my constituents came to see me because her ex-husband was not paying her child support on the basis that he is a recipient of an unemployment benefit from the Department of Social Security, yet he had signed an affidavit, which I have sighted, to the Family Court stating he was unable to have access to his children on the days and at the times previously ordered by the court as it interfered with his work as a taxidriver. The Department of Social Security has no record of any other source of income for this person. The work for the dole scheme will interfere with the comfortable arrangement that this social security recipient has arranged for himself. If he is required to turn up for work in order to receive his allowance, he will be forced to relinquish his payment because he cannot be in two places at once. Hopefully, we would then be able to arrange child support payments for his ex-wife. A further example was given to me by a small businessman who visited my office. He claimed that he has done everything he can to ensure that his office runs legitimately in terms of federal, state and local government requirements. He has, for example, installed expensive pollution control devices that are required under local government regulations for his type of business. As you can imagine, this has caused him some considerable expense, yet he claims some of his competitors are able to significantly undercut his prices because they have managed to avoid the responsibilities imposed on them by the City of Noarlunga. They are also avoiding their responsibilities in terms of the cost of employing people. My constituent claims that a few of his competitors are also undercutting him because they are employing people who receive unemployment benefits and that they are not declaring them as employees and, therefore, avoiding a range of taxation and other costs. He claims these companies are paying DSS recipients very low wages and are therefore able to avoid many of the legitimate costs paid by other businesses. The information has been passed on to the minister's office, and the Department of Social Security is currently investigating the claims made by my constituent. If these accusations are founded, including the work for the dole scheme as part of the activity test offers a further opportunity to catch these people out. I am very pleased with the result of the concern that I expressed to my party. The scheme, as I have suggested, has the potential to contribute to the elimination of social security fraud. More importantly, it has the opportunity to offer people who are in receipt of social security payments the opportunity to develop skills, to experience a work environment and to make a contribution to their communities. So we all have these positives as well as the fact that those who are already taking charge of their lives, and those who have already made a significant contribution over a long period, will receive appropriate consideration in return for their efforts. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the Hon. Dr David Kemp, deserves my particular acknowledgment and thanks for his assistance in addressing my concerns. The minister arranged a meeting with me and the department to discuss the guidelines that will be drawn up by departmental officers who are considering when allowance recipients should be required to participate in a work for the dole scheme. Those for whom I have expressed concern will be acknowledged by departmental guidelines as being a low priority for compulsory participation in the scheme and the departmental secretary will have discretion as to whether these people should be required to work at the expense of losing their payments. Most of us in this place will know of the difficulty dealing with government departments at times when departmental officers make mistakes in determining the entitlements of our constituents. My staff estimate that around half the workload in my office comes from constituents who have justifiable complaints about their treatment from government departments, particularly Social Security, the Child Support Agency and Austudy. Departmental officers are like everybody else, including parliamentarians-they make mistakes. I am therefore pleased that I and every other member of this House will have the opportunity to appeal to the departmental secretary on behalf of constituents who, we believe, have been caught up unfairly in the net. I am therefore comfortable in supporting this bill in the hope that the scheme it supports will contain some real benefits for my electorate and because it will not threaten to penalise those of my constituents who simply do not deserve to be penalised. More importantly, I hope in the not too distant future people in my area will benefit from the efforts of my government to increase employment. Our measures to assist businesses, particularly small businesses, were announced this week. They are designed to enable small business across Australia to employ more people. Nowhere in Australia is this more needed than in Adelaide's southern suburbs. Other measures designed to assist people in employment include improvements to education and training schemes to make them more flexible and more attractive to potential employers. Initiatives like the jobs pathway program and the modern Australian apprenticeship and training scheme are designed to achieve precisely that goal. Surely every member in this House would want to see that these programs and initiatives achieve their stated goals and get our unemployed people into new jobs. Only then can anyone in this place be proud of our efforts to represent our consti tuen ts.",211
274,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Last December I had produced a brochure aimed at young Australians who are seeking their first job. The brochure was to alert them to the dangers that they faced, to the exploitation that we all hear about almost daily from young people and their families, when young Australians are being asked to work for work experience-which turns out to be nothing more than free labour-when there was never a job, not even a reference and no training involved, and when young people are being asked to work for cash in hand, not to tell Social Security and not to pay tax. Exploitation is rife out there and it has got worse. My concern in the last 12 months with the so-called deregulation and industrial relations reforms that are taking place has been that the message going out is that it is open slather: you pay people as little as you can get away with because the government is not really interested in protecting them. The exploitation that is occurring is of concern, and it should be of even greater concern given this Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997. The fact is that historically young Australians that have been protected by their governments and their unions. Now the unions are under siege by the government and employers, and of course the government could not care less. What they are saying now is that 20 hours work is a real job. So the government is doing nothing. I circulated that brochure as widely as I could to try to alert young people, to try to give them some guidelines on what to ask when they are being interviewed: things to check, some phone numbers they could ring to find out what the award rates are, what the conditions might be and the minimum number of hours-all the things that adults would take for granted. The fact is that we are now producing a group of young Australians who are being taught to work in the worse possible way where they neither trust nor respect either the employer or the system. Work is no longer ennobling; it is disempowering and disabling. They are being asked to work the minimum number of hours for subsistence wages and they are also being asked to cheat. They see that what is happening to them is the opposite of what they imagined. Work for the dole is one of the most disgraceful things to do. One of the great things which the previous government did was to change the phraseology and the terminology by introducing news tart or by changing to jobsearch and so on, because we got away from the idea that income support was somehow the fault of those who needed it. If we were to project the same values on other groups in the community there would be an outcry. But we now have enshrined in the title of the bill effectively 'work for the dole'. It will be there forever and a day, and we have spent so long getting ourselves away from that 'dole bludger' mentality that we found so destructive, particularly in the early 1980s when it was used so heavily. We had just got rid of all that, and here it is brought back by a government elected with a strong majority which does not need to use that kind of nastiness in putting it into the title of a bill. It is unbelievable. I would not have thought it was possible, to be honest. Just over one year ago I would not have imagined that members of this parliament could so demean people who suffer unemployment. The people who will be most affected will include people who left school before gaining the school certificate. That means they may well be undereducated. They may not be all that literate. It will include people who may have a psychiatric disorder. The fact is that the median age of all psychiatric disorders which are diagnosed is 16. Half of the people who are diagnosed with psychiatric illnesses are under 20. So there is a fair chance that quite a few of these people may have some level of psychiatric disorder. It might not be diagnosed. In some cases it is not. It may be seen to be a behavioural problem. They may be difficult as young people and in years to come it will be uncovered that they actually did have a problem. Many of them may have been physically, sexually or psychologically abused. They may well have parents who have broken up. They may well have been in households where there was domestic violence. But all of them would like to have a job. All of them would like to have a decent income, to have some self-respect and to be able to have the things that most of us take for granted. Is that all that much to ask? It is not. This legislation will be understood by those young people in much the same way as it will be understood by those employers who will say, 'Look, I will give you $8 an hour, just do not declare it, or $6 an hour and don't pay tax.' In other words, that is the projection that we are giving these people in our society who have already been seriously disadvantaged, who have already been victims not simply of unemployment but, in so many cases, other things. They are victims before they start and they are victims again. They are being asked to enter a conspiracy with employers-to cheat. They are being told, 'If you want the job, shut up and take the money. Work the extra hours without overtime. You do not get the award rate. Do not expect penalty rates and all those things. Take the job or take the sack. If you want to work in my place, you do what I tell you. I make the rules, nobody else.' That is what they are getting now. Along comes a scheme and they are told, 'By the way, if you are getting social security, if you are getting income support, then you will be required to put in some time with somebody else.' That somebody else may be a well-meaning, wonderful organisation-and so many of our caring groups are-which has put forward a proposal in good faith because they may have fallen for the idea that somehow young people actually want to work for nothing. That is what it basically is. They are not working for the dole. They are actually working for nothing. To put it another way, they work for 14 hours and they do not get paid for the rest of the week. Either way, they spend a lot of their time working for nothing and chasing jobs for nothing. Within a reasonably short space of time those organisations that currently think this may be beneficial to their society and their organisation will find that they become the instrument to penalise and punish people who have already been victims and who are already disadvantaged. The anger and frustration that they will come across will surprise them. It will not surprise me. Having chaired a parliamentary inquiry into youth homelessness which travelled around Australia and talked to young Australians who were living away from home and, in many cases, are the people this scheme is aimed at, I can assure the organisations that these young people are angry, disenfranchised and alienated. It will not take very long for organisations to work out that they are being used by the government in a way that is not within their normal charter. This concept has been about for a very long time. For a very long time there has been perception in the community that this would be a good thing to do, that somehow it would actually help people get a job or whatever. When one has been through this in any form i.n the past, it has been recognised that those illusions fall away. I will take the example of what is being forward now. We are being told that people will be given $10 a week extra to help do a job. If you are talking about provincial Australia, where there is no public transport, what does it cost to get somewhere? We had enough difficulty with this with new work opportunities program where people were being paid $260 a week and found that the cost of transport which they had to pay out of this wage was very high. These people normally do not have transport and have use some form of paid transport. If you require transport two or three days a week, many cases $10 a week will not cover it. It might if there is a public transport system they can get cheap transport passes, but that applies in only a relatively small geographic part of the country. In an awful lot of Australscheme is these young people will be seriously out pocket. Mind you, they also have to to go and look for jobs at the same time. When they are not working for the dole they have to be out looking for work. One assumes that they will have to look for two, three, or five jobs a fortnight on top of their work for the dole contribution to society. One of the great ironies is that, if these young people were spending 12 hours a week or more in education, they would not be entitled to social security. I find it quite ironic that it is okay to go and meet visitors arriving at Mascot for 15 hours a week and still get social security, but it is not okay to go to TAPE 15 hours a week and still get social security. I find that conflict really quite distasteful. These young people need skills and training. They need selfesteem and support. What they are being given is a punishment to serve some time to make somebody somewhere feel better. Earlier today someone likened it to a chain gang exercise. It is a form of penal servitude a in the sense that these people will not feel any sense of worth in terms of so much that has been talked about. The example used by the government when it first announced the scheme of greeting tourists arriving at Mascot all would be one of the sillier things I have heard. It thinks that somehow this is going to put help young people, so many of whom in this age group are undereducated and have other them problems, become work competitive and regional and improve their self-esteem. The fact is that they will know, all their friends will know and everybody else will the know why they are there. This was not understood. The psychology of this is so disastrous in that respect. It is one thing for a person to volunteer to befriend an older person or someone with a disability. Many to young Australians are doing this now on a voluntary basis. That is terrific because it in really does them a lot of good and gives them a sense of worth. They are volunteering. They and do not need this legislation to do that. That can happen anyhow. But the fact is that the ones who are compelled to take part in this will know that they have been picked of out and stigmatised further, as will their families, their friends and people they come find the money in contact with. It is not enough for them not to be able to work or to be undereducated. It is not enough that they have to live on a lower level of four income than most of their colleagues. Now they are going to have a further mark against them because they are going to be part of this scheme. That will not help them grow. That will not improve their self-esteem: it will make them feel even worse. But, more importantly, it will make them feel more alienated and angry. One of the things that, as a parent, I have found so fascinating and so difficult is children's understanding of why things happen. The fact is that these young people are going to be punished and they will not know what they have done wrong. They will not know what their crime is. They have been looking for a job and they have not found one. They are going to be punished because there are no jobs for them. The tragedy of what is being put forward here is the psychological damage this will do not just to them but also to many others. So we will see a new form of underunderclass. We already have an underclass in the sense of people who cannot get work, and we are aware of that. We feel some sense of responsibility to those people because they are part of our community. Their parents, their grandparents, their brothers, their sisters, uncles and their aunties are all making a contribution, but they are not able to at the moment. We feel strongly and they feel strongly that we still have to see them as part of our community. This scheme is going to create an underunderclass who will be marked and made to do something, like it or not. At the end of that process, we know that they will be no better trained and their prospects of work will be no greater. Will prospective employers think that being forced to work for the dole will actually improve a person's capacity for work? Would a prospective employer say, 'This is great, you have been singled out'? Or will they ask, 'Why did they pick you? Why were you the one who had to do it? Of all the 900,000 out of work, why were you one of the 10,000 picked? What problems have you got?' The whole process of selecting people in this kind of way and giving them this kind of stigma will produce long-term damage. But the government believes it has strong community support. Working for the dole has been talked about for a very long time. We put forward a number of points to try and actually have a debate about this issue. We are not seeing those points being debated now. What we are seeing being debated is the prejudice against people who choose not to work. The 11 points that have been put forward would, if done properly, effectively recreate Working Nation. That will not be done; we know that. In Working Nation, the idea of reciprocal obligations meant both ways. It did not mean that if you get money you have to work for it; what it meant was that we are obliged to help all of those people who are out of work. The concept there was that there was a total obligation, not just to 10,000. Over the previous government's time frame, it would have affected all people. That is what reciprocal meant. It was not some emasculated version that referred to only 10,000 people in selected areas for part of the week, with no training or support, who would almost certainly be out of pocket as well. This whole process has been so driven by prejudice and populism it will be of interest their to us to see how many of the 11 points the government accepts. It will be of interest to me to see how many organisations in the community weigh into this debate and actually contribute to it in the way many of them can. There are a lot of organisations out there experienced in skillshare, in jobskills, in Working Nation and in new opportunity programs. They are experienced in helping the young and older long-term unemployed. I am looking forward to their contribution now that this legislation is in the open. I have no doubt that those organisations will share the same concerns that we have because they have worked very hard and learnt a great deal in recent years about helping to solve this problem. I do not think many of them are going to come forward to volunteer on the kind of basis that is being put forward. I do not think all that many of them are going to be excited about the government's proposals. It will be very interesting to see the differential. It will be interesting to see how many of the organisations that volunteer are new ones compared with ones that have previously been involved in Working Nation. I suspect that most of those who were involved in the previous programs will not volunteer so readily because they will understand both the dangers and the shortfalls. You cannot train people or give them self-esteem or substance in this kind of mickey mouse way. This scheme has not been designed to succeed; it has almost been designed to fail. That is the tragedy of it. It has been designed to stigmatise even further people who are already victims. It has been designed to use them like scapegoats so the government can parade-as they have done over the last year-about their savings. Every day we are all besieged by people who are helping the government save money: Austudy people, people on social security, pensioners-all kinds of people. They are all people who are helping to save money-and they are bleeding very badly. They are hurting very badly and they want to know what they have done wrong. The one I quoted last night, who is having his rent assistance cut, is saying just that: 'What have I done wrong? Why am I being punished?' This is another group being picked out and stigmatised. Weekly, we are seeing announcements from the government about their savings. But we are not seeing the effects on their staff. It would be interesting to note, in the last few months, how many people have been off ill in Social Security and the CES. They are the people at the coalface of this, the ones facing the brunt of this. Ask the local offices what has been happening. The people at the coalface, who are actually administering these schemes, are going down like ninepins right now. I know it and I am sure all the members of government know it as well. We will just have even more casualties with this scheme. Those 11 points have meaning and substance. It will be interesting to see how much the government and those in the community come in behind them. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr MCArthur) ;iJjourned. NA Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments, together with a message acquainting the House that the Senate had agreed to the following resolution: That the following matter be referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund for inquiry and report on or before the last day of sitting in 1997: The urgent need for amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, consistent with the report of the Review of that Act by Justice Elizabeth Evatt, in order to avoid or minimise the repetition of any further incidents, such as the Hindmarsh Island Bridge situation, in which the spiritual and cultural beliefs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are not able to be properly considered under existing legislative arrangements. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendments(1) Page 1 (after line 8), after clause 2, insert: 2A Racial Discrimination Act to prevail (1) For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly declared to be the intention of the Parliament that the terms of the Racial Discrimination Act shall prevail over the provisions of this Act. (2) Nothing in this Act shall be taken to authorise any conduct, whether legislative, executive or judicial, that is inconsistent with the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. (2) Clause 3, page 2 (after line 7), after the definition of pit area, insert: Racial Discrimination Act means the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.",214
275,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I move: That the amendments be disagreed to. The legal advice that the government has is that this bill is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, that it is not retrospective and that there are no substantive grounds that could lead it to being declared invalid. It is a requirement of the act that another report be prepared, given that Justice Mathews's appointment to prepare the previous report on 1996 the matter, the fourth report, was found to be invalid. Legal action has recently been commenced to force the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) to appoint another section 10 reporter. This action is likely to succeed if it continues. That would result in the preparation of a fifth report, costing up to $1 million and wasting considerably more time. Given the history of litigation surrounding the bridge, there would be no guarantee that another report would lead to a finalisation of the matter. However, the action has been discontinued pending the passage of this bill, but it is understood that the action will recommence if the bill is not passed by the end of this fortnight's sittings. So we now have a window of opportunity to finally pass this bill and end the very long history surrounding the conflict. However, the government will accept the bill only in its original form. It cannot accept the amendments moved by the opposition in the Senate. It is our view that the only consequence the amendments will have is to create legal action which is likely to fail but which will take expenditure of considerable additional money and cause a further substantial delay to the building of the bridge. The bill in its original form will end this once and for all, consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, and we would hope to have the support of the opposition in this.",218
276,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"Banks) (11.12 p.m.)What a disgraceful performance by this government. What weasel words were just uttered by the minister at the table, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). This shows that this government is not fair dinkum. When put to the test, it will fail every time. This bill passed through the Senate with an amendment-an amendment that on the government's own legal advice will not stop the building of the bridge. We have had this bill passed today in the Senate, a bill that authorises the bridge to be built. You asked for it; you got it. That is what you wanted. Your time's up. That is what you wanted. You said you needed this bill for the building of the bridge. If you play games with this in the parliament, it proves that your objective is not to build the bridge but to divide the community, to continue the politics of division in the community in the vain hope that you will get votes. It is a disgusting performance. The government stands condemned. The government's own legal advice, not the advice that the opposition has received, came from Mr Burmester, Chief General Counsel. Remember him? He is the legal advice you rolled out on the same day in relation to the CASA situation and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). And what does Mr Burmester say? Does Mr Burmester say there is any impediment to the bridge proceeding immediately? On 29 November last year the following dialogue took place: Senator BOLKUS: Is there any decIaration or order in existence at the moment that would prevent construction of the bridge? Mr Burmester: No. Senator BOLKUS: So if the bridge construction started tomorrow and an opponent of the bridge construction sought a protection order under section 10, there is nothing in the legislation that would compel the minister to issue that protection orderwhich is basically paraphrasing what we just said? Mr Burmester: That is right. CHAIR: Does Boobera Lagoon provide a precedent for this? Mr Burmester: That case confirms the earlier decision in Wamba Wamba, that the minister cannot be compelled to make a particular decIaration. So all the government's advice, when the right questions are asked, is that this bridge can be built even without this legislation. There is no impediment to building this bridge, but the government sleazes in here yet again, trying to further divide the community. What does the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) say in relation to his commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs? 'We will respect the Racial Discrimination Act.' He repeats it in the parliament. He repeats it outside the parliament. The government accepts an amendment to another bill in the Senate in relation to social security-that is, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. It is the same amendment. It accepts it in the Senate. It accepts it in the House in relation to migrants but not in relation to this bill. Oh, no. It could lead to further litigation. You cannot have your cake and eat it too. That is what you want. You want to say, 'Trust us,' but at the first opportunity you weasel it; you wimp it. It is a disgrace. The bridge could have been built the minute you were elected to government. The heritage protection act is only any good if you want to stop construction of the bridge, not if you want to allow construction. The minister has complete discretion. This bridge could have commenced last year. That is what your legal advice says. That is what the courts have confirmed. The absolute discretion is in your minister. You have the hide to come in here and say, 'This is consistent with the RDA,' yet when we put up an amendment that is agreed to by the Senate that will allow construction of the bridge you wimp it. You wimp it because you are not fair dinkum. This is the lowest form of politics. Both sides of this parliament need to send a message to the community that we will respect the Racial Discrimination Act. (Time expired)",219
277,Mr FILING,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I said when the member for Banks (Mr Melham) came in that we were going to be subjected to more deja vu. In fact, if we listen carefully, his speeches are all the same. They have been the same each time. Each time we have covered the same argument, and now we find ourselves in exactly the same position the House of Representatives was in the last time we debated this. We are faced with amendments that have been passed in the Senate but which are clearly unacceptable to the government, and quite rightly so. In my view, the opposition once again is perpetuating one of the greatest forgeries and frauds in modem Australian history. I made the comment the last time. I addressed the House on this matter that this resembled the Zinoviev letter as being one of the great political forgeries of our times, perhaps of the 21st century, as far as Australia is concerned. I would like to make an observation. It is interesting that we are now debating amendments that relate to the Racial Discrimination Act, yet nobody has actually bothered to chase up the cause of all this in the first place-that is, the forged women's business documents. They were clearly forgeries. They were found to be false. They were tendered to trigger a declaration by the then shadow minister, the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), and he was thrown out on his ear by election time. The member for Banks is making political points in his speeches. This is a political tactic. It is part of a strategy that was commenced to destroy in the first instance the career of the member for Barker. It failed. It succeeded in giving him a substantial injury, but it relied on the use of forged documentsdocuments that did not have any substance in fact and that were created in order to mislead those who had an interest in the matter and, in the first instance, that poor fellow who was at that stage the shadow minister. I want to make an observation about this. At a time when we are debating once again these amendments-the same ones that were proposed by the member for Banks the last time we were debating this-we still have as the prime mover for the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair a set of documents that were forgeries. The members of the Labor Party who perpetuated this fraud are accomplices, because they have been part and party to this great fraud that was perpetrated on the Australian public and has resulted in this absolute travesty of justice where we find ourselves still unable to construct the Hindmarsh Island Bridge because of",220
278,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,Your Prime Minister's words can't be trusted. You still carry a Liberal Party ticket. That's your problem.,220
279,Mr FILING,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"Listen, if I were an accomplice to this type of forgery, I would hang my head in shame. The member for Banks would do well to reflect on the factMr Martin Ferguson-We know all about forgery on the other side of the House, don't we?",220
280,Mr FILING,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"The member for Batman was not here at the time. He is a newcomer to the place. I think he would be embarrassed if he actually knew the facts behind the case. He would certainly be embarrassed if he knew that we are still faced with the fact that the forged documents have never been properly investigated. I put it to the Federal Police that they ought to be investigating this matter as a serious matter of forgery and fraud. This was perpetrated in the first instance as a result of a decision by the previous Bannon and Arnold Labor governments in South Australia. In fact, the attitude changed towards the Hindmarsh Island Bridge on the election of a Liberal government in South Australia. It is ironic that the member for Barker was opposed to the construction of the bridge, but he took on this matter because he felt strongly that there was a principle involved. At the conclusion of his first efforts, he found himself in the position where, as a result of the forged documents, he was obliged to resign his position as shadow minister. In conclusion, may I make the observation that here we are once again dealing with this particular business. These are amendments that were proposed by the opposition and obviously carried in the Senate that would clearly allow for greater legal challenges to delay the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. All I can say is that, in common sense, let us get this matter finished. Let us forget about these amendments. Let us get the Hindmarsh Island Bridge under construction after all these years and all the expense. All we have seen as a consequence is more and more fat QCs enriching themselves at the expense not only of the South Australian public-which obviously through the South Australian government has a substantial liability in this matter-but also of the unfortunate Mr and Mrs Chapman, who were the developers in the first instance.",220
281,Mr ROBERT BROWN,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,I am horrified to think it can be seriously advanced that the overturning of the Racial Discrimination Act should be undertaken simply because there might be some litigation involved. What is new? We live in a world of litigation. We live in a world of fat cats who contribute towards all of the legal processes. Why then do we have to discriminate against Aboriginals in connection with this question?,221
282,Mr FILING,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,Rubbish.,221
283,Mr ROBERT BROWN,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"The member for Moore says, 'Rubbish.' Let me say that I have been much more impressed by the passionate and principled concern that has been expressed by my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I have been, as I have said, horrified at the suggestion that, despite the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself has said that his government will respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, the government proposes to do no such thing. As the member for Banks has quite clearly indicated, and as everyone knows, the bill was passed in the Senate. The essential provisions of that bill were passed in the Senate. There are many contentious continuing issues. Let me say I am not satisfied with all of those questions which, for example, the member for Moore would claim have been resolved. I am not satisfied that they have been, but I am prepared to leave that aside. Let me make this perfectly clear. I am not prepared to leave aside the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act; nor should this parliament, this government, the ministers or the Prime Minister. It is as simple as that. The Hindmarsh Island Bridge, for whatever reasons, can be built. The bill has been passed in the Senate. The provisions exist. All we are doing now is suggesting that the principles of the Racial Discrimination Act should be honoured as well. The member for Banks referred to the Burmester advice. The government would be well advised to be conscious of that advice and to act accordingly. The Senate amendments simply seek to ensure that the parliament itself will respect the provisions of a piece of legislation for which this parliament is responsible, and the parliament seeks to tum its back on that.",221
284,Mr CAMPBELL,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,Shame.,221
285,Mr ROBERT BROWN,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"It could be. I respect the opinion of the member for Kalgoorlie. He says shame on the parliament for passing that legislation. But I know that the member for Kalgoorlie has sufficient respect for this institution and for its processes to acknowledge that, once the legislation is passed, the parliament itself should be sufficiently responsible to acknowledge that legislation and to act honourably in relation to it. I repeat the point that I made before: there are many continuing, contentious and unresolved questions about this. I think, and everyone would agree, that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge incident or affair-whatever you like to call it-has been one of the most unfortunate things to have occurred. It has been one of the most public. It has been one of the most obvious. It has been one of the most recognised, understood and acknowledged. It is a very unfortunate incident. But I am not convinced that the issues concerning that case have been resolved. It is not possible for me to get into the minds, the hearts or the souls of those people who made certain claims which some subsequent inquiries have upset.",221
286,Mr FILING,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,They found they were forgeries.,222
287,Mr ROBERT BROWN,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,The member for Moore says they found they were forgeries. This parliament found in favour of the Racial Discrimination Act.,222
288,Mr CAMPBELL,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,What point are you making?,222
289,Mr ROBERT BROWN,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for that question. The point that I am making is that this parliament passed the Racial Discrimination Act and now seeks to offend against it. That is the point that I am making. It is a very unfortunate development. I think it is a very unfortunate reflection on this parliament, on the government and on the processes of this place. The sooner the government acknowledges that the bill was passed in the Senate and that these amendments simply seek to honour and respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, the sooner the government will be much better placed. The sooner that happens, the better. (Time expired)",222
290,Mr CAMPBELL,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"After being so grievously misrepresented by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) I feel I really have to say something. I can assure the member for Charlton that I do not hold the behaviour of this House in any great high regard. I want to address my comments tonight to logic, so I hope you will not rule me out of order in speaking to this bill, Mr Deputy Speaker. I believe that the Burmester opinion was accurate. It was also clearly believed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) in the Senate who said exactly the same thing. I asked a question of the Prime Minister, John Howard, and he could not answer it, because I believe John Howard knows as well. We have heard the earnest and eloquent waxing of the member for Banks (Mr Melham), and the member for Banks ought to ask himself this question: if, as he believes, the bridge can go ahead and be built without this legislation, what on earth is the logic of attaching to it the Racial Discrimination Act? There is clearly no logic in it. He believes it can go ahead without this legislation. To the member for Charlton, I would say this: to attach the Racial Discrimination Act to this legislation clearly opens the way for litigation. It will be paid for out of the public purse and the Aboriginal Legal Service will pursue it. Attaching this. clause clearly gives them the ground to do it. The Liberal Party, or at least their leaders, know that the bridge can now be built without this legislation, but they know that if this amendment is attached to the legislation it will give grounds for more and more litigation. The Labor Party clearly believes it can be built without this legislation, but they want to put into it something which will cause litigation. That really is illogical. I think this House ought to consider that. I think the member for Banks is being vexatious. Although I am sure he is being righteously vexatious, he is vexatious nonetheless. I believe these amendments should be rejected. We should get it back to the Senate and tell the Senate that it is about time it acted with some integrity, unlike their recent deliberations on the Euthanasia Laws Bill.",222
291,Mr LINDSAY,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I approach will spend just one minute saying that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) is somewhat off the track. I suggest to you, that no act or legislation of this parliament sacrosanct. Probably the most in this parliament-the constitution of this country-is open to amendment. The member for Charlton should take note of that. If it is in the interest of the people of Australia to amend the Racial Discrimination Act, it should be amended.",223

What we are doing tonight is invoking an interestcan ing and novel principle.

If one looks",223

296,Mr HOLDING,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I am talking about a legislation principle. And the honourable member is so elegantly dressed-he looks beautiful, distinlenges guished and the best I have ever seen him look. I am almost ready to bow to you, you look so great. But I want to say this: if the parliament adopts this principle, every time it passes a piece of legislation we will have to ple. have an amendment because somebody might challenge it. That is a very interesting cept. We have just passed legislation which to people's rights to receive their compensaside tion-you can call it a surcharge or a levysubsequent and there are a lot of people who are going be very unhappy about that. Do we say, 'We also need to put in a rider that says there will not be any legal challenge to this'? That is very dangerous precedent. And I find it to interesting that, whenever this sort of novel is taken, it is not against the big end of town that we heard so much about earlier this week. It is being taken in respect of a sir, group of Aboriginal people who mayor may is not have a right to challenge. That is a matter important act of deep concern. If we as a parliament say, in respect of legislation which we have passed which confers rights on people, 'This might be subject to some kind of legal challenge down the line: we presume that challenge and will therefore add a rider to this legislation, so that cannot be challenged', then that is a unique on and very odd principle. And if we adopt it for this legislation, we are going to create a very interesting precedent which I do not believe live within the framework of a parliathis ment, in respect of its own legislation. You cannot say 'We will pass one piece of legislation but, because there may be a legal challenge, we will add a rider-designed to prevent any legal challenge-to this legislation.' If that is good enough in respect of Hindmarsh Island Bridge-where there is a clear power to go ahead and build it-why, when you pass some tax legislation, is it not good enough to add a rider saying, 'This legislation cannot be subject to legal challenge'? Where does it end? In my view, as a principle and as a precedent, it is a very dangerous concept to say, 'We will pass this and, because of the history of this and the fact that there have been legal chalin the past, we are going adopt the principle, to ensure that legislation which confers rights in respect of the Racial Discrimination Act cannot be used in any way at all to justify a legal challenge. I reject the princi",223
297,Mr MCCLELLAND,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I stand in support of the amendments. The member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), brief goes as he was before being gagged by his own it appeared, is absolutely dead right. A act of parliament unquestionably to overrides an earlier act of parliament, to the extent of any inconsistency with that earlier act of parliament. And, in so far as the Hinda marsh Island Bridge Bill 1996 was determined be inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, it most certainly would be found to override the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act to the extent of that inconsistency. That is what this amendment is directed to. But it is directed to preserving the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act in circumstances where the act's very principles and moral foundations are being challenged by virtue of a completely meaningless and academic act-namely, the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act. There is absolutely no need for the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act. There is no impediment whatsoever to the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. Former minister Tickner's decision to make a declaration under section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 was set aside and killed dead. It is gone, it is non-existent and it has vanished. Mr Charles- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I point out to you that this debate is about the amendment to the bill, and not about the bill or the actions of the former minister.",223
298,Mr MCCLELLAND,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I am addressing the question. It is fundamentally important for the amendments to go through, because they facilitate the challenging of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996 in so far as the provisions of that bill are inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. I am saying that is appropriate, and it is appropriate because the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill is a completely useless bit of legislation. It is a waste of time. It is a of the shelf space in the Table Office. It is meaningless because former Minister Tickner's decision is dead, gone, kaput. One level of the Federal Court dismissed it, rejected it, and said it was incorrectly made. That decision was appealed by former Minister Tickner to the Full Court of the Federal Court and they dismissed the appeal. Former Minister Tickner's decision is dead, gone. Former Minister Tickner then attempted to resurrect the procedure by appointing Justice Jane Mathews to report to him for the purpose of his determining whether to make a decision under section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, but that decision was challenged as well. The High Court set aside the appointment of Justice Jane Mathews because it was inconsistent with the division or separation of powers between an administrative act and a judicial purpose, Justice Mathews being a judge. So all the procedures of Minister Tickner were set aside, dead and gone. My personal view is that, if I had been on those courts, I would have determined that as well because he made a decision which was based on information not available to him, namely, this secret women's business. The courts all said, 'You can't make an administrative decision based on appropriate reasoning processes if you don't have the facts to undertake that reasoning.' Hence, they set aside the decision. In my view, they were right in setting aside the decision, but in any event it has gone. This Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill is a completely useless and wasteful piece of legislation. If it is found to override fundamental principles and rights as contained in the Racial Discrimination Act, the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill itself should go because of the fundamental risk it poses to those principles.

299,Mr ALBANESE,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I am quite pleased tonight to rise in support of the shadow minister, the member for Banks (Mr Melham), and the amendments which have been put forward to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill. I spoke some months ago, or at the end of last year when this bill was presented to this House, on a waste number of occasions. The position that the opposition put forward at that time has been shown to be correct, that is, this is nothing more and nothing less than a shabby exercise in politics. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) knows, as the government knows, that there is no impediment to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge proceeding. There is no impediment to the building of that bridge except for the decisions which are up to the developers in this case. The issue which we have tried to bring out in moving these amendments, and which the Senate has supported in their adoption of these amendments, is very clear, that is, we do not think it is appropriate that this parliament in 1997 be about legislation which could be viewed as being in contradiction of the Racial Discrimination Act. If you have a look at the amendment which has been put forward now to this bill, and which the government are objecting to, it really is an extraordinary situation. They are saying yet again that they will discriminate, or be prepared to discriminate, against that section of our society which is the most discriminated against in Australia today, let alone in our history. I am not surprised really. I should not be surprised that the government is engaging in this shabby political exercise because it is consistent with one thing and one thing only, that is, this is a poll driven government. Where the substance of the need for legislation comes in contrast to the political imperative of the latest poll from Robert Menzies House, the political imperative will always prevail. We all know that there is no need for this bill at all, as the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) articulated in his address before the House tonight. So, in those circumstances, we are not only pursuing the bill but the government is prepared to go to the wall over these Senate amendments. It really is an extraordinary situation. I was listening to AM the other morning and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was talking about indigenous issues, in particular about the Wik decision. It was interesting because when he spoke on radio, when he spoke about the pastoralists or other interests, he spoke directly to them. He said, 'And I say to the farmers,' or 'I say to you.' He is very good at the medium of radio. But, when he spoke about indigenous people, he spoke about them in the third person. He spoke about 'them' and 'they'. They are not one of us. Mr MCClelland-They are not mainstream Australia.",224
300,Mr ALBANESE,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"They are not part of mainstream Australia as far as this government is concerned. It is consistent with the political line which is being run on the Wik decision. It is consistent with the political opportunism that this shabby bill and the government's intransigence on these amendments represent because, when the government talks about representing all of us, all those sections of our society who are most discriminated against know that it is certainly not talking about them, let alone for them. The position which was put forward was exposed by the way the Prime Minister spoke, was exposed by the fact that the Prime Minister today could not answer a question from the member for Banks that it is a bit inappropriate to show young kids, black and white Australians, fighting in an ad. It was a very simple full toss from the member for Banks today to the Prime Minister. All he had to do was hit it, but he exposed his hypocrisy today. (Time expired)",225
301,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"Let us be clear about one thing. I took advice to the shadow cabinet back in September that said there was no impediment to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge being built if the federal government and the South Australian state government wanted to build it. That is what I took to the shadow cabinet in September. That is on the public record. What we have had since is a debate about procedure, a debate about process. I personally think it is madness to build a bridge, but my personal consideration is irrelevant. I have been out to the Hindmarsh Island area. It will be a bridge to nowhere. It is a waste of money for the South Australian government. But the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill is before the House not because it is necessary to build the bridge-and, if it is, it has already passed the Senate-but because the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) wants to make a point because he. had to resign as shadow minister. The position is this: it is the government that says the bill is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. It is the government and the minister that gives us this assurance. What do they do? Mr Sinclair interjecting",225
302,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"At the first test, they reject our amendment. Let us be clear: this bill could have passed through the Senate ages ago with cross-party support for this amendment, but the government will not accept it. What happens? There is hypocrisy. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who is out of his place, says we are provoking. Of course I am provoking, because we have a Prime Minister and a government that say one thing and do another. Weasel words. They were not weasel words when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was the Leader of the Opposition back on 5 June 1995, when he made probably the best speech he has ever made on race when the grave of Eddie Mabo was desecrated. The Prime Minister said: There is no place in Australia for racial intolerance, there is no place in this country for people who peddle racist bigotry and there is no place in Australia for people who would seek to treat one Australian as less important or less deserving of a place in the Australian sun than other Australians. Further on, he said: I would hope the best messages all of us can convey to those who peddle racist bigotry is to treat them in the fashion that is most effective and to treat them and brand them as moral outcasts of our society. I think in that way we will mark our commitment as a people to a tolerant, harmonious Australia in which all Australians, irrespective of their backgrounds, are equal and entitled to be treated with equal dignity and respect. But they are weasel words when it comes to action. When it comes to this very important principled amendment, which is a safety net that says, This national parliament does not want to pass racist legislation, it does not want to pass legislation that might be in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act,' the government squibs the first test in relation to Aboriginal people-although not in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment BilI with the same amendment. We are saying tonight that this is a stunt by this government. There is nothing stopping this bridge being built. There has not been one line of advice contrary to that from the government's advisers in relation to the current position. When Mr Burmester, Chief General Counsel, was asked the questions, he answered quite correctly. In the current climate, with the National Farmers Federation running around peddling misinformation with their as, why shouldn't we pass an amended bilI like this to send a signal to the rest of community? We won't, we can't, because the government does not have confidence in its own legal advice or in the undertakings given by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) that they will respect the Racial Discrimination Act. That is what this is about tonight-a game. This is a game by the government to continue to put Aboriginal people up there for political purposes. This is the lowest form of politics. (Time expired)",225
303,Mr CAMPBELL,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I rise to speak again in this debate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge BilI as several things have been mentioned that have to be clarified. This bilI has absolutely nothing to do with Aboriginal welfare or interests. It is a bilI that deals with elitist interests. That is really beyond dispute. One of the reasons I find it difficult on occasions to take this parliament seriously is that, if this bill does not go back to the Senate tonight, it will not be processed in the Senate until the August session. The great loser in that will be the Labor Party, because the people out in the community will say that the Labor Party stopped the process of this bill. When the Labor Party knows that the bilI is not necessary, it is nonsense for them to be putting up this amendment. Quite clearly, one has to ask who is doing strategies for the Labor Party as they are so dam stupid. I have heard so much in this House about integrity, probity and all that sort of stuff. It is a nonsense. There is hardly any of that on either side. But it is quite clear that the public will be holding the Labor Party responsible for delaying this bill. The Labor Party ought to realise that and ought to be cooperating with the government to get this legislation through as quickly as possible.",226
304,Mr ROBERT BROWN,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"There are only a couple of issues that have been raised that I want to address. One of them involves interjections which may not have been picked up by Hansard but which I clearly heard. One, for example, was made when the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) was referring to the question of litigation. The member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) interjected and said, 'Vexatious litigation.' It could well be, but if we were to take out of the whole court system all the vexatious litigation there would not be much left. The proposal is that the vexatious litigation be taken out of the court system if it relates to Aboriginal rights. We also had a reference, again from the member for Melbourne Ports, that this is not a matter which relates to the big end of town. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) interjected and said it is about the big end of town. That is turning sanity on its head. Suddenly the Aboriginal community have become the big end of town? I have heard expressions of this kind before and we know that expressions of that kind, related to circumstances of that kind, are simply designed to discredit them. I think it is going to make very interesting reading when people have the opportunity to go through the Hansard and see what has been said by members on the government side and members on the opposition side in connection with this matter. I refer as well to the brief contribution made by the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) when he said that the Racial Discrimination Act should be amended. Well, perhaps it should be, but if it should be amended, amend it; don't override it. That is precisely what this legislation is designed to do. What we attempted to do in the Senate, and which, with the good will and support of other conscientious and principled members of the Senate, we were able to do, was ensure that this legislation would not be able to override the Racial Discrimination Act, an act which was put into place by this parliament. If it needs to be amended let's be honest and let's amend it, but while ever it is in place let's apply it, honour it and respect it. One of the things which has become perfectly and increasingly apparent in connection with this matter is that if it concerns Aboriginal rights you can get it in your sights. They used to get Aboriginals physically in their sights over the last 200 years but now we take a different tack. We don't now put them physically in our sights but if it concerns rights you can get it in your sights. I think the whole thing has been absolutely appalling. I emphasise again, as the member for Banks (Mr Melham) has, that the legislation has been passed by the Senate. It was recognised that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge could be constructed-and I echo the reservations the member for Banks has about that bridge, but that is apparently a matter for private interests to pursue for whatever purposes they see fit. The bridge can be built and the government should not, in the way it has chosen to, build into its own legislation provisions which make it perfectly clear and explicit that the purpose of those provisions is to override legislation in other forms. I refer, of course, to the Racial Discrimination Act. It is a sorry day when this government adopts approaches of that kind. It is appalling. The government stands condemned, and I condemn as well some of those unfortunate expressions, comments and statements that have been made in connection with this. It is on the record; it will not read very well.",226
305,Mr BARRY JONES,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"Let me just restate the situation in the context of the amendments to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill put in by the Senate. What they do is look at this very narrow and specific bill, a bill which in the view of the opposition-and I think it is universally recognised-does not need to be introduced at all. I do not think there is very serious dispute that the minister has the jurisdiction and authority to order the procedure of continuing the bridge. It is agreed to by the South Australian government; it is supported by the federal government and, in this case, it has been indicated that the opposition won't oppose it. But in this very narrow bill, which does have the effect of explicitly circumscribing the Heritage Protection Act, the opposition and the smaller parties in the Senate felt that it was worthwhile to make sure that, although the Heritage Protection Act might be cut back to a degree, the broad act of public policy which deals with relationships with the Aborigines, namely the Racial Discrimination their Act 1975, ought to have its pre-eminence restated. The normal procedure which other members referred to tonight is that later legislation is always taken as derogating from the earlier legislation to the extent that there is an inconsistency. All that this amendment proposes is to make sure that the original legislation, the broad act of public policy, the basic law which has essentially been unchallenged since 1975-that is, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975-is restated. The operation of this unnecessary legislation is not to be taken as cutting back the application of the Racial Discrimination Act in the same way that there has been a cutting back of the role of the Heritage Protection Act. I will read the amendment. The first amendment, under the heading '2A Racial Discrimination Act to prevail', states: For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly declared to be the intention of the Parliament that the terms of the Racial Discrimination Act shall prevail over the provisions of this Act. In other words, although the Racial Discrimination Act broad policy framework is a prior act and this unnecessary legislation, the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996, is a later act, the effect of our amendment is to just make sure that the original base act of 1975 remains. It goes on: (2) Nothing in this Act shall be taken to authorise any conduct, whether legislative, executive or judicial, that operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. Then the second clause simply says, and it is a matter of definition: Racial Discrimination Act means the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Is it the intention of the government to take a second step, of which this might be the first, to destroy the Racial Discrimination Act, to tum back the clock 21 years so that a piece of legislation, that we have very good reason to be proud of, is simply removed? I say it to the government: you may go through the attempt, but you will not get it through the Senate. The Senate has indicated very clearly that it wants the provisions about the Racial Discrimination Act, and the fact that it will prevail over this legislation, to remain. I say to the government: if this is the kind of legislation that you might be thinking of one day as a double dissolution trigger, then that would be a black day for the political process in Australia-an appalling day and a day that we would all regret; a day that we would find bitterly divisive in Australian policy. There are plenty on the government side who would regret it. There are plenty of major public figures associated with the Liberal Party who have been glad to endorse the Racial Discrimination Act and do not want to see it overturned. That is why the symbolism of it is tremendously important. (Time expired) Thursday, 27 March 1997",227
306,Mr HOLDING,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"The issues here are simple. First of all, no one on the government side can seriously contest that you do not need legislation to go ahead tomorrow, next week or whenever the government chooses to build the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. That is the first fact. The second fact is that if one looks at the history of this issue, I think it would be a fairly long shot for anybody to issue a further legal challenge. The next point is why bring in legislation that you do not need and then try to exclude a piece of very important legislation which the Senate has said quite clearly should not be the subject of reference, in respect of a bill that you do not need, to exclude what is, in my view, legally, a very is inconsistetlt with the long shot? This legislation is unnecessary. If you want to build the bridge, go ahead and build it. But my colleague the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has just pointed out that the Senate has made its position clear, and I support that position. I do not believe that the Racial Discrimination Act, an act of this parliament, can be turned on and off like a tap because somebody on the other side, or the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan), as a result of the history of this, has got some hurt feelings and says, 'In order to prove I was always right, anyway, what we have to do is amend a piece of this parliament's legislation,' even though the Senate has said you will not do this thing. If you want to go ahead and build the bridge, for God's sake do it, but do not interfere with the legislation of this parliament, which is the important legislation, which is under a lot of attack at the moment, particularly by some leaders on the other side who ought to know better. While talking about the fact that they do not believe in any form of racial discrimination, they attack this legislation on almost a daily basis and misinterpret with great deliberation the judgments of the High Court in the Wik case. We have had enough of that. Therefore, I say, if you want to build the bridge, go ahead and do it, but leave the Racial Discrimination Act alone. I adopt the arguments of my colleague, the member for Lalor: the Senate has made its position clear and the Senate is right. If you want to build the bridge, get ahead and do it.",228
307,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"In summing up for the opposition, I endorse the comments of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) that there is nothing stopping this bridge being built. I have just received a message that the Senate is now into its adjournment debate. This has been a political stunt by this government. They have had their legislation passed with the Racial Discrimination Act amendment, which their own legal advice says does not affect this legislation. Yet we have had this charade. Why? Because this government is not interested in building this bridge. They want this totally unnecessary legislation in the parliament to prove a point for the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan). But I make this prediction: if this bill passes the Senate, either with the amendment on the Racial Discrimination Act or unamended, it will be subject to challenge. It will be subject to challenge on constitutional terms that I think are highly likely to succeed in the High Court of Australia. What we will have is this Prime Minister (Mr Howard) emulating his hero, Sir Robert Menzies, and having legislation challenged in the High Court and struck down, because what Sir Robert Menzies found out was that this parliament cannot legislate willy-nilly. It draws its powers from the constitution. Where is the constitutional head of power for this piece of legislation, either amended or unamended? It is not the Racial Discrimination Act. This cannot be said to be a special measure under the Racial Discrimination Act for the advantage or protection of Aboriginal heritage, which would make it a head of power under the external affairs power. That argument will be tested and if that argument succeeds then it will not be the external affairs head of power under which this parliament passes this sleazy, grubby bill. Will it be under the race power, under that piece of the constitution that was amended some 30 years ago, where the Prime Minister tells us he had pleasure in recommending a 'Yes' vote, where over 90 per cent of the Australian population voted to give the national parliament responsibility under the constitution to protect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from the ravages of state and territory governments? The race power reads, in section 51(xxvi): . . . the people of any race . . . for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. There is a live argument that this piece of legislation doesn't fall under the race power, because the race power can only be used if it is necessary for the race, if it is to advance the race, not if it is to the detriment of the race. I just put this government on notice that, amended or unamended in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act, this piece of legislation will be challenged. What a waste. It is not necessary for the building of the bridge on even the government's own advice. But I think it is going to be very important in the current climate because this Prime Minister, who parades as the great defender of the flag and the constitution, who has allowed an undermining of the High Court, is having a piece of legislation taken up to the High Court that says this parliament cannot be a town planning parliament when it comes to Aboriginal heritage protection. I just leave it at that. It is a live issue. No-one knows which way the court will decide. Again, it reinforces the views that I took to the shadow cabinet a long time ago. It is unnecessary legislation. It is only here to play politics with Aboriginal people, to divide South Australia, to get those votes in South Australia by playing the race card. (Time expired)",229
308,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"I wanted to stay out of this and I spoke very briefly. I will just put some things on the record and honourable members might accept that I have some right to speak on Aboriginal matters with some credibility too. This is done for one very simple reason. I will make predictions as to what will happen now. Because this debate has not gone back to the Senate, there will be a legal challenge. We will be forced to appoint another inquiry. That will come out of ATSIC' s funds and we will waste, yet again, more resources on this before it comes back to be considered a final time by the Senate. That will be a tragedy. It is not totally unnecessary and it is too late now because, as the honourable member says, the Senate is on adjournment. Further, as to the issue about the race power, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has given us advice that it falls within the race power and we have to operate on that advice, as honourable members would know, having been in government themselves. In the end, I make a prediction and the shadow minister makes a prediction. The wonderful thing about the historical record in this place is that one of us will be proven right and one of us will be proven wrong. I am happy to have history make that judgment.",230
309,Mr LEE,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"The simple point I make to the minister is that the government can accept the amendments that have been successfully moved in the Senate. It does not have to go back to the Senate. If you accept the amendment that has been moved in the Senate, the legislation as amended is carried. The only amendment is that your legislation is subject to the Racial Discrimination Act. What is so bad about that? Question resolved in the affirmative.

311,Mr CHARLES,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997. This is a historical bill for this parliament. It is indeed a worthy measure and one that is supported in essence by almost all in the Australian community. For a very long time-far too long-we have had a problem with unemployment in Australia. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997 acts on only one small measure to address one of the consequences of that unemployment. At the beginning of my remarks, I want to comment that I am advised that in the major developed world Australia is relatively alone amongst major trading nations in having an unemployment benefits scheme which applies to those who have never been employed. Think about that again-an unemployment benefits scheme which applies to those who have never been employed. The consequences of that philosophy-that practice which puts into place the philosophy-is that on one side we encourage those people who have not been entrants in the labour market to not become entrants. As long as the safety net, the support system, is great enough, then the normal incentives that drive people into the labour market-to learn to do and care for themselves, to develop those work attitudes, that ethic, that understanding of the need to be self-sufficient which helps to drive most of us-are lacking. Without that ethic being applied, we deny some people an opportunity to truly participate in society and to live satisfactory, fulfilling lives for themselves. I am advised that there are young people who are third generation members of families where they, the third generation, match their parents and their grandparents in that none have ever worked. That is, indeed, a sad reflection on Australian society. We have failed those people. We have failed them desperately because we have denied them the opportunity to take full advantage of their citizenship of this indeed great country. The work for the dole scheme is not an employment panacea. It is not really about employment. What it is about is giving young people particularly, and others who have been unemployed for a very long time and perhaps lack the work ethic which most of us have, the opportunity to participate in useful work-work which is useful for the country, for society, for their communities, which is valued, which they themselves can value, and which helps give them a start to develop the work ethic which they need if they are going to truly participate. Many employers that I have talked to around the nation tell me that in interviewing young people for jobs, for entry into the work force, they find some percentage of young people today who they say, in their words, have a poor attitude problem. They have a problem with their attitude towards work and towards what it means. That problem, I contend, is twofold. Number one is their lack of understanding of what the real world of work is all about, those simple things like getting up in the morning on time to get to work on time, the fact that having a job means a commitment to the employer, to the company, to the operation, to the goods or services which that company produces. That part of the problem with defining for young people what the world of work is all about will be addressed, in essence, by this bill. There is a second part to that equation. That is, that we find today-employers tell us and young people from all over the country tell me frequently-they really are unsure about what jobs and what careers might be available for them today. This bill will not address the second half of that equation, but it will help young people in the pilot programs on the work for the dole scheme to have a better understanding of what real work is all about. For sure, not only has industry changed over the last decade or two but society has changed. At the same time that we have built into our education structure the incentive for young people to stay on in school, we have found that the numbers of entry level jobs in business, industry and commerce have been falling. This creates a great dichotomy for us. It creates great problems and we really need solutions to look at how we address finding employment for young people and how we help make them more employable. I have a view that this bill is about the latter. For those young people who have lost hope, who have lost touch or never had the touch, it is about giving them a bit of a chance to get some work experience so that they see what work is all about, develop a bit of enthusiasm, a bit of a desire to continue and go on and find a real and meaningful job where then they may need to build on their lack of skills to make them more employable or to give them a satisfactory career path. I noted the remarks of the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). The member for Curtin decried the fact that over the last couple of decades we seemed to have ceased the practice of giving young people the opportunity to learn how to work at work. So on-the-job training, which used to be commonplace in Australia, has been replaced to a large extent with off-the-job training. Much of that offthe-job training has been through formal education institutes, either through secondary school, staying until the end of year 12, or staying in secondary school until year 11 and finding an apprenticeship or a traineeship or, indeed, leaving school but still managing, through some transition program or other, being able to access TAFE or some private sector training institute in order to get qualified skills which, hopefully, are universally recognised around the country. All the off-the-job training in the world will never totally prepare a person for real work, in real jobs, in real industry or business or commerce if they have never been there. We can do all kinds of preparation programs, prework programs, and try to teach young people how to get up on time, how to brush their teeth, how to use deodorant, how to stay on the job until the day is finished and not knock off for lunch half an hour early and come back an half hour late. It is true that these are important things that lots of young people need to learn because they have not yet had their first jobs. Those people who have not yet had their first jobs are those we are talking about in this bill. Those programs are useful, but nothing, in my view, will ever replace real work as a real incentive and a real driver for young people to encourage them to then go on and to further their education and further their skill acquisition, to look for new opportunities, to try to grow in their employment or, at times, to create employment for themselves by becoming self-employed. This is a good government initiative that deserves support from both side of the House. I noted that the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) spoke, not eloquently but certainly forcefully, about the fact that this was degrading to young people and that somehow it would stigmatise those who were victims. I have heard a lot about victimology in this place over the last few years. I tell you what: the more you tell people that they are victims the more they believe it themselves and the harder it ever is to get them out of a cycle of despair and failure. Once you are a victim, you are a victim. How many victims do we take through our court system today for one reason or another? I note that there was a time when if you walked down the footpath and you fell over a crack you said, 'I made a mistake.' Today you say, 'It must be the council's fault, so I will sue the council.' Mr Deputy Speaker, I understand there is urgent business before the House. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

312,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I move: That the further requested amendments be agreed to. The government accepts these amendments from the Senate. The effect is to increase the levy surcharge threshold by an extra $1,500 for the second and every subsequent child. This makes it a bit more family friendly, although I must concede that I still think $100,000 for the people that you or I, Mr Deputy Speaker, represent is a very large family income. It is important that these amendments are now passed and that we can go ahead with planning and promoting the changes which will come into effect on 1 July.",233
313,Mr LEE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"We will not be dividing on this issue. I am a bit intrigued as to the reasons the government might have agreed to these amendments. I would not be surprised if the numbers in the Senate had something to do with this amendment being accepted by the government. We are children, the family surcharge think it is a bit strange given that the governthreshold under paragraph (b) is: ment, according to a secret document that we have released in this chamber on another occasion, indicated it was considering lowering the thresholds as part of the government's current budget process. But, for whatever reason, if the government wants to accept proposals put to them by certain senators, then that is something the government will have to wear. We will not be forcing the House to a division on this matter. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES) BILL 1996 Consideration of Senate Message Message received from the Senate returning the bill and acquainting the House that the Senate does not insist upon its amendment disagreed to by the House and has made further amendments to the bill and desires the concurrence of the House in the further amendments made by the Senate. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendments(1) Clause 2, page 2 (lines 4 and 5), omit subclause (5). (2) Schedule 3, item 1, page 14 (line 5), omit ""$1,430"", substitute ""$1,250"". (3) Schedule 3, item 2, page 14 (lines 6 and 7), omit the item.

314,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move: That the further amendments made by the Senate be agreed to. The government accepts these amendments. They relate to the level of expenditure above which the rebate for health expenditure cuts in. The government wished that to be $1,430 - ut the Senate has said that it will agree to a fIgure of $1,250, and we accept this.",234
315,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The op-o-ition is on record through previous dIvISIOns as opposing any increase in the threshold. We believe that raising the threshold for the medical expenses taxation rebate - imply hurts those people who are chronically III or those people who choose to self-insure. Gi-en the massive tax subsidies that are being paid to people who take out private health Insurance we do not think we should be reducing the benefits that flow to people who might choose to be self-insured. Because we have made our position on this very clear in previous divisions, we will not be forcing the House to another division tonight. I just make that point that the opposition remains firmly opposed to the government's decision to raise the threshold. Perhaps the minister might take on notice a request to drop me a note through the mail to let me know what the cost to revenue might be for these two amendments, rather than force the House to wait by my asking questions here at the dispatch box. It would be .interesting to know what the original savIngs were and what the savings will now be as a result of the changes that are being made. I am happy to accept the minister's assurance that he will drop me a note through the mail. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Motion (by Dr Wooldridge) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Work for the Dole",234
316,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to address some remarks on this work for the dole scheme because it is quite clear I am not going to get a chance to talk on it otherwise. This scheme was based very loosely on the CDEP scheme that works in Aboriginal communities, where some Aboriginal communities do work for the dole. The government has extolled the virtues of the scheme. I know this scheme very well and the truth is that where it is administered well it is a brilliant scheme-that is probably in something less than 10 per cent of all cases. Where it is not administered well it is horrendous demoralising and leads to the aggrandisement of a few people and the masses getting even less than they would normally get. I suspect that the problem with the government's work for the dole scheme will lie in that area of administration. It is quite clear to me that the best people to handle this administration is local government. I believe the government would have done well to consider empowering local government to be the authority through which work for the dole schemes operated. I personally support work for the dole, not that it has anything to do with employment. I was rather interested to hear the member for - a Trobe (Mr Charles) lamenting the passIng of those school leaving entry level Jobs. The member for La Trobe is one of the great advocates of that false theory of rational economics. I think he actually believes that rational economics is some form of neoclassical economic-, when in fact it is nothing of the sort. RatIOnal economics is a scheme thought up by multinational businessprincipally American-to dominate world trade, and it will see a continual reduction in wages. In the United States they have allowed themselves to develop a 20 per cent underclass. In the case of the United States that undercl-ss is principally black, and they are addreSSIng that problem by building bigger and bigger gaols. It is certainly not the scenario I want for Australia. Unless you are prepared to seriously look - t the esta-lishment of manufacturing industry In AustralIa we are going to go down the same road. It is people like the member for La Trobe who are the great supporters of this rational economics that will destroy manufacdate, turing. The government will say, as did Keating government say, both quite dishonestwhy ly, that things are okay: elaborately transwhat formed manufactures are increasing. It is that they have increased the percentage foreign earnings. It was off a small figure is now presentable. What they do not say is that the entry into Australia of similar products-elaborately transformed manufactured goods-has grown at the same rate off a bigger base. So the gap is actually getting bigger not smaller. We are still seeing our industries eroded. It is not a matter massive protection. I do not believe in sive protection. But I do believe in sensible protection. It is quite clear that there is no way, no matter how efficient you are in your industry, that you can protect it from countment. ries that have minuscule levels of wages. The only future I want for my children is a high wage, high skill, high productivity country. We are going the wrong way in all of those categories. I want to say in the 60 or 70 seconds left to me that I think there is an element of fraudulence in this whole debate. I know the government has rejected a scheme which would have actually created real jobs. It would have been much cheaper than the government's proposal. It simply sought to match school leavers-kids not going to universities-in vocational classes and posflight sessing computer skills with small business. The cost per electorate worked out at $100,000. It would have only required the employment of 20 people to have made it cost neutral to the government. This scheme :-vas sabotaged principally by Brendan Smyth III Senator Vanstone's office and by the Deputy Secretary Tony Greer, the man who also sabotaged it when it was put up to Labor Party. I believe that the senior manageintegrity, ment of DEET actually know, or feel, that their ongoing job security relies on high levels of unemployment. They have no real concern for the unemployed and it is an patterns indictment of both political parties that they have allowed themselves to be manipulated by these fraudulent bureaucrats. Proposed Second Sydney Airport",234
317,Mrs VALE,ADJOURNMENT,"To no-one has been able to provide a the convincing, reasoned and logical argument our government is so actively pursuing many industry sources consider to be an true incorrect approach and decision to build of another airport within close proximity to base. The Kingsford Smith Airport. Originally, the main arguments against the development of a new integrated international freight and passenger airport complex outside of the Sydney basin region were based upon the operational capabilities concerning weathof er and distance from major cities. Most of masthese arguments now have been addressed, which gives rise to the question why requests for initial preliminary studies into alternative sites are so strongly rejected by the governThere are a number of reasons which help substantiate arguments supporting development away from the Sydney basin. Northern and southern options for Holsworthy both provide conflict with noise and urban population area development. Reduction in social and living standards resulting from a high density airport are well recognised and are in fact one of the reasons why another airport must be built to support Kingsford Smith, which has a movements cap and curfew limitation on it. High density traffic and converging inbound paths coupled with departures from two closely located airports catering to high performance passenger aircraft provide a complex matrix of flight paths and holding patterns capable of encroaching upon operational safety in terms of vertical and horizontal separation. Reduced separation minimums, whilst generally within the navigational capability of modem airlines and which will the become the norm with greater instrument still impact on safety standards and increased workloads during highly critical periods of flight and precision approaches. This is further complicated with growth indicating a larger number of flights operating over built-up areas. The crash of a major airline into a residential area is too horrendous to consider. The chance of casualties increases with this scenario. Compare this to an accident over non-improved clear land. The probability of increased accidents is accentuated when aircraft are either in a landing configuration or just after take-off when they are in a transitional phase. The development of a further airport also unable to operate on a 24-hour basis defies logic and provides an uneven playing field to Australian business trying to be competitive in Asia. Almost all reports indicate that airport and operators' efficiency must increase to a degree which makes them competitive with Asia and other world markets. The remoteness of Australia, even considering time zones et cetera, makes marketing and competition at the best of times difficult. Traffic management both in the air and on the ground is a critical art of airport planning. Air traffic management is a well developed area, but only in recent years have many airports had to deal with traffic congestion on the ground as well. Asian airports such as Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul and others have experienced dramatic increases in aircraft movements as well as passenger throughputs and have therefore had to improve systems capable of coping as well as look towards relocation of airports away from urban and residential sprawl. Many airports have required the interfacing of airport terminals to high speed train systems demanded by the distance that these airports are located from city and regional centres. Simply replicating former standards cannot help an airport compete in the modem en vironmen t. Whilst it is acknowledged that some sites worthy of consideration are further away from the larger residential area of Sydney than would otherwise be considered practical, it is very much in keeping with regional development. This coupled with the availability of improved rail transport and less congested road transport is not as impractical as originally thought. Importantly, many cargo items currently on arrival in Sydney require further trans-shipment to other centres within Australia. If Australia wants to be a part of Asia's phenomenal growth and prosperity anticipated to be the largest within the next decade, it appears particularly short-sighted to build an airport which is immediately going to experience operational limitations on start up. Is the government prepared to allow operations on a 24-hour basis at either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy? And if so, what is the impact going to be on Sydney's pollution and noise levels as well as the social impact? If not allowing 24-hour operations, where is the logic in the argument for such a large investment only being allowed to operate at 50 per cent capacity when most Asian airports are looking to operate on a 24-hour basis? Department of Defence",235
318,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Brisbane) (12.42 a.m.)Yesterday during question time we witnessed a most extraordinary event when the Minister For Defence (Mr MCLachlan) came in here and, in answer to a dorothy dixer, decided to payout on his own department. I cannot recall an occasion when any minister in any portfolio has taken the opportunity to attack officials in his own department in the way in which the Minister for Defence did yesterday. But it flowed quite properly in his mind from a Channel 9 Sunday program which was designed to attack those people within his department who had responsibility for a range of projects. The sad thing about it was that in the making of that program it was widely reported around the traps that the minister had afforded the team from Channel 9 access to documents and people designed to make certain projects and departmental officials appear bad. That is an extraordinary position for any minister of the crown to adopt. For the Minister for Defence to adopt that position is astounding. The people in the defence department, both those in uniform and the civilian staff in the department, do not deserve that sort of treatment from anyone, much less the minister who has a responsibility to ensure they are not just properly administered but properly represented. Let me tum to some of the comments he made during the course of that answer, because he quite simply presented information incorrectly and, in the process, also managed to forget some of the things he himself has said on other occasions. The projects that were involved that he referred to were the Collins class submarines, the landing craft heavy, Jindalee over-thehorizon, and the minehunters. In the three minutes left let me make a quite comment about a couple of those. In relation to the Collins class submarines, there is no doubt that Australia has acquired a leading edge capability which has been recognised around the world, including by senior American naval officials who were here recently with Tandem Thrust. But I think the comment that best illustrates the point comes from the minister himself. On 16 May last year, the minister said this about the Collins submarines: This is a high quality submarine from a high quality Australian project. The enthusiasm, sionalism and sheer technological expertise of all involved, both in the ASC, its subcontractors and RAN is remarkable. And it is. It is a pity that the minister decided to play some petty politics in the lead-up to the Sunday program and compound that by his comments here in the House earlier this week. I should say that was part of the grand plan. It was intended to release yesterday the MCIntosh review of Defence efficiency. It was all part of the grand plan. Let Channel 9 come in and do a bucket job on the defence department, have that shown on TV and broadcast last Sunday and then come out this week with a public report saying, 'Shock, horror, terrible waste! We have to make these cuts.' The plan fell apart when the cabinet committee decided they wanted to have a closer look at the proposal. It was a bit like Army 21, a bit like Army Restructure. This report has now been put off-although I do not think it will have to wait around for the three or four months Army Restructure did. I think we will probably see the fruits or otherwise of the efficiency review within the month. In terms of the landing craft heavy, I just make this observation. There was an interesting comment in the respected magazine Asia Pacific Defence Reporter in July-August of last year about that subject when the controversy arose. The article concluded: The purchase cost of Kanimbla and Manoora,they are the two shipswith refit and conversion costs (all spent in Australia), is reportedly expected to be about $A170 million-some $A80 million less than the cost of one larger new ship. The simple fact of life is that we will have a very good capability at a very good price. But this was not without its humour. The minister has to learn to stick to the script his office gives him. The question did not actually refer to the minehunters but, in his enthusiasm, the minister got carried away and did refer to them. It is a sad story in relation to the minehunters. They were a shambles. They sit in Sydney unable to go out and do not do much profesat all. Do you know who signed up to them? The one person who actually knew and got embarrassed about the question-the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who was the then Minister for Defence. The person who signed to put them on the public list was the right honourable Ian Sinclair. The simple fact is that, of all the cases mentioned by the Minister for Defence yesterday, the only one which was an absolute shambles was the one signed up to by the previous Liberal government, although it was signed up to in good faith. Nonetheless, if we want to talk about where there has been waste, of all the issues that Channel 9 broadcast and of all the issues the minister raised, that was the one that was the doozey. (Time expired) Work for the Dole",236
319,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"Earlier this evening, news came from the Senate that Labor has blocked this government's work for the dole scheme. I cannot believe that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) says one thing yet his colleagues in the Senate do another. Just how out of touch are they? Don't they realise that most Australians want to participate in the work for the dole scheme? Don't they realise that young Australians feel that they have a right to contribute to the future of their area and this country of theirs, Australia? To prolong the passing of this bill is to demonstrate how little the opposition cares about allowing those who do want to participate to do so. It would become a way of uniting the community. This government's initiative of the work the dole is something the people of Australia have been asking for for a long time. To both employed and unemployed, it presents a of participating in the future of the country. We are all aware that the balance of scale is no longer equal when we have fit and healthy persons, many of whom are unemployed through no fault of their own, not contributing towards today's society and relying on those who are paying taxes. The attitude of some of our unemployed relation to work and their lack of work ethic is causing some animosity within the comfor munity-nowhere more than in my own this electorate where we have 53 per cent of all and ongoing. residents on some form of benefit. Let me illustrate that in figures we can all understand and which are quite frightening. For example, manufacturing and industry injects $65 million per year into the economy of Gilmore; tourism and hospitality injects $45 million; and social security and welfare benefits, million. That is $55 million per year of taxpayers' funds for social services into the economy of Gilmore. I bring to the attention of the House both pride and enthusiasm a project that was initiated by the community for the community to be operated by the community, known as Shoalhaven Earning a Living-or, as we put would know it, working for the dole. This project of work for the dole, or Shoalhaven Earning a Living, in my electorate ed before this government's announcement of the work for the dole scheme. In the Gilmore electorate, we had only three options. The first was to do nothing, the second was to act responsibly and take charge by the communiof ty for the community, and the third was to work in with the government's proposal and to continue to explain our proposal as a medium through which to work by. Our aims are now to expand and modify our proposal to fall into the government's pilot scheme, as all our projects are ready to go. The government's proposal is for participants to work on community assistance and development projects sponsored by community organisations, local or state governments and firms. Projects would typically include for maintenance and improvement of community facilities and infrastructure and the development of new facilities and programs of comway munity care and assistance-for example, home maintenance and care of the elderly. The number of hours the person would be required to work has been standardised on the basis of the age of the person and having regard to the national training wage. This would amount to two days per week for 18 to 20 year oIds, based upon a six-hour day, or in 2Y2 days per week for persons aged 21 years or over. They would be required to participate a maximum of six months each and I hope will be increased to become indefinite This initiative would be primarily, but not exclusively, targeted at young unemployed people aged between 18 and 24 who have been receiving unemployment allowances for longer than six months. There will be scope for participation of older job seekers in some $55 circumstances and some locations. I could go on about the project, but in the interests of time in the House could I just say that I appreciate the interest shown by with Minister Kemp and Minister Newman, who gave their time to attend a presentation of the project by members of the Shoalhaven Area Consultative Committee. It also needs to be on the public record that those associated with the compilation of the project did so on a voluntary basis, an act that until now has was initiatnot been acknowledged. It is also an unknown fact that some hundreds of unemployed, retired and semi-retired men and women with qualifications and skills have come forward to offer their services free charge to assist with the work for the dole scheme. Already over 1,000 places have been offered by sponsors for community projects that will be developed as the program progresses. It should be noted that a 10 per cent reduction in the unemployed in the Shoalhaven would render a saving to the government of $5 million, not to mention of course the lessening of the ill-feeling that currently exists between the employed and the unemployed. To date, we have over 60 community groups in the Shoal haven who have given written endorsement of the project, including the local council. We have six projects ready to start today. It is now our main objective, having gone this far, to be chosen as a pilot scheme. Having been chosen, we will be able to provide the government with qualitative and quantitative information on our progress. Our project is aimed at all unemployed, regardless of age, with a focus on youth and the long term unemployed. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Regrettably, in our area, a lot of men on quite high incomes-but and to the isolation-have found that it is not who have children by three different fathers and receiving, naturally, a third of the parents that they have spent very little little opportunity to form a bond with their payments.

A recent criticism of the report-I want inadequately with repartnered couples. I can say to that issue. What I have to say is that this who was a member of the committee ever suggested set in concrete. What we did say is that these a scheme like the Child Support Agency I know that the government, following a the cost of children. Can I say that one of the the formula is derived, the historical development different models trying to determine the cost expecting that this New South Wales study is changing the formula or changing the percentages, I have always said that we need to put a reality. The only way we can do that is by to do that about a different set of circumstances be understood how well, how fairly and how study is being undertaken. There is no such study regret that. We did make recommendations to change going to cost? One of the things I always try some sense of what the cost to the government marvellous recommendations that will never going to cost the government $13 million to on both sides. Non-custodial parents say to far enough, that it will not do enough, and probably expressed some concern. But this I have to say that Senator the Hon.

Custodial parents have also was the basis for making a change. Short, when he was Assistant Treasurer, starting which I took some offence. He used to write to backbenchers passed it on-that the percentages in the formula. Absolutely true, to the formula and he never conceded in this committee report and I feel that I need on my part. Firstly, Senator Neal says that she the scheme. Can I say that this was extensively of opinion was that arrangements had been the conditions because of the new scheme would 1 custodial parents poorly and I really think that, identify these people and ensure that, if there for the amount, we write to them and make sure and fund those cases. That would be far fairer than NA Wednesday, 26 March 1997 bringing them into stage 2, but I have to say there are fewer of them. I have some sympathy with the recommendation next two recommendations. Firstly, it was incomes-that is, the amount at which the reasons why it was set at 2.5 per cent. originated there was no ability for custodial Family Court. No matter how imperfect the child support recognise that it is imperfect-there is now an it at 2.5 instead of two of average weekly earnings, is that the consultative committee believed spending on children plateaus and then falls away. Let me take a ridiculous example. Are we million, then the custodial parent should be so. We are not talking about an income of $1 is contested, let there be research. But that by Senator Neal in her comments. The other recommendation relates to dropping talking about here is that, if you drop the disregarded the pension cut-off point, 91 per cent of custodial is no change to their child support. So we custodial parents. What is the effect of it? that the withdrawal rate should only be 50c-in custodial parent over and above that figure, parent. So you are talking about a withdrawal best-off custodial parents. How ridiculous to that it is a disincentive to work and that it is plainly ridiculous. One of the approaches that I really appreciate is that he said he is not going to tackle these he is going to tackle them on an equity and fairness When people like me and other members of this which concerns a difficult area, I guess I get trying to label us as being pro-this or anti-that. I am in favour of families: intact families, families; I think they are all made up of humans. a primacy of women in a first relationship relationship. I believe that they are women. I gender because they are actually marrying someone minority report here. I always thought people Committee said about those recommendations. I am highlighting it now. The other thing I wanted to say to the Main frustration, I think, by all who have served MAIN COMMITTEE 3309 that the children are growing up and each year but I do not have any sympathy for the to resist reducing the cap on non-custodial formula no longer applies. Now there are two The first reason was that when the scheme was parents to get a departure other than going to the review officer scheme is-and we certainly ability to get a departure that way. So by setting the first reason is out, by fact. The second that you reach a point in income where the arguing that, if a non-custodial parent earns $1 receiving $180,000 in child support? I do not think million here but I am making the point. If this is what is stated. Those issues are not addressed the disregarded income level. What we are income level of the custodial parent to parents are completely unaffected-there are talking about approximately nine per cent of I give you again the one-child case. We have said other words, if $1 of income is earned by a 50c is taken off the income of the non-custodial rate of 9c in the dollar. This is for the so-called suggest, as is suggested in the minority report, is going to seriously affect custodial parents-it about the honourable member for Werriwa issues of child support on a gender equity basis, basis. I think that that is long overdue. parliament serve on a committee such as this, a bit uptight when other people cannot resist separated families, single-parent families, serial I do not believe, for example, that there is over and above women in a second and subsequent do not believe that they lose 10 per cent of their for the second time.

I of fathers and mothers in my electorate, make of the highest priority, a full and exhaustive Main Committee adjourned at 1.25 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Family Law Act (Question No. 1256) Mr Mossfield asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 5 February 1997. Are there proposals to (a) amend legislation to ensure that court orders setting in place parental access to children can be enforced, (b) enable the enforcement of access orders when one of the estranged parents moves children within a State or interstate and (c) provide penalties when one of the estranged parents continues to breach access orders. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Since June 1996 the Family Law Act 1975 no longer provides for access by parents to their children. Rather, the Family Law Reform Act 1995 amended the Act in recognition that it is the right of children to have contact with their parents, provided that contact is in the children's best interests. Instead of custody, guardianship and access orders, the Family Court now makes parenting orders, including residence, contact and specific issues orders. Transitional provisions ensure that access orders in effect at the commencement of the Reform Act continue to have effect, and are treated as if they were contact orders made under the new legislation. In considering issues such as enforcement of Family Court orders, it is important to recognise the fundamental change of approach that the amendments embody, and the new emphasis on reaching flexible and tailored arrangements under which both parents can continue to share their parental responsibilities after separation, unless this is not in the children's best interests. The issues relating to enforcement of contact orders were considered by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its 1995 report ""For the Sake of the Kids"". That report recognised that lack of compliance is not a simple or isolated issue, and that a non-punitive approach may better serve the aim of facilitating contact in many cases. The Commission also recommended that the best interests of the children should be the paramount consideration in any approach to enforcement of orders. NA The report made a number of recommendations in relation to complex contact cases in the Family Court, including some relating to the legislative regime for dealing with breaches of contact orders. The report is currently under consideration. (b) A contact order made by the Family Court remains enforceable unless and until it is varied, suspended, discharged or set aside. Action may be taken against a person who moves children within a State or interstate without agreement from the other parent or the Court, and thereby prevents compliance with a contact order. The question of enforcement of contact orders where a parent moved children within a State or interstate was not considered separately by the Law Reform Commission. There are no proposals under consideration to treat enforcement of contact orders where the parents live a significant distance apart differently from other contact orders. (c) The Family Law Act 1975 provides a range of orders that may be made by the Court when it is satisfied that a person has, without reasonable excuse, contravened an order, including a contact order. The orders that may be made by the court include: a sentence of imprisonment for a period of 12 months or less, a fine, requiring the person to enter into a recognizance, a contact order, having regard to the deprivation of contact resulting from the contravention. Pursuant to arrangements with all States and Territories except New South Wales, the Court can also make a community service order. The Australian Law Refom Commission recommended that the Court's discretion as to the appropriate penalty should be maintained, but that the Court should give greater consideration to the circumstances where community service orders and periodic detention may be appropriate. The Commission further recommended that imprisonment should continue to be a sanction of last resort only. The Family Law Council is currently collecting data on penalties imposed by the Family Court. Once sufficient data has been collected and analysed, the Council will report to me on the issues arising from the Council's analysis of the data. Australia Post: Letter Boxes (Question No. 1272) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 10 February 1997: (1) How many Australia Post letter boxes have been removed or relocated from the post code areas of (a) 3044, (b) 3046, (c) 3056, (d) 3058, (e) 3040, (f) 3041, (g) 3060, (h) 3055 and (i) 3057. (2) Does Australia Post have further plans to relocate letter boxes in the post code areas referred to in part (1). Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The following Australia Post letter boxes have been removed or relocated since 1 July 1993: (a) 3. (b) 6. (c) o. (d) O. (e) 2. (f) 2. (g) O. (h) O. (i) O. (2) Australia Post is continually reviewing the extent of its services and methods of operation to ensure that the facilities provided are adequate to meet the reasonable needs of the community and that the resources available are used to the best advantage. At this stage, Australia Post has no plans to withdraw or relocate any post boxes within the above postcode areas. However, any decision in this regard would be considered in the light of any circumstantial changes such as changed road/traffic conditions and/or the level of customer patronage. Legal Fees: Member for Fremantle (Question No. 1288)  Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 11 February 1997: Did the previous Government commit the Commonwealth to paying the legal fees of the firm of solicitors, Dunhill Madden and Butler, on behalf of the member for Fremantle in her action to contest the appointment of the Marks Royal Commission; if so, when. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As Dunhill Madden Butler have made a claim for legal costs against the Commonwealth which is currently before the Federal Court of Australia, it would be inappropriate for me to offer any comment at this stage. Department of Primary Industries and Energy: Consultants (Question No. 1317) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 13 February 1997 : (I) How many consultancies valued at $5000 or more have been commissioned by the Minister's Department since 1 April 1996. (2) Which firms were awarded individual consultancies. (3) What Western Australias the (a) value and (b) broad nature of each consultancy. (4) What was the duration of each consultancy which has been completed. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourqble member's question is as follows : (1) The Primary Industries and Energy Portfolio has commissioned 172 consultancies valued at $5000 or more since 1 April 1996. (2)-(4) Details of all consultancies with expenditure greater than $2000 are published annually in the Supplementary Information to the Annual Report of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Airport Leases: Tenders (Question No. 1360) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 26 February 1997: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a report in the Melbourne Age of 17 February 1997 concerning statements attributed to a Senator MCGauran in relation to the tendering for airport leases. (2) Has the Minister provided (a) Senator MCGauran or (b) Coalition Members of Parliament with details of the airport lease bidding. (3) Has Senator MCGauran or any other Coalition Member of Parliament made representations to the Minister (a) on behalf of any bidder or (b) concerning aspects of the tendering process for Melbourne Airport. (4) What safeguards have been put in place by the Minister's Department to guarantee the probity of the airport leasing process. Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of the article to which Mr Thomson refers. (2) I have not provided (a) Senator MCGauran or (b) Coalition Members of Parliament with details Germany. of the airport lease bidding. (3) Neither Senator MCGauran or any other Hanover. Coalition Member of Parliament has made representations to me (a) on behalf of any bidder or (b) concerning aspects of the tendering process for Melbourne airport. (4) Both the Government and the Office of Asset Sales (OAS) are very concerned to ensure the probity and integrity of the airport leasing process. Measures put in place by OAS to ensure that probity of the process is maintained, include: all bidders being made aware of the Government's procedures to protect the probity of process at the commencement of tendering for the airports both in bid documentation and discussions with bidders; a requirement that all bidders and consultants the process, including the Government's tants, sign strict confidentiality agreements; all confidentiality agreements were checked before bidders and consultants were given access to confidential information; as part of their bid, bidders were make statutory declarations that they had not engaged in collusive or anti-competitive iour, had not taken steps to obtain or use confidential Commonwealth or FAC information other than that which had been provided tendering process, and had not placed themselves in a position which may have or did a conflict of interest during the Phase 1 airports tender process; and all bids and related documentation have been made available to key members ment Sales Team on a need-to-know basis only. World Exposition: Hamburg, Germany (Question No. 1366) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: (1) Is a world exposition to be held at Hamburg, Germany, in the year 2000. (2) Will Australia be represented at that exposition: if so, what form will the representation take. (3) What sum will Australia be spending on its presence at the Hamburg Expo and how many Australians will be employed. (4) What plans have been developed for Australia's representation at Hamburg. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Expo 2000 will be held in Hanover, (2) Australia will not participate in Expo 2000 in (3) Not applicable. (4) Not applicable. World Exposition: Lisbon, Portugal (Question No. 1367) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for the Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: (I) Further to his answer to question No.618 the (Hansard, 18 November 1996, page 7037) is he able to say how many countries will be represented in at the world exposition in Portugal in 1998. (2) On how many occasions has Australia not to been represented at world expositions and when consuland where was the last instance. (3) Will Australia have a presence at the Lisbon carefully expo in 1998; if not, why not. (4) Is he able to say whether countries in Australia's region will have a presence at Lisbon: required to if so, which countries. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable behavmember's question is as follows: (I) I understand that in the order of 100 countries as part of the have agreed to participate. (2) On five occasions since 1967; the last give rise to instance was Genoa in 1992. (3) As advised in my response to question No. 618 Australia will not participate in Expo 98. This decision was taken on economic grounds, in the of the Governlight of fiscal targets. (4) I have no knowledge of which countries may have agreed to participate. Year 2000 Olympic Games: Tourism (Question No. 1368) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism upon notice, on 27 February 1997: Further to his answer to question No. 574 (Hansard, 16 September 1996, page 4394), what is the forecast for inbound tourists in (a) 1998, (b) 1999, (c) 2000, (d) 2001 and (e) 2002. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) 1998-5.011m. (b) 1999-5.458m. (c) 2000-6.013m. (d) 2001-6.563m. (e) 2002-7.118m. Griffin Venture: Declarations (Question No. 1439) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, upon notice, on 4 March 1997: (1) Is the Minister able to say whether statutory declaration, made by members of the crew of the Griffin Venture state that purge pipes were not properly earthed. (2) Would it have been impossible to drill near Ningaloo Reef for many years if the Griffin Venture had exploded. (3 Is the Minister able to say whether (a) a similar breach of safety standards on the Griffin Venture occurred 19 months earlier (b) BHP at that time reported that measures had been taken to ensure safety breaches would not re-occur and (c) a dangerous freeing incident occurred on the labiru Venture on 23 March 1996; if so, (d) does the Minister have confidence in BHP's attitude to safety matters. (4) Is the Minister able to say whether the report on the Griffin Venture by Dr Barrell acknowledges that pipes were not earthed properly and therefore there was potential for ignition. (5) Is the Minister able to say how Dr Barrell concluded that the Griffin Venture was never in jeopardy. (6) Did Mr T Visscher request on 19 April 1996 a list of documents supplied to Dr Barrell by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE); if so was the list provided on 21 May 1996; if so, why. (7) Was the transcript of the master's evidence made available to Dr Barrell but not that of Mr Visscher; if so, why. (8) Is the Minister able to say whether the master of the labiru Venture cleaned the tanks by purging them with sea water en route to Singapore. (9) Had Dr Barrell concluded his report before DPIE had provided its list of questions. (10) Was additional evidence from Mr Visscher considered. (11) What documents were provided (a) to Dr Barrell and (b) by Mr Visscher. (12) (a) Was Mr Visscher's submission provided to Dr Barrell; if not, why not. (13) Did Mr Visscher fax DPIE on 25 May 1996 a list with 339 potentially relevant documents. (14) Was Mr Visscher advised on 30 May 1996 that the (a) DPIE Safety Officer was unaware of the existence of the majority of the documents on Mr Visscher's list and (b) report had been finalised and Dr Barrell had returned to England. (15) Did Dr Barrell not consider all relevant documents; if not, is his report satisfactory. (16) Is the Minister able to say where the master of the Griffin Venture on 29 May 1994 is now employed. (17) Will the Minister initiate a parliamentary inquiry into either the safety culture of BHP or the incidents referred to in this question. Mr Anderson-The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. The statutory declarations state that purge pipes were not properly earthed. (2) No. In the completely hypothetical instance that the Griffin Venture had exploded on 29 May 1994, it is highly improbable that there would have been any impact on the Ningaloo Reef whatsoever Ningaloo Reef is 68 km to the south west of . the Griffin Venture's location; the prevailing trade winds are from the south east, blowing therefore towards the north west away from the coast, at 15-20 knots; the current is basically parallel to the coast at the Griffin Venture site; oil spill response computer modelling of a worse case scenario of the 29 May 1994 incident, with all the oil on board the facility entering the sea, indicated that the oil would have been carried in a westerly direction, away from the coast; Griffin crude oil is a very light, highly volatile oil with a high dispersion rate-upwards of 70% would evaporate and disperse within nine hours of being spilt in the 25° C water of the area. Wave action would also act to break up the remaining heavy ends. the Ningaloo Reef would therefore not have been at risk. (3) (a) The chronology of the BHPP safety related incidents is 29 May 1994-Griffin Venture gas-freeing incident 3 January 1996 Griffin Venture valve explosion and gas release 23 March labiru Venture gas freeing incident (3) (b) Yes (3) (c) There was a breakdown in safety procedures on the BHPP facility labiru Venture on 23 March 1996 which involved gas freeing. (3) (d) Yes. The Government now does have confidence in BHPP's attitude to safety matters because of Dr Barrell's recognition of the program to upgrade BHPP's safety arrangements that the company had already commenced at the time of his review; the organisation's very positive response to the recommendations of Dr Barrell's report; the company's subsequent very positive commitment to upgrading its offshore safety managment arrangements, improving the safety culture of its employees and the quality and extent of communication between management and the offshore employees; and its demonstration to the Government through a program of regular formal assessments its continued commitment to progress to a standard of world's best safety practice. However, the Government realises that changing the safety culture of the staff of an organisation cannot be done overnight the Government intends to continue with its safety assessments in the immediate future; additionally, the Government has arranged for Dr Barrell to further review the safety arrangements of the company in ApriVMay/June of this year. These actions are intended as positive measures to reinforce the awareness of the BHPP workforce of the need for strict compliance with the safety standards of the organisation. (4) (a) Dr Barrell concluded that "" Mr Visscher's allegations that the purge pipes were not adequately earthed is also subject to conflicting evidence. In my opinion, however, on the balance of probabilities, the pipes were probably not earthed properly"". (4) (b) However, Dr Barrell did not accept that this automatically meant that a source of ignition would have resulted had the cargo tanks been purged through the pipes as they were set up on the day. Dr Barrell's view, conveyed to Departmental officials, was in his expert opinion, there was no guarantee that a source of ignition (hot spots or electrostatic sparks) would have resulted from the gas passing through the purge pipe; he also felt that whether or not an ignition source would have resulted could never be established after the fact-that no laboratory test could duplicate the actual conditions of gas mixture, gas flow rates, temperature, humidity and purge pipe friction sources actually extant on the Griffin Venture on 29 May 1994; in his opinion, then, it was therefore impossible to establish whether in fact a source of ignition would have resulted had the purge pipes been actually used on 29 May 1994, but it certainly was possible that a source of ignition could have been created by improper assembly and earthing. In point of fact, of course, the purge pipes were never actually used during the events of 29 May 1994. (5) Dr Barrell found that ""the Griffin Venture was not placed in jeopardy, in that a flammable concentration of hydrocarbon vapour in air was never present in the cargo tank"". He further stated that ""in terms of preventing a cargo tank explosion, the most important safeguard is to ensure that the atmosphere in the tank never reaches a flammable range. Exclusion of sources of ignition is a second line of defence."" In arriving at his conclusion, Dr Barrell took into consideration the following: that while there is hotly disputed and conflicting evidence as to what the intent of the various parties was in regard to introducing air into the cargo tank whilst it still contained high concentrations of hydrocarbon vapour, the undisputed fact is that air was not introduced into the cargo tank at that time. Therefore, a highly volatile gas mixture-with the specific percentages of hydrocarbon vapour and oxygen required to form an explosive combination-was never actually created in the cargo tank during the operation; similarly, that the unearthed purge pipes, with the possibility of a source of ignition being created if gas was purged through them, were never actually used to purge gas during the operation; therefore, at no time on 29 May 1994 did the elements required to cause an explosion-hydrocarbon vapour and oxygen combined together in proportions which created an explosive mixture and a source of ignition--ever actually exist; therefore, at no time during the events of 29 May 1996, as they actually occurred, was the Griffin Venture ever in danger of exploding, and therefore at no time was the facility actually in jeopardy. (6) (a) Yes. On 19 April 1996, Mr Visscher queried DPIE as to what documents were on file relevant to the 1994 Griffin Venture gas freeing incident. DPIE agreed to supply Mr Visscher with a list of the documents that they had on hand in order that Mr Visscher could then compare that list with his own collection of documents. Mr Visscher offered to make available to DPIE any relevant documents in his own collection that DPIE required. (6) (b) Yes. Dr Barrell considered the 1994 Gr.:Ffin Venture gas freeing incident-including the earthing configuration of the purge pipes and other issues-in the first weeks in his review after examining relevant documents he formed his views after speaking to Mr Visscher and other relevant persons, interviewing BHPP personnel, from his own expert knowledge, his many years of relevant experience, and his consideration of the large amount of written and verbal evidence available to him; his conclusions either already supported Mr Visscher's assertions regarding the earthing of the purge pipes and the improper use of gasfreeing and gas detection procedures, or concerned the state of mind of the Master of the Griffin Venture on 29 May 1996-which Dr Barrel considered could in no way be determined two years later; only in the matter of the Griffin Venture being placed in jeopardy did he disagree with Mr Visscher, and he reached his conclusion on this issue based on his own expert knowledge; he therefore considered that accessing any further documents regarding the 1994 incident would be unnecessary. Dr Barrell felt that his time would be far better spent in complying with the specific Terms of Reference of his review and, in particular, developing a strategy which ensured the future safety of all personnel on BHP Petroleum's facilities; however, DPIE had promised to provide the list to Mr Visscher, and an attempt was made to list the relevant documents on the official files when time allowed. The responsible officers were fully involved in assisting Dr Barrell and on other matters until 21 May 1996. (7) No. Dr Barrell had complete access to all the files of DPIE and the WA and NT regulators, including both Mr Visscher's transcript of evidence as well as that of the Master. (8) It is understood that, during transit to Singapore in 1991, the labiru Venture washed heavy formation sand deposits from some of its tanks prior to the facility's disconnecting from the riser, all traces of hydrocarbons had been thoroughly washed and stripped to an offtake tanker in lieu of a shore sludge storage installation in accordance with the International Safety Guide for Oil Tankers and Terminals recommendations. The standard of tank cleanliness complied with the Marine Pollution Convention (MARPOL) requirements; a final bottom wash was carried out to remove heavy formation sand deposits. These washings were pumped overboard in compliance with MARPOL regulations. The vessel remained over 50 nautical miles south of Lombok Strait approaches until such washing was completed; during these washings, steady stream of dark colored sand mixed with wash water was discharged through the stem manifold. This may have led to a belief that the washings contained oil residues, which they did not. (9) No (10) Yes. Dr Barrell viewed Mr Visscher's video presentation and read the transcript of the video. He also considered Mr Visscher's comments on some of the conclusions and evidence in relation to the various inquiries. He also examined the list of documents supplied by Mr Visscher on 25 May 1996 to see if there was any material contained therein that would affect his views. He concluded that his findings in regard to the 1994 Griffin Venture gas freeing incident would not be changed by consideration of the documents listed by Mr Visscher. II (a) Dr Barrell was provided with access to all relevant material on the DPIE, NT and WA regulator'S files. A list of relevant material contained on the DPIE files, more comprehensive than that provided to Mr Visscher on 25 May 1996, is attached. (b) Additional material supplied by Mr Visscher to DPIE and other sources was provided to Dr Barrell, and forms part of the above list. Mr Visscher's listing of 339 documents was provided to Dr Barrell, though many of the individual documents listed were not. (12) Yes. This material was available to Dr Barrell in the files of the WA regulator, the Designated Authority responsible for the Griffin Venture, when he visited them in May 1996. By this time, he had already spoken to Mr Visscher personally, viewed his video presentation, read the various official reports, interviewed Griffin Venture crew members and spoken to expert AMSA personnel Mr Visscher's submission had already been examined in detail by the joint WNAMSA review in March 1995, and taken into account when formulating that report; there was no additional information in this submission that Dr Barrell had not already considered in other forms; he had already come to conclusions which agreed with Mr Visscher in two out of his four concerns. Consideration of the original submission presented to the WN AMSA review was unlikely to have new material which would alter his conclusions in regard to the remaining two issues; the main focus of his review was the current BHPP safety management arrangements; in view of these factors, Dr Barrell chose not to read the 300-odd pages of Mr Visscher's submission. (13) Mr Visscher faxed a list of 339 documents to DPIE on 25 May 1996. The relevance of many of these documents is highly questionable. (14) (a) Yes. Mr Visscher was advised that the DPIE officer was not aware of many of the documents on Mr Visscher's list, including many of the 36 faxes from Mr Visscher to Senators Margetts, WA Greens, Mr John Prescott, CEO BHP, Senator Scott, WA Greens, and a number of other persons; the majority of the 116 letters, memos, reports, log excerpts, and personal faxes sent to Mr Visscher from a variety of sources such as BHPP, the WA regulator, various politicians, somebody named ""Brian"", and other unknown persons; the majority of the 149 pieces of correspondence from Mr Visscher to others about attending meetings, staying on leave and extending leave, updating TV commentators, informing politicians, advising about media releases, copying other faxes and correspondence to other people, conveying thanks, proposing meetings, making presentations, etc, etc; The DPIE officer was certainly aware, however, of the essential reports, interview statements, statutory declarations, comments on reports, etc, relevant to Dr Barrell's review of BHPP's safety management arrangements. (14) (b) Yes (15) (a) Yes. Dr Barrell considered all the documents necessary to meet the requirements of his Terms of Reference and the subsequent direction from the Minister for Resources and Energy Dr Barrell's Terms of Reference called for him to review BHPP's safety management arrangements relating to the Griffin Venture safety incident of 3 January 1996, and provide advice on whether those arrangements were satisfactory and whether there were any other relevant measures which could improve the safety performance of BHPP's offshore facilities; he was instructed by the Minister for Resources and Energy to take into account all other BHPP safety related incidents, including the 1994 Griffin Venture and the 23 March 1996 labiru Venture gas freeing incidents, when making his determinations and writing his report. Dr Barrell did so. In conducting his review according to his Terms of Reference and his Ministerial instructions, Dr Barrell considered an extensive range of documents ranging from official reports to additional evidence supplied by Mr Visscher. He talked to Mr Visscher himself, he viewed his video presentation and read through the video transcript. He interviewed employees on the Griffin Venture and other BHPP facilities, and BHPP management in Melbourne, Dampier and Darwin. He consulted the WA and NT regulators and AMSA. Dr Barrell more than adequately familiarised himself with the facts and circumstances surrounding the various BHPP safety incidents-including that of the gas freeing on Griffin Venture on 29 May 1994. He conducted his review according to his Terms of Reference and his instructions. (b) Dr Barrell's report is satisfactory. Dr Barrell produced a report which resulted in BHPP publicly recognising that it had deficiencies in its offshore safety managment arrangements and committing $36 million dollars to a program to rectify those deficiencies-a program which it is now well on the way to completing. This was a highly satisfactory outcome from the Government's point of view. Dr Barrell's review was not established to try to determine whether every allegation made by Mr Visscher about the May 1994 events could be substantiated. Dr Barrell's main job was to ensure that the personnel working on BHPP's facilities are not put at undue risk-now or in the future. (16) It is understood that he is employed by BHPP as a Master on the Challis Venture. (17) No. The Government has already been involved in a joint inquiry with the WA Government into the events of the 1994 Griffin Venture gas freeing incident. It has commissioned a very thorough review by Dr Barrell of the safety management arrangements of BHPP-a review which has resulted in the company expending very considerable energy and physical and financial resources examining and improving its arrangements BHPP has a comprehensive plan in place to brings its safety management arrangements to the standard of world best practice. It is paying particular attention to improving the safety culture of its offshore employees and the quality of communications between management and the offshore staff; the Government has been regularly assessing the performance of BHPP in implementing the comprehensive safety upgrade program to which it has committed itself, and is satisfied with its progress so far.
