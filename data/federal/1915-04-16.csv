26,Mr FENTON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Maribyrnong) [10.50]. - I do not know whether any explanation can be given of the reason for raising the salaries of officers in another Chamber. I would be loth to make any adverse reference to the omcers concerned, but considerable objection has been taken to the raising, unde'r the present circumstances, of the salaries of officials who are already highly paid. I , too, regard this policy as open to objection. I suppose this action has been taken in order to bring the salaries of the Senate omcers on a par with those paid to the omcers of this Chamber. would not take such serious objection to the raising of the salaries of highly-paid omcers if it were not for the fact that there seems to be a smooth passage always for the highly-salaried man to a higher salary, whilst difficulties are placed in the path of the rank and file of the service when they ask to have their meagre emoluments increased. There is the instance of the letter carriers having to fight their way through the Arbitration Court before they could obtain even a modicum of redress. I noticed that an oflicer of the Public Service Commissioner's office made a general statement before the Court that the men in the Service are slowing down, and Mr Justice Powers, in delivering his award, said that that oflicer had not given one item of evidence to support the statement he had made. I am taking advantage of this opportunity to make a reference to the position in the Service generally. There are some men in the Service who are doing valuable work, and yet who have not been - receiving fair salaries, and have not been granted an increase since they entered the Service. It is not fair at this stage to give increases to men already receiving high salaries. I understand that when certain salaries in this Chamber were increased in the last Estimates it was thought u n fair to pay. lower salaries to officers similar positions in another place, and that it was decided to grant these proposed increases at that time.",7
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,It was done then.,7
28,Mr FENTON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Yes , I believe the in creases had been paid long before these Estimates were framed. I make my protest against that policy. I have the greatest respect for the oflicers concerned, and I believe they are doing their duty reliably and well, but I am pointing out the difference in the treatment of the highly-paid men on the one hand, and those on the other hand who are earning just a meagre salary. At this time of high cost of living, if any officers are entitled to consideration, they are the lowlypaid men. - Mr KELLY - Do you suggest that Mr . MCAnderson should be paid more than 7 guineas per day?",7
29,Mr FENTON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Before I criticise that payment I desire to know what Mr . MCAnderson is doing, and if I think that I he gets too much for the work he performs, m y protest - will be heard. In regard to the oflicers of another place, however, we know the services those gentlemen perform, and I have some diffidence about criticising the increase. Mr. JOSEPH COOK . (Parramatta) [10.56] - I believe that I am the culprit in this matter.",7
30,Mr KELLY,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,Y o u bet! The honourable member would not have raised the objection if the increase had not been given from this side.,7
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"There may be something in that, because no man in the House is so keen in defending the actions of his own party, or is so quick upon the scent of anything done by members on this side, if by attacking our actions he thinks he may gain a little kudos for himself. The honourable member rose to protest against an item, and then assured us that he had no objection to it . What is the honourable member's objection about if it does not relate to this item ? If there are other high salaries he wishes to attack, why does he not enumerate them?",7
32,Mr FENTON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,I cannot attack everything under this heading.,7
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,Do I understand that the honourable member does not wish to reduce these salaries?  occupying member said that he did.,7
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Then he ought to have the pluck of his convictions and move for a reduction of the item, instead of making general statements which are only so much "" smoodge"" to the people outside. Every member knows the value and the purpose of those statements. That line of conduct earns the contempt of all manly men. The honourable member protests against the high salaries, and then says that he does not wish to reduce them.' That is typical of a lot of the reforming zeal on the Government side. The explanation of this item is very simple, but who can have anything but contempt for conduct like that of the honourable member for Maribyrnong? The honorablo member mouthed a speech about high salaries, and then said that he did not wish to touch them.",7
35,Mr FENTON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,- I did not sav anything of the kind.,8
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The explanation of this matter is very simple. last year's Estimates provision was made for an increase in the salary of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, on a joint recommendation from the then Speaker, the honourable member for Lang, and the President of the Senate, that the salaries of the clerks should be augmented. Those gentlemen pointed out that corresponding positions in the State Parliament were rated more highly than in our own, and that neither of the officers mentioned had received any increase in his salary since Federation began. They further urged very strongly that the proposed increases were long overdue. Accordingly I agreed to provide in the Estimates for the increases. Mr Speaker submitted his recommendation properly to the House, but the President omitted to formally submit the proposed increase for the Clerk of the Senate, and, consequently, the latter was not voted. Subsequently the President sent me a strong protest against the exclusion of his own officer; and, of course, I took the responsibility of correcting the error, and asking the Treasurer to provide for in creases to both clerks. ""What we are doing now is merely to regularize the payments which have how been going on for, I think, about eighteen months. Why the honourable member opposite should at this stage introduce a discussion about the Public Service, the Arbitration Court, and all the rest of it , I cannot imagine. He knows very well that such subjects have no relevance whatever to the item now before us, and he could take an opportunity later on to discuss the Public Service and other subjects. If the honourable member can show a case in which any officer has been too highly paid for his work, I think he will find some sympathetic consideration on this side. It is time we dropped what I cannot help regarding as a ""smoodge"" to people outside, and addressed ourselves seriously to the discussion of the Estimates. There is no doubt that the Estimates are swollen and high, but I guarantee that the honourable member for Maribyrnong opposite will not propose to reduce them a penny.",8
37,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Brisbane) [11.3] I am prepared to accept the challenge of the Leader of the Opposition in reference to the ""smoodging"" to people outside. Indeed, I am prepared to go further, and, if in order on the vofe before us, to move that there shall be no increase in the In salary of any officer receiving over £ 3 00 per annum, while the war lasts.",8
38,Mr RODGERS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"My word, you are game!",8
39,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I know, and this is a time which demands courage on the part of every honourable member.  favours a reduction of salaries?",8
40,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I am not suggesting any reduction, but I contend that we are not asking too much when we say that omcers with over £300 per annum shall not be entitled to any increase during the war.",8
41,Mr ATKINSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,How many officers under the - present Estimates would be affected by this motion?,8
42,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Severa l hundreds. I have gone through the list as carefully as is possible considering the way in which the Estimates are made up. If honourable members look at page 92 of the Estimates they will realise how dimcult it is to arrive at the number of officers who would be affected. It will be seen that last year there were seventy-four officers, and this year there are eighty-three, or an increase of nine, while the increase in salaries is £20,000. A similar state of affairs may be found right through the Estimates, particularly in the Defence Department, both military and naval; and it is practically impossible for honourable members to arrive at an exact knowledge of what increases are-being proposed to individual officers, or how many are affected. With' the Leader of the Opposition, I believe that we are faced with a very critical state of affairs in our national existence; and it is a time when we must have courage and confidence in ourselves, and, at the same time, some regard for the future. The honourable member for Maribyrnong does not overstate the argument, or even exhaust what might be said as to the position outside. The cost of living has increased enormously! Men who are receiving anything fro m £ 3 to £ 4 a week are finding it very difficult to make both ends meet, and a man in receipt of less than £3 a week is pushed to live within his income, and act honestly. How some of the poorer classes are able to live at the present time completely puzzles me; and the facts show that some of the ladies must be better treasurers and financiers than are the men. Officers who are in receipt of over £300 a year should, at any rate, be able without much difficulty to get along under the present circumstances. I l i m it the operation of the motion to the period of the war, because I believe that the extraordinary expenditure and the unfortunate circumstances will gradually disappear after the war is over.",8
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,There are numbers of skilled men getting over £ 6 a week; would the honourable member apply the motion to them ?,9
44,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,I would apply the motion to all omcers of the Commonwealth Public Service who are getting over £30 0 a year.,9
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The member was speaking only of salaries in the Estimates, whereas I am talking of wages.",9
46,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,I can deal only with the Estimates.,9
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Oh , I see I",9
48,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,I am sure that the honourable member does not wish to mis' lead me..,9
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Not at all, but the docks there are men getting more than £ 6 a week; what would the honourable member do with regard to them ? . Mr FINLAYSON - We are now dealing only with the' Estimates, but I should be glad later on to join with the honourable member in dealing with the case of workers outside.",9
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Why man in an office be subject to this proposed reduction, while a man outside, with perhaps no obligations, is allowed to go free?",9
51,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,S i m p l y because we are now dealing with officers affected by the Estimates.  member propose to amend the vote now before the Chair?,9
52,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"It has been a regular custom for Governments in financial difficulties to immediately make a reduction in the Public Service salaries-to resorb to retrenchment so-called-but , so far from favouring, I should oppose any such proposal, because I do not think the circumstances are severe enough to warrant it . My proposal is simply a temporary expedient to conserve the finances, and to assist the Government in their conduct of the business of the country.",9
53,Mr RODGERS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"If increases are long overdue, is not the motion tantamount to a reduction?",9
54,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The r e can be no reduction of something a man has never had. In submitting the motion, I am making no charge or suggestion against the efficiency of the officers affected. The proposal is very general in its scope, and would apply to every Department of the Public Service. It is a fair thing that all increases, even automatic increases, should be suspended for the time being.",9
55,Mr WEST,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,What about the Public Service Act?,9
56,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The Act does not matter, if Parliament refuses to pass the honourable money. Quite a large number of officers are down in the Estimates for increases of salary ranging from £ 1 0 up to £ 1 0 0 , and there is one for whom an ..increase from £50 0 to £ 7 0 0 is proposed. That is an officer on the Kalgoorlie to ..Port Augusta railway.  very able man.",9
57,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,I am sorry that the honourable member should introduce at personal considerations into the discussion.,9
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,What is tliere personal about that?,9
59,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"My desire is that this motion should be discussed on the broadest and most general lines, with no reference or application to particular in dividuals. If I were to express my own personal opinion I might, in the case of should the the officer to whom it is proposed to give an increase of £ 1 0 0 , be inclined to say that he is well worthy of it-that it is long overdue-bu t I do not wish personal considerations to enter into the matter.",9
60,Mr RODGERS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,Is the honourable member prepared to make any sacrifices himself ?,10
61,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"If the honourable member were to move an increase in our parliamentary salaries at present I should oppose it . . In the Prime Minister's Department increases are proposed for eleven offioers; in the Treasury fox seventeen officers; in the office of the Attorney-General for three omcers; in the Department of External Affairs for sixteen officers; in the Department of Trade and Customs for thirty-two officers; the Department of Home Affairs for twenty-six offioers; and in the Postmaster General's Department for forty omcers. I shall not go through the whole list in detail; but there are 183 omcers, and the amount involved is over £5,000. other Departments there are eighteen offioers receiving increases up to £100, and the amount involved there is £1,790. The question, as I say, ought to be discussed quite apart from any particular oflicer or officers; our only consideration should be the greatest good of the greatest number. I am unable at the present time to go beforo my constituents, and justify increases from £25 to £100 to officers who are receiving £600, £700, and £800 per annum, while ordinary working men, who are the great mass of the people, and on whom we have to depend to see us through the crisis by keeping our works going, have to scrape along on £ 3 or £ 4 a week, which is only too difficult to get. One of the saddest sights in the capital cities of Australia today is the procession of unemployed; and yet here we are today shovelling away money to men who are receiving in salaries practically more than they know what to do with. I should like to know, Mr Chairman, whether such a motion as I have foreshadowed is in order on the vote before us?",10
62,The CHAIRMAN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I am bound by the rules of debate, and under those rules the Committee may consider only matters Teferrcd to it. The question now before us is the expenditure in connection with the Senate; and, therefore, the motion would not be in order, inasmuch as it covers the whole of the Estimates. However, the honourable member's object might be gained by moving the reduction of one item in the vote for the Senate, the decision being accepted by the Minister as applying to the whole of the Estimates.",10
63,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I shall deal with the matter in another way. I move That the item "" Clerk of the Senate, £1,000,"" be reduced by £100. as an instruction to the Government that no increase of salary be granted during the continuance of the war to any officer of the Public Service receiving over £300 per annum. In submitting this motion, it is not my desire to single out the Clerk of the Senate for special treatment. Unless' the principle is to apply in all cases where ofBcers are receiving over £300 per annum, then I do not desire that it shall apply to the Clerk. Mr MoDONALD (Kennedy) [11.17]. - I think I shall bo able to explain this matter to the Committee. The In increases covered by this division were made, not this year, but in 1913. . In that year, this House agreed to certain items in the Estimates providing for increments to certain officers of this House. Later on, when dealing with the Estimates, the Senate felt it was in duty bound to see that its officers were similarly treated.",10
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,That is nob right. I have already explained the matter to the House.,10
65,Mr MCDONALD,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The ' President, Senator Givens, brought the matter before the Treasurer of the day.",10
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"No ; the President, Senator Givens, and the honourable member for Lang, who was then Speaker of this Houso, made a joint application to me for these increases.",10
67,Mr MCDONALD,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"But whilst the Estimates provided for increases in the case of certain officers of this - House, there were no similar items in the Estimates relating to the Senate.",10
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,It was an omission on the part of Senator Givens.,10
69,Mr MCDONALD,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I do not say whose fault it was, hut the fact remains that .these increases did not appear on the Estimates for the Senate. They were granted in 1913, however, and the money was paid out of the Treasurer's advance. It will thus He realized that, although these increased amounts appear for. the first time in the Estimates for this year, the increases .were paid in 1913-14. . Mr FISHER (Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.19],-This matter is new to me. I take no exception to the views expressed by the .honourable member for Brisbane, but it is my duty to tell the Committee that, if his motion were agreed to, the saving so effected would be practically negligible, even if the war were to continue for a considerable time. If we are going to try. tb meet the war expenditure in this way, we shall utterly fail.",10
70,Mr JH CATTS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,That is not point of the criticism.,11
71,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The point of the criticism is that, owing to the war, there should be no increments in respect of officers receiving over £300 a year. This Parliament has remitted to the Public Service Commissioner the power to make regulations providing for the payment of increments on a graduated scale according to the efficiency of officers and the .services rendered by them.. If the payment of these increments were dropped for a yearor two, the effect would, in many cases, be felt by the persons concerned, not only during the time that they were withheld, but throughout their lives. The saving would be quite paltry, and' would not be in keeping with the dignity of the' Parliament. I do not think our Arbitration Courts have seriously taken into account the refusal of increases because of the war.",11
72,Mr JH CATTS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"In New South Wales that , has been done. Mr. JOSEPH Coox --Has not that action heen withdrawn f .",11
73,Mr JH CATTS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I think not. No creases are given. Mr FISHER.*-Her e and there such action may have been taken.. I am one of the optimists, of Australia. Apart from the regrettable and deplorable dearth of remunerative employment for a_ large tion of our best people, there is no indiThus, cation of any reduced .production of wealth exwpt that resulting from the drought. Tho - Government have cona sidered the question of whether there should be a percentage reduction of salain ries or a reduction of the Public Serceiving vice, and have arrived at the conclusion that it is not advisable at present, would it be of any practical utility in financing of our war expenditure, to sort to either expedient. I wish to this opportunity to. repeat a statement that I made earlier in the session, that it will be the duty of Ihe Treasurer - future to require that all recommendaof tions by the Public Service Commissioner for the granting of increments shall he submitted to him before they are laid before Parliament, and to take any action upon it that may be thought fit. That will be done in future. I ask the honourable member for Brisbane not to press his motion. The Government' can see their way to finance the affairs of the Commonwealth without resorting to any the extraordinary means during the present financial year. If any action of the kind is to be taken, it should follow systematic lines, and should be in connection with the new Estimates, which are almost due. Nothing would give a worse impression here and elsewhere than would be gathered from the laying down of a hard and fast rule that no increments' shall be granted to officers receiving more than a certain sum per annum. The honourable memher himself, in the case of his own employees, would feel that he was as much entitled to grant increases to men receiving £6 a week, if they were doing good work, as to grant increases to men of capacity and industry who were receiving only £4 or £5 per week.",11
74,Mr THOMAS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Barrier) [11.25] I hope that the honourable member for Brisbane will not press his motion as it stands, since if it goes to a vote I shall be placed in a false position. In the first place, I am absolutely opposed to the principle that no officer receiving over in- £300 a year should be granted an increment. If a man is legitimately entitled to an increase of salary, he should receive it. The honourable member for Brisbane, however, proposes to reduce the salary of an officer who, I think, is not entitled to portho increase that has been granted him. if - I voted against the motion because I do not think all increments should be. refused to officers receiving over £300 year, I should at the same time lay myself open to the allegation that I was favour of the Clerk of the Senate re£1,000 per annum. I do not think he ought to receive this increase of £100 nor per annum. The Secretary to the Treathe sury receives £900-per annum; the Clerk reof the Senate, if this increment be contake firmed, will receive £1,000 per annum. In the name of Heaven, how can it be said that the responsibilities of the Clerk in of the Senate are greater than are those the Secretary to the Treasury! I admit that the last-named officer also receives £150 per annum as officer adminiswill tering the old-age pensions and maternity allowance, hut as Secretary to the Treasury he receives only £900 per annum. fight, you know that. That, too, is the salary received by the Secretary to the Department of Defence. I am inclined to think that the position of that officer, particularly at the present time, is just as responsible as is that the Clerk of the Senate. If we are going to give the Clerk of the Senate £1,000 year, we should increase the salaries these two officers in the same way; seeing that the Government have made no provision for such an increase in their case, they must consider that £900 annum is sufficient.",11
75,Mr RODGERS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,Would the honourable member repudiate an arrangement already high salaries. made?,12

It was with considerable diffidence I brought the matter forward at all, I think I have been subjected' to justifiable attack by the Leader of the Opposition. When I got up to speak placed the blame for this matter upon the present occupants of the Treaare sury bench. I had no idea that the ex-Prime Minister was responto be done. sible for it in conjunction with President of the Senate, but I think professions of yesterday are not being' borne out by his performances today. If he wishes this session to be continued in a spirit of peace' and amity, I he is setting a bad example. If the .

80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,I never want to,12
81,Mr FENTON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"It is all very well to apologize afterwards; but you should have apologized while you were on your feet. It seems rather peculiar that when of salaries are being talked about the word "" smoodge"" is so often used. The Leader a of the Opposition is prepared to attack of the salaries of those who are not within but, hearing, but not of those who are-h e would not "" smoodge "" for one moment.",12

83,Mr FENTON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"You speak about men who are not in this Parliament receiving I think that is showing cowardice. I 'think it would not be right to start on this question of salaries were we not to start in our own ParUaway ment. That is the reason why I approach this snbject with considerable diffidence. If the session had been continued in the ordinary way the there would, I think, have been a prothe tracted discussion upon the raising of high salaries. I intended to bring the matter up, and I was only performing of what I considered to be my duty in mentioning the matter at all, though I am not prepared to go the same length as the honourable member for Brisbane. We have heard the honourable Leader of the Opposition denouncing propositions to with all the language of his extensive to vocabulary, riddling them with criticism', but not concluding with a motion; but. not when I , a humble member, make any criticism, he says it is ""smoodging"" to those outsido, and that I should have proI say in that connection with the war that masses of and people are finding their burden heavy an unenough.

In connection with our public services things being done that ought not to he done, and things are not being done that ought The honourable member the knows. of officers occupying high and his important positions whose salaries have remained stationary ever since they have been in the Federal Service. Some men are not being paid the value of their serthink vices.

86,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The figures were given to me officiallyThe increases to officers receiving between £300 and £400 will amount to £4,236; to officers between £400 and £500, £1,426; from £500 and upwards, £587; making a total of £6,425.",13

This is merely ratifying an arrangement, as the honourable member, ought to know. But what surprises me is that a motion of this description should have come from a. gentleman who since the war started has had increases to his own salary from this Chamber in the shape of fees. If the gentleman will come along with a suggestion that his own emoluments should cease, and that members of the House should accept some reduction of their own salaries, he will have my support.",13
88,Mr CHARLTON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Hunter) [11.87] I feel in a position similar to that of the honourable member for Barrier. . The honourable member in this motion is committing us to preventing increments being paid to any civil servants. We haye, however, the Public Service Act, which provides for certain increases to.be paid to public servants from time to ""time. I have a recollection that honourable members of this House Have criticised very severely the Public Service Commissioner for not giving effect to that Act-in not providing increments to those who were entitled to them. If we carry this motion it will he taken as an instruction-to the - Government that no increases shall be paid at all, and, to my mind, such an action will not stand any test. The Act provides that the increases shall be paid, and if they are not paid the officials who are entitled to them have only to bring the matter to a test, and you will find that we have done wrong. If we pass an Act of Parliament, we ought to adhere to it . Nobody cries oub more than we do ourselves if the law is nob carried out, and yet we are here asked to carry a resolution practically setting aside an Act of Parliament regulating the salaries of civil servants. I do nob think such a proceeding would be legal, and it would leave . the. Commonwealth open to any action that might be taken by the public servants themselves; and they would be perfectly justified in taking that action. I cannot see eye to. eye with the honourable member in making his proposition apply to every one. If we had time to go through the different positions held by public servants, many cases might be found where officers were doing more for the money they are receiving than they should, and where increases are really justified. While, however, I am prepared to deal with any particular matter on its merits, I am not prepared to vote for a resolution giving an instruction to Ministers to refuse increments due to a large body of public servants.  [11.40] - So much has been already said upon this matter that I think a view ought to be expressed by each person who. intends to vote on a subject of this importance. I want to say ab the outset that I hope no Government will ever set up £300 a year as a standard of efficiency, as it would do if this motion were given effect to. The work the clerks of Parliament have to. do has been referred to, and I think quite unthinkingly.. We know if a Bill passes this House the responsibility rests upon the clerks of Parliament to see that it is given proper effect to. .A mistake made in the passing of a Bill might result in endless litigation. Consequently, work of considerable responsibility rests upon the shoulders of the clerks in this Parliament. The honourable member for Brisbane alsp suggested that the action he proposes is necessary as a result of war. Personally, I cannot follow him in that argument. I may not be as optimistic as some people, but I do not think it is the war that is troubling Australia at the present time so much as the drought. I believe that Australia will benefit as a result of the war, and I am in agreement with those honourable members who. say we are suffering a great deal more from the effects of a disastrous drought. I believe that because I come from a district where there is much suffera ing; and, in that respect, the' argument of the honourable member for Brisbane, so far as it relates to the war, falls absoture lutely flat. I am against making £300 a year a standard, and I hope this vernment and this party will never down to the level of saying that, whatever service a man renders to the Commonus wealth, £300 will be the standard of his' efficiency.",13
89,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Would that apply to honourable members?  no mention has been made of the paymotions ment of salaries of honourable members themselves. I do not want to be misbut understood in this matter. particular sympathy with those in receipt of high salaries, but when £300 is proposed as a standard, I am entirely against it. I might have been with the honourable member if he had placed the standard higher, but there are many good men i receipt of £300 a year, a sum which only gives a bare margin, and in certain i stances I can quite understand that itall does not give any margin at all. I might be with the honourable member, however, if he had applied his proposal only to highly salaried officers of the Commonwill wealth.",14
90,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Richmond) [11.43] am very glad to hear the honourable memin ber for Indi say he hopes we shall never adopt the standard of £ 3 00 as sufficient remuneration in our Civil Service. think the great trouble in our Civil vice is that we are not prepared to pay for brains. Go to the big industrial enpositions terprises of the world, look at the enorscapegoats mous salaries which they pay to those guiding the destinies of those enterthey prises, remembering that they are comtheir mercial enterprises run by men anxious to make profits out of their own money, and I think you will recognise that Australia we are not paying anything present time. like the remuneration which I believe is necessary to get the management of our national affairs into hands that will make our great business undertakings payable concerns. I venture to go further. We have not in our Civil Service, particularly in our great business undertakings, officers employed at a salary at all portionate to the tremendous responsibilipresent ties they are called upon to discharge. Take our Post Office. The Postmastercountry % General comes down here and calmly tables report which says that we are losing £500,000 a year on our Post Office! W it h all due respect to the gentleman in control of our Postal Department, I vento say that if we had in control of that Department the very best brains the Goworld could give, and were prepared to come provide the remuneration that would secure those services, though it might cost £6,000 or even £10,000 extra each year, the Department, instead of showing a loss of £500,000, would probably show a profit, whioh would be true economy from a national stand-point. When we are prepared to pay decent remuneration, such as that outlined by the honourable member for Brisbane do nothing discourage those in our great national I have no service who are striving to do their best.",14
91,Mr RILEY,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"South Sydney) [11.46] I oppose the motion. At the outbreak of the war, the Premier of New South Wales took panic, and gave instructions for the shortening of hours and the limitan tion of employment, and the mere fact of the Premier of the State having set that n - example had an exceedingly bad effect on employers in the State, and if the Commonwealth Parliament decides that there shall be no increases in the the salaries of its servants, the decision be used as a lever by Wages Boards, Arbitratio n Courts, and priI vate employers. Our finances are not such a deplorable state that we should set such a bad example. We are not in such a position that we cannot afford to I pay fair and reasonable wages to every Serclass in the community, and why should these men, if they have acquired their by their qualifications, be made because they happen to be receiving over £300 a year?

We must any remember that the Estimates were prepropared before Australia entered upon the serious conditions-certainl y the most serious it has ever encountered. The is suffering far more from the results of the disastrous drought than from the war. The four southern States-Wester n Australia, South Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania-hav e had absolutely the worse season from which they have ever suffered, and nine-tenths of the people outside the ranks of the Civil Ser-vice have had to face very serious reductions in their incomes and their salaries, and are in a worse position today than they were twenty years ago. Yet, on a drought-stricken and war-stricken community we intend to impose additional taxation. Seeing that the Estimates were prepared before the war, and before the drought, in view of these two great calamities from which the people in the four southern states have so severely suffered, the Government would have acted wisely had they considerably revised them before the meeting of the House.",14

94,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"What a recompense to the man who has to kill his stock because there is no feed is the knowledge that there is too much water at the other side of the globe!

96,Mr JH CATTS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Possibly , but not probably. But they would certainly resent increases at present. Other honourable members, perhaps, do not get each day in their mail letters such as I do from men who are out of work and in need and distress, and are pleading for jobs.. If we cannot provide sufficient work .to put bread in a man's cupboard, surely it is not the time to give an extra £ 2 a week to a person already receiving £900 a year. Such increases create very considerable irritation among the people. The honourable member for South Sydney states that he does not wish to set a bad example to private employers, but I doubt if any private employers are now giving increases to men who receive over £300 a year. If there are such cases they must be exceptional. The honourable member for South Sydney, unwittingly, I think, did injustice to the Premier of New South Wales, probably through a general misunderstanding that seems to have there come about. The honourable member said Mr Holman had taken fright, and proposed reductions in wages and hours to employers.",15
97,Mr RILEY,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,He proposed a reduction of hours.,15
98,Mr JH CATTS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,The honourable member is not putting the.matter fairly. In some cases firms employing 600 men found that as a result of the war their business decreased by a third.,15

103,Mr RODGERS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,I quite agree with you.,15
104,Mr JH CATTS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"If the honourable member for Oxley and others will hear me out, they may obtain material upon which to come to a fair conclusion on this point. In the case of an industry employing 600 men the output was diminished by a third, but under the terms of a Wages Board award the employer had no other course but to put off a third of his men, and in the circumstances a request was made that power should be given under the Wages Board award, so that instead of 200 men being put. off there could be an agreement between the 600 men for a voluntary reduction in their hours all round, thus bringing about an equal distribution of the loss of employment.",15
105,Mr RILEY,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,I was speaking of Government employee's.,15
106,Mr JH CATTS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The same thing - was done in regard to railway employees; there was a reduction of time instead of a large number of men being put off. 'The honourable member for Barrier, who is present, will know that when thousands of men were put off the mines at Broken Hill , and thrown o n the resources of the State, the Premier of New South Wales, instead of leaving all these men in want, provided that there should be a sharing of the loss of employment by a reduction of hours on railway works, in order to find employment for these Broken Hill men. 'That method was infinitely the preferable one to adopt as against the cast-iron method of some men being employed full time, and others being thrown out of employment altogether. If the Premier of New South Wales caused a reduction in wages and hours in any other way I am not aware of it . The honourable member for South Sydney, who sits by me, now tells me that he agrees with me, and that what I have outlined is quite correct. I was sure that he did not wish to do any injustice. The statement has been made that if - any increments to our civil servants are blocked, the effect will be permanent on the officers concerned. When, through the dissolution of Parliament, we lose so many weeks' salary from time to time we suffer a permanent loss. If a man loses - employment, he can never make good the consequent loss of wages, however hard he may work in the future.  a permanent reduction in salary for the remainder of the term of service.",16
107,Mr JH CATTS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I do not agree with the Prime Minister. If there were an arrangement that, when the officer whose - salary is in question had received £1,000, he was to have his salary increased next .year by £100, and by another £100 a year after, that officer would be affected permanently, and it may be that there are officers in the Service who were appointed on. the distinct understanding that they would receive regular increases until a - certain maximum was reached. is the difficulty in the way of the acceptance of the amendment, the Government would be - well advised to postpone the - consideration of the matter, to give time for investigation, so that the cases in which injustice would be done could be made known. A number of honourable gentlemen who have spoken to the amendment seem to be in harmony with its mover on many points, but have stated that they will not vote for it because it does not exactly meet their views. Probably no proposal ever comes before a . Parliament that exactly meets the views of every honourable member who supports it, and we are forced generally to take the nearest expression of our views that we can obtain. Although the amendment does not quite represent my views, I shall vote for it , because, at a time when the Government cannot find money to provide work for the unemployed, and to carry on necessary public undertakings, public servants whose salaries are well above the living wage should not be given increases. , I hope that the honourable member for Brisbane will stick to his guns, and will give honourable members an opportunity 'to show their constituents what are their real views on this matter. If the amendment goes to a vote, I , for one, shall support it .",16
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,Parramatta) [12.5] - The honourable member for Bris - 1 bane has notdone wisely in choosing an item of Senate expenditure to test the feeling of the Committee .regarding the matter on which he has spoken. The Senate in sists that it has the right to fix the salaries of its officers. The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives hold that it is for them to fix the salaries of the omcers of theii Departments.,16
109,Mr THOMAS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,It is for them to ask for what amounts they wish; but it is for the Parliament to say what sums shall be granted.,16
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"No doubt; but if we amend a Senate proposal, bhat Chamber may delay the passing of the Estimates.",16
111,Mr JH CATTS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,Will the honourable member support the amendment if it is moved on another item ? Mr JOSE PH COOK - No . My sugI f that gestion is made merely to help the honourable member for Brisbane to test the feeline of the Committee. The President of the Senate wrote to me a very strong protest against the leaving of this increase off the last Estimates.,16
112,Dr MALONEY,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,There is no similar increase in the Estimates of the House of Representatives - a thorough,17
113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"No . creases of the House of Representatives were passed on the last Estimates. When the increases were agreed to, the honourable member for Lang, who was then Speaker, revised his Estimates, but the President omitted to do the same. Both Senator Givens and the honourable member for Lang wrote protesting against the omission of the Senate increases, but when we promised to pay them out of the Treasurer's Advance, as a mistake had been made, the President and the members of the Senate were mollified. There will be plenty of opportunities for testing the question which the honourable member for Brisbane wishes to raise; though I should like to draw attention to the absolute f u t i l it y of his proposal. Members sitting near hinf, who have been in Parliament many more years than he has, have seen many attempts like his fail , and must know that what he proposes can achieve nothing. The Prime Minister has told him that the amount involved is negligible. His desire is that the men at the top should contribute specially to the cost of the war. But he discriminates among such men, which is unjust. There are men working for wages for the Government who receive more than £ 6 a week, and his proposal would not affect them. Why should they be treated differently fro m men who are working for salaries? There are men at the docks, at the Small Arms Factory, and elsewhere whose wages come to more than £ 6 a week. Why should they be treated differently from other workers whose remuneration is termed "" s a l a r y "" ? one but the Government can undertake the reduction of items in the Estimates. I am not sure that the whole of the Estimates do not need revision. There is an increase of about £2,000,000 this year, and I do not know where we are going to stop, though I cannot point off-hand to the source of the trouble. What is needed is patient and continuous investigation, and I hope that the inquiries of our Committees and other investigations will enable us to pare down the cost of administration without decreasing efficiency or lowering salaries. I have never been in favour of cutting down salaries, holding the opinion that, as a rule, the higher the wage paid the more effective is the labour given. But I am not in consistent in saying thab there should be investigation of the Estimates The in - as a whole, in view of the large increase of expenditure on the ordinary departments of Government. What the honourable member for Brisbane proposes would not make any material reduction. At best it would reduce an increase of over £2,000,000 by £60,000 or £70,000.",17
114,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"B y only £6,200.",17
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"That makes it the more ludicrous. The honourable member for Brisbane ought to raise the question some other way. If he does so, the Government may be able to do something to give effect to his views.",17
116,Mr THOMAS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,Are we to understand that the honourable member for Parramatta was officially informed by the Senate that that body would delay the Estimates if this increase were not provided for?,17
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The threat was not made in exact words, but the hint was conveyed. The honourable member for Maribyrnong said that I was will in g enough to cut down the.salaries of officers who were not in the Chambers. That is an absolute and unqualified misstatement, and I am not going to allow the honourable member to send out to his constituents "" gags "" of that sort. If the honourable member for Brisbane wishes to undertake a thorough revision of this expenditure, he should raise the question in another way. He might move a motion on some otlier item in another Department, and let the decision of the Committee be an instruction to the Government to reduce these Estimates, but what the honourable member is proposing now No is to do an absolute injustice. There are a number of officers in the Service who are getting £300 per annum. The honourable member's idea is that a man receiving £280 may have his salary increased to £300, but the man already receiving £300 shall get no increase. The effect of that would be to place two different grades on the same salary, so that one man might be controlling others, and yet receiving no greater pay.",17
118,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,That would apply if we drew the line at £900.,17
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"It would, and there is only one just thing - to do, and that is to make sure that we get the equivalent of the salaries we pay.",17
120,Mr FISHEE,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Prime Minister and Treasurer-Wid e Bay) [12.18] - I take this opportunity of communicating to the Committee the following official figures regarding the increases in salaries in this and previous years. In 1910-11 the nominal increase in salaries was £12,070, and the actual increase £11,724; in 1911-12, nominal increase £14,424, actual £13,888; 1912-13, nominal increase £15,431, actual £14,781; 1913-14, nominal increase £25,896, actual £25,055; 1914-15, nominal increase £19,404, actual £18,546. The difference between the nominal and actual increases is accounted for by the fact that some of the omcers provided for were not employed until a later period than was estimated. following increased amounts were provided for officers of all divisions within the range of salaries mentioned: - Between £200 and £300, £12,297; between £300 and £400, £4,236; between £420 and £500, £1,426; and between £520 and upwards, £587. From those figures it will be seen that the total of increments to officers receiving over £300 was £6,249.",18
121,Sir JOHN FOEEEST,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Swan) [12.20], - I hope the honourable member for Brisbane will not proceed with his proposal, because it has been the custom ever since this Parliament was brought into being for the Speaker and President and the Clerks of both Houses to be on an equality in regard to salaries, and I believe there is on record a resolution of the Senate insisting upon equal treatment in that respect. I believe the custom is the same in all the Parliaments of Australia. These increases appear on the Estimates now in accordance with the promise of the previous Government to comply with the request of the Speaker and President in regard to the salaries of the oflicers concerned. It is not easy, nor is it I think usual, for any Government to refuse compliance with the wishes of the President and Speaker in regard to the salaries of Parliamentary officers-in fact, they look upon the Parliamentary vote as being independent of the Government of the day. Those officers, they say, are especially the servants of Parliament, and Parliament, not the Government, must look after their interests. My experience has been that when any such question comes before Parliament, the House always sides with the Speaker and President against the Government. Therefore it is the wish of every Government to comply, as far as possible, with the wishes of the responsible officers of the Senate and House of Representatives. That the increases were not granted to the Senate oflicers at the same time as they were granted to the oflicers of this Chamber was due solely to an inadvertence; fresh Estimates were not sent forward by the Senate, although they were sent forward by the House of Representatives. As soon as this omission was pointed out to «-the Government, it agreed to rectify the disparity which had been created. If would point out to honourable members that, however much they may*claim that this House is The supreme in regard to the Estimates, in practice that is not found to be so. We desire the assistance of the Senate in every way, and if it is the wish of the Senate that tliese increases be paid, I am willing to grant what is asked. I hope we shall not open up any dispute between the two Chambers in regard to the salaries of their respective officers.",18
122,Dr MALONEY,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Melbourne) [12.25]. - I understand that the honourable member for Brisbane has taken action today in order to give expression to an idea in regard to salaries that is permeating Australia. After a long experience of political life, I think I may fairly say that those omcers who are in contact with honourable members, and particularly those in Departments who come into contact with Ministers, have rapid advancement, as a rule, and frequently are placed over men who are their seniors, and equally competent to carry on the work. There are Departments of the Commonwealth Service in which the officials are not receiving fair salaries, and I think that the present method of granting increases does require careful consideration, in order that we may introduce a more, direct and equitable system. Any official who is in receipt of a salary of £500 and upwards is very well able to meet the exigencies of the present extraordinary situation. I would remind the right honourable member for Swan that this House is all powerful in this matter, and I personally have no regard for the precedents of past Parliaments. Although it may be difficult for honourable members who are brought into contact with oflicers to refuse them increments thab they desire, it must be remembered that there are other omcers whom we never meet, who do splendid work, who perhaps never even have a conversation with a Minister, and by that very absence of contact lose their chance of promotion. I think this discussion has raised a greater question than can be settled on a single item of the Estimates. It is a matter sufficiently important for the House to take into full consideration, so that no member of the Public Service may feel that h© has been passed over unjustly in favour of some other official with whom a Minister has come closely in contact. I believe that in the Home Affairs Department two officers have been unjustly promoted over other officers who had been longer in the service, and were more deserving. One officer today is receiving much less than his abilities and past work entitle him to. My remarks on this subject have particular reference to two Liberal Ministries of the past.  discussion appears to have arisen from a statement of the honourable member for Maribyrnong, in reference to the increment granted fifteen months ago to the Clerk of the Senate. Honourable bers opposite have on every platform advocated the principle of equal pay for equal work; and if that holds good in the case of the working classes, it ought to hold good in the case of the high officials of the Commonwealth.",18
123,Mr HIGGS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"What does the honourable member mean by ' ' working classes "" ? It is a most objectionable expression! ",19
124,Mr HIGGS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Is the honourable member referring to himself?  myself. At all events, would the honourable member for Capricornia, who receives £60 0 a year, be content with a resolution of this Housa that I should receive £700 a year ?",19
125,Mr HIGGS,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"If the honourable member were paid by results, £ 7 0 per year would be ample for him.  telligent electors of Calare think otherwise, and the average intelligence of my electors far exceeds that of the honourable member. If it be proper to pay tha Clerk of the House of Representatives his present salary, it is only just that the Clerk of the Senate should receive similar emolument-equa l work deserves equal pay. As to the proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane, no one can seriously think that at the present moment the Government contemplate entering upon an orgy of extravagance. This is no time to give all kinds of increments to public servants, considering that we are going through one of the worse droughts we ever had.",19
126,Mr WEST,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Rubbish !  However, at such a time as this, we should give the Government all reasonable support, leaving increments and similar matters to their intelligence and good sense. In my opinion it would be very unwise to adopt the motion of the honourable member for Brisbane. If there were a brilliant young fellow drawing £300 a year in the Public Service, and it was felt desirable to promote him to another position in another Department, carrying with it an increment of £ 1 0 0 a year, surely it would be good policy to make the promotion. In my opinion the motion, if passed, would very much i m pair the efficiency of the Public' Service.",19
127,Mr KELLY,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Wentworth) [12.36] The little exhibition we have had this mem- morning is, to my mind, proof, if any were needed, that Parliament is essentially and entirely an inconsistent place. In three minutes we passed a resolution for a Supply Bill involving £3,500,000 without any discussion, and now we have honourable members opposite holding up the Estimates of their own Government, and detaining us for hours, while we discuss whether some item shall be reduced by £100.",19
128,Mr BUBCHELL,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,We are discussing a principle.,19
129,Mr KELLY,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"And what is thab principle? The motion is to reduce this particular officer's salary by £ 1 0 0 ; and in the abstract th© object of the honourable member for Brisbane is to see that no man gets a permanent salary of more than £30 0 a year. Does the honourable member intend the motion to also cover temporary assistants in the. Public Service? Take the case of Mr MCAnderson, who is a member of the same party as that to which honourable members opposite belong.",19
130,Mr FINLAYSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,He is an intelligent man.,19
131,Mr KELLY,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"B e in g an intelligent man, he is held to be entitled, when out of a job, to a fee of seven guineas a day without comment; but, should he not be a member of the party opposite, or if his views are not the views of that party, his much smaller salary is to be cut down by £100 a year. Why not treat everybody in identically the same way, whether of the Labour Party or not? Why not treat all according to the same "" principle,"" which was the word used by an honourable member opposite when I asked the honourable member what he was really after? The honourable member for Brisbane states that he has no objection to Mr Boydell, but, at the same time, he moves that Mr Boydell's salary be. reduced. This reminds rae of another motion which was moved by the honourable member for Brisbane, and was the occasion of much wordy warfare, voicing his particular objection to an institution of this House. The honourable member moved the complete abolition of that in stitution, but it is still here.  the 6 o'clock rule applied to that institution now.",19
132,Mr KELLY,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Then all I can say is that, if that happen, we shall soon have a movement in favour of day sittings! I ask the honourable member to realise that the motion he has submitted is not fair, but seems to pick' out in the most invidious way a particular officer. The proposal cannot have a general application of any utility, because, after all, the Government are from day to day - appointing men at very high salaries to do specific work. If the Government are allowed freedom of action in regard to putting their own supporters outside into the fattest billets offering, it is not reasonable to propose to cut down the salaries of in dividual officers in the way now suggested. However, I am satisfied that the House will stand behind this particular officer, and see that he gets the same salary as the occupant of another similar, position. This gentleman is doing good work, and I hope he will not be victimized in consequence of any f a d or any desire for cheap advertisement outside.",20
133,Mr YATES,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Adelaide) [12.41] - I had not intended to speak, but, under the circumstances, I desire to show exactly where I stand. The honourable member for Wentworth has not done the honourable member for Brisbane justice in charging him with having singled out any one in dividual. H a d the honourable member [88] been present when the motion was submitted he would have known that the mover was confined to one particular item. The principle behind the motion has much to commeud it ; at any rate, to the. electors of Australia. As the honourable member for Cook has said, the increases in„ salaries proposed in the Estimates have shocked the electors; and as to this view I can at least speak on behalf of my own district. While reductions in wages and so forth are taking place in every walk of life, we are asked to docilely approve of increases to public servants. It has beeu suggested by some honourable members that the motion means robbing people of what is rightly theirs, but we must remember that the operation of the motion isconfined to the duration of the war.  orable member agree with private employers who cut down salaries?",20
134,Mr YATES,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The motion does not propose to cut down salaries, but merely to stop increases, and there are very few private firms who have given any in creases during the present war. On the other hand, in many cases wages and salaries have been cut down, and further, the time of employment has been reduced, even by a Government. The burden of the war is fallin g heavily on the working section of the community, using the words in their narrowest or industrial sense. These people are feeling the pinch very much; and I know that, in my own district, at any rate they are wondering how much more they will be asked to bear. The unfortunate lot of some of the women whose supporters have gone to the fron t has been brought prominently under notice in my constituency; and the people of Adelaide are beginning to rise in in dignation because of the fact that a section of the community have to be fed with bread from the Trades H all . In the case of one woman, I was told that, in the absence of her husband at the front , she was given an allowance of £ 1 Is . , out of which she had to pay 10s. for rent; and her position may be realized when it is known that she has six children to support. I made inquiries at the Defence Department as to whether that was the maximum allowance, and I was told that it was; and I understand that the woman has had to apply to those controlling the Patriotic Fund. In supporting this amendment, we do not desire to attack any individual salary. While I cannot go as far as the honourable member for Brisbane has done in fixing a certain margin, I feel that, in supporting his proposal,we shall only voice the opinion of our constituents that, while those enjoying high salaries have not been called upon to submit to any reduction, the pinch of the war is being felt by those able to bear it. The burden of the war is not being equitably borne. We have passed Works Estimates for £4.,300,000 in respect of the current financial year, but, although eight months of the year have elapsed, only £1,500,000 of that amount has yet been expended. We feel that sufficient is not being done for those who have to succour the women and children left behind by our soldiers. I do not wish to see any man underpaid. Such a thing is foreign to the desire of honourable members on this side; but when sacrifices have to be made, we wish the burden to be equitably distributed. By agreeing to this proposed vote without offering any protest, we should not be doing our duty to our constituents.  all due respect to the mover of this amendment, I cannot refrain from expressing - the opinion that it is a somewhat hollow pretence. He cannot hope to accomplish what he claims will follow the acceptance of his amendment, and, in the light of recent happenings, it is certainly a very hollow proposal. Only yesterday we were informed that the Treasurer had agreed to pay a fee of £7 7s. per day to an examiner of accounts.",20
135,Sir JOHN FOKHEST,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"He is to receive a fee of £ 8 8s. per day when away from home.  tion, I admit, is only a temporary one. T had expected the Government to come down with a comprehensive scheme for equalizing conditions. It is notorious that we members of Parliament, at £600 a year, are receiving much more than we would if conditions were equalized. If the Government intend to equalize conditions, then , I shall be with them. I dare say I should not have seen the inside of this chamber but for my association with the Kvabram movement, which was primarily an attack upon the tall poppies of the Public ""Service. I am, therefore, in sympathy ^vith any movement to prevent those who have a little more than they want receiving still more while there are in the community many who are receiving less than they actually need. In consequence of the war and the drought, the conditions in Australia are bad all round, but the position is worse in the States that are under Labour dominance. There is good reason least for the Labour party to be restive, but they should give expression to their restiveness in Caucus, where their protests would have some effect in inducing the Government to bring down a comprehensive scheme. If they did that, they would show that they were in earnest. The Labour Government in Western Australia has proposed a reduction of salaries in respect of the very class that they were supposed to uphold and benefit. In the West Australian of 24th ult. there appears this statementA railway employee at Brown Hill summed up the position when he stated that last fortnight his pay was £5 17s. 6d., in place of £7 ls. 3d. That means that he is receiving l is . 10Jd. per week less than was previously paid to him. The actions of the State Labour Government have brought about conditions which make such an imposition upon the workers a necessity.",21
136,Mr BUBCHELL,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,Does the honourable member blame the State Government of Western Australia for the drought?  conditions prevailing there.  much incapacity.,21
137,Mr BUBCHELL,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"That is only the honourable member's opinion.  the country that certain tall poppies of the Service are receiving increments while reductions are made in the pay of the more poorly-paid men, it will be recognised that there is a screw loose somewhere, seeing that we have in power a Government whose special appeal to the people was that, if returned, they would equalize conditions. The Onposition have promised to assist the Government in every proposal incidental to the war, and we shall be found behind them in every proposal that will benefit the great mass of the people. When, however, they put forward a sham, they cannot expect us to support them.",21
138,Mr BOYD,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Henty) [12.52] - I shall support the Government in their 'opposition to the amendment, since I am one of those who believe that if a man properly does the work set to his hand he should be properly paid for it . I do not believe in setting up a high standard for the vice and expecting to get at an inferior salarv men with the qualifications necessary to maintain that standard. If the Governinjustice ment, in their wisdom, have seen fit to increase the salary of the officer under discussion-and I understand that it was increased last year to make it of a parity with the salary of the Clerk of this House - the n the Committee sbould ratify their action. As I understand the amendamendment ment, the honourable member for Brisbane proposes that no officer in receipt of salary of more than £300 a year shall receive an increment during the continuwar, ance of the war. If a man in the Public Service is due, under the regulations, an increase of salary during the currency of the war, surely there is no reason it should not be paid. He must earned it , and if he has, surely the partu should be willing to pay it .",21
139,Mr BURCHELL,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,Is there any Public Stervice regulation providing for automatic increases for officers receiving -£300 a year?,22
140,Mr BOYD,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"There is a practice is far more effective.. The honourable memof ber for Adelaide says that we ought carry .this amendment, otherwise his constituents will receive a shock. They are evidently accustomed to such things. They got the shock of their lives last month when the whole State of South Australia, with the exception of the orable member's constituency, expressed itself in favour of closing all hotels 6 p.m., so that the honourable member's argument that this amendment should carried, otherwise his constituents receive a rude shock, must go by the this kind. board.",22
141,Mr MCGRATH,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Ballarat) [12.55] In my opinion, officers of the Public vice receiving £900 per annum are well paid, and there is no necessity to increase their remuneration, as proposed in this case, to £1,000. I cannot support amendment as if stands, but if the orable member for Brisbane proposed that the salary of this officer sliould be reduced to £900 per annum, I should be prepared to vote for it . I have no sympathy the contention that because the President and Mr Speaker suggested this increase we must therefore vote for it . I have - to justify before my constituents every vole that I give in this Chamber, and I . claim my right as a member of Parliament to have a voice and a 'vote in the Serdetermination of what increases shall be paid to officers of ""the Public Service. By carrying this amendment we might do an to many officers of the Service. It is obvious that we should be calling upon one section of the Service to contribute heavily to th© cost of the war whilst another section--thos e already in receipt of £1,000 a year-woul d not be required to make any contribution whatever. The would deprive every oflicer in receipt of, say, £ 3 0 1 per annum of the a right to obtain an increment of, say, £ 2 0 per annum during the continuance of the although under the Public Service regulations he might be entitled to it . for He would thus be paying £ 2 0 per annum towards th© cost of the war, while why an oflicer receiving £1,000 per annum, have who was not entitled to any increment, Laboui would escape. I do not think the honourable member for Brisbane could have had any such intention in his mind when he submitted this proposition. I shall say no more, as I understand that it is over desired to take a vote before we adjourn for lunch. I am prepared to vote for an which amendment to reduce by £100 the salary this oflicer, because. I think that £ 9 0 0 to a year is suflicient for th© office.",22
142,Mr ATKINSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Will m o t ) [12.58] I think the Committee should r at i fy the action of the Government.

It would be most unbe wise for the Committee to pass without! will proper consideration an amendment of If we did, we might find ourselves in conflict with the Public Service Act, and hittin g public servants in a Serway that we should not desire. I do noil think it is the wish of the honourable member for Brisbane that public servants shall be required to take less than the the remuneration to which they are legally honentitled; but if the amendment were carried, it seems to me that a difficulty would arise in connection with the Act i v self. It might, for instance, make it i m with possible during the continuance of the war for an officer in receipt of £ 3 0 0 per annum to be promoted to a higher class to which a higher salary was attached. The amendment is really unnecessary* . The Treasurer has told us that its adoping tion would result in a total saving of £6,000.

I take this opportunity of honourable members why this money is required now. If honourable members w i look at the Estimates, they will see that do us any harm. it was calculated, when they were first submitted, that the war expenditure would amount to £9,800,000. As a matwill ter of fact, up to the present time has been expended the sum of £7,425,000, and there is wanted over this amount .the sum of £3,130,000, making a total of £10,555,000, or an excess beyond the total amount provided for in the Estivance mates of £755,000. Honourable members will remember that there was a message fro m His Excellency the Governor-Genewhole ral, covering further expenditure £7,500,000. That gave authority to liament to proceed with the amount on iho Estimates, plus £3,500,000, while we are asking now for £3,130,000, as I will explain. It may be pointed out that - previous estimate of £9,800,000 was passed on the assumption that approximately 42,000 troops would be despatched by the end of June next. As a matter fact, however, more than 45,000 men have already been despatched on active servantage. .vice, and there are 25,000 men undergothe training in Australia, and these it is only expected will be sent away before the end sacriof June, making a total of over 70,000 during the financial year. be Naturally, when honourable members hear n that, they will not desire any further exn - planation, but may I embrace this opporof tunity just to bring under the notice of has honourable members how the British Government are dealing with this question.

This further amount I am asking for, I think, will coyer the of our expenditure up to 'the end of of June; but, if it does not, I presume Parhonorable members are like the Government, and that they will be ready to vote any further necessary expenditure if it is in the direction of providing more effecthe tively for shortening the war.",23

We recognise that we are fighting for our existence, and we are - quite willing to assist in carrying on the King's Government and in doing all that we can to assist the Mother Country. The only matter to which I take exceptionand it is more a matter of account than anything else-is that there seems to be a disposition to mix up in the Treasury - accounts the expenditure for war and the expenditure for ordinary purposes. I think that is undesirable. I know the position, and I have spoken to the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Allen, about it, and he has explained to me the difficulty, which, I have no doubt, is a real one. But while the system is convenient to the Treasury, I do not think it is so - convenient to the members of the House or to the public generally.",23
152,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Does the honourable member suggest anything? Sir JOHN"" FOBREST - I understand that the expenditure on the war has been paid from loan funds provided by arrangement with the Imperial Government. They borrow for the Commonwealth, and we have to undertake to repay them and pay interest meanwhile.",24
153,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"That is correct. Sir JOHN"" FORREST - That is quite satisfactory. But all the money that we Teceive from the Imperial Government under this arrangement of loan money is taken into the ordinary current account of revenue, and, in fact, carried to revenue.",24
154,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,I think that is statutory.,24
155,Sir JOHN FORREST,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"There should, I think, be some means provided for dividing what is war expenditure and what is ordinary expenditure. Take a ship of war-th © Australia, for instance. There is a good deal of ordinary expenditure in that. There is also a considerable amount due to the war. It is not easy to divide it , and no doubt there is difficulty in the way. The expenditure has to be divided hereafter if it is - not divided as we go along. Such a system as the honourable member indicated is adopted in the various States, where loan expenditure is charged against loan funds, and ordinary expenditure against revenue account. That system has been - adopted all over Australia, and I do not see why some means of similarly dividing the expenditure could not have been devised by us. We should have loan Estimates for loan expenditure, and ordinary Estimates for ordinary expenditure, instead of which we are treating the whole of this as ordinary revenue expenditure. We want to avoid making charges against revenue when they are properly charges for loan, regarding which we have to pay interest and sinking fund. I only mention the matter to my right honourable friend so that he may give it his attention.",24

157,Sir JOHN FORREST,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"There may be some means of dividing the expenditure hereafter if it cannot be done as we go along. I should like to see th© two things kept separate, so that we may know what we have spent on the war which is properly chargeable to loan, and what we have to charge against the ordinary revenue. As far as I am concerned, with my colleagues on this side of the House, we are only too willing to assist the right honourable gentleman in every way to carry out the duties and obligations which we owe to ourselves and to the Empire in this awful and terrible crisis.",24

Apparently the Prime Minister has, in these figures which he has given us, simply included the pay of the Expeditionary Forces which appear on page 65 under two items, and has left all the other items alone.",24
159,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,Thes e are the Treasury figures that have been handed to me.,24
160,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Pag e 65 of the Estimates of expenditure shows similar items which go to make up the estimated expenditure consequent upon the war, which is set down at £11,742,050, which expenditure is shown elsewhere as being provided out of loan money. Now, I wish to know whether this additional sum of £3,130,000, which raises the estimate of expenditure on the Expeditionary Forces to £10,555,000, is to be spent solely on the two items which appear in the Estimates as "" Expeditionary Forces "" i",24

163,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I cannot say. The best method is to vote so much for training camps, and distribute the expenditure in the best way we can.",25
164,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I was merely endeavouring, following upon the lines taken up by the right honourable member for Swan, to ascertain whether the war expenditure is being kept separate, as far as the Treasury accounts can do so, from the ordinary expenditure of the year.",25
165,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"As far as fairly strong language can induce the officers to do so, that is being done.",25

168,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"When the Estimates were presented to us, and were previously under consideration, I felt that the amount set aside' for Expeditionary Forces was hardly sumcient-in fact, did not amount to what we might reasonably be called upon to expend in doing our fair share in the war.

I take it that there is £18,000,000 to come from the Imperial Government, the whole of which amount will pass on to the States by the end of the calendar year.",25
170,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,They will get an amount equal to the sum we receive.,25
171,Mr GLYNN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I find that the total estimated expenditure provided for is £37,583,715, and that the estimated receipts for the financial year are £36,361,314, including £10,500,000 from the war loan from the British Government. Assuming that the additional £6,500,000 for the Expeditionary Forces, and £3,5""00,000 for works, promised by the Imperial Government, do not come to hand, we arrive at a sum of £10,000,000, which the Treasurer could not balance, without borrowing the £10,000,000 from the banks. We have had to arrange with the banks tolend us in exchange for notes about £10,000,000 from their reserves, which they very badly need for imports.",25
172,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I hope the honourable member will not go into that matter. The banks entered very cheerfully intothe agreement, by which they benefited as much as we did.",25
173,Mr GLYNN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I saw, at the time, one or two of the bankers, and I confess that it seemed to me more like reluctance than cheerfulness. Without borrowing that £10,000,000 from the banks free of interest we could not have carried on on the Budget presented last year. Actually only £3,000,000 of that £10,000,000 from the banks has been taken up at the present time.",25
174,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,We could have taken more.,25
175,Mr GLYNN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I understand that it is all at command, but the money is advanced only until the end of the war, and to me the position looks dangerous. The note issue, which must be taken into consideration in the financing of the war expenditure, is £26,664,323, and the gold held is £10,109,165, of which £3,000,000 presumably is money borrowed from the banks. The Treasurer admitted in his statement the other day that in order to - increase the volume of the note issue by £10,000,000 more he must avail himself of the £7,000,000 not as yet drawn from the banks, and he proposed to extend the note issue to between £40,000,000 and £50,000,000.",25
176,Mr RILEV,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,That depends upon how long the war will last.,25
177,Mr GLYNN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The position may get much worse if the war extends, and we will need to borrow more;, but no matter how our expenditure may increase, we -.should know exactly what we are driving at. Our aim may be defeated by circumstances, but we should be able to state approximately in advance the revenue we - expect from certain sources, and the expenditure we must be prepared to meet. I cannot conceive from the memorandum of the Treasurer what our position will be at the end of the year. We are actually - carrying on by borrowing to some extent from the banks.",25
178,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The honourable member might raise this discussion better on a general debate. At any time. I shall be glad to afford him a day on which to - debate the matter, but today we are dealing with a special war vote. Mr Glynn"" - Minister s should know - of any apprehension that exists in the minds of the Opposition.",26
179,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,There can be none in connection with this war vote.,26
180,Mr GLYNN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The question before us is in relation to a sum which is portion of the total amount of £28,000,000 that is to be got from the Imperial Government, as now disclosed by the memorandum which the Treasurer has placed before us. The additional borrowing is to - be for additional expenditure in connection with the Expeditionary Forces, and we are now asked to sanction part of that additional expenditure, and I ask for a particular explanation as to how we are going to carry on. Undoubtedly the note issue is increasing out of proportion to the reserve. When the war is over we shall find that we cannot contract this great volume to.the normal conditions of a note issue without a great strain on our fluid assets. The banks may require their £10,000,000 at any moment, and at present our gold reserve is only £7,000,000, if we leave out of consideration the £3,000,000 received from the banks. As a matter of fact, the disproportion between the gold reserve and the volume of the note issue is increasing. On the 29th December last, the note issue was £16,365,336, and we held against it gold valued at £7,016,216, and there was about £9,300,000 odd which was uncovered and available for investment with the States on interest-bearing loans which produce a profit. The Treasurer made a statement which I saw in the press on the 3rd March, and he gave the total volume of note issue as £25,232,463, and the gold reserve at £10,133,227. Now, with practically the same gold, we have nearly £1,600,000 added to the issue, and we are only commencing. We are increasing the volume by the ordinary payments for public purposes, and as that increase goes on we shall arrive at a stage when the gold reserve will be nearly 25 per cent.",26
181,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,Not while I am at the Treasury.,26
182,Mr GLYNN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I hope not. We can never be secure if we approach the statutory limit. As a matter of fact, the Bank of England now has a much smaller note issue than the gold held against it. I have the figures for the Reichsbank, the Bank of France, and the Bank of England. Not even the Reichsbank, with its volume of £250,000,000 before the war, has in reserve only the proportion of gold that we have. I am not going to surmise from what sources the gold reserves of Germany have been obtained. We must be very careful in the financing of the note issue. The total issue of the Reichsbank at the end of last December was £250,000,000, and there was a total reserve of 59 per cent., with a gold cover of 42 per cent. The American banks under the banking system of last year are supposed to have a cover of 42 per cent. I do not wish to be led into a discussion as to how it is that the Reichsbank has got that money. As a matter of fact, it is at the present time a. subject of inquiry, and people do not know whether the money has been lent by Austria or not.",26
183,Dr MALONET,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,The honourable member takes no notice of current accounts and deposits.,26
184,Mr GLYNN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I amnot eliminating or disregarding any factor affecting my argument. There is a banking system in Germany on which I have not touched, though I am aware of its relations with the central bank.",26
185,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,The honourable and learned member has cast a doubt on the note issue.,26
186,Mr GLYNN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,No ; what I say is that we must be careful.,26
187,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,More careful than we are now ?,26
188,Mr GLYNN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I have not said that anything wrong has been done up to the present time. My complaint is that the figures do not throw sufficient light on method proposed for balancing at the end of the year. The right honourable gentleman admits that the note issue is likely to expand to £40,000,000, and it is not clear how, if that happens, he will be able to keep a gold reserve which will maintain even the statutory backing of 25 per cent, to which we ought never to approach. There has been a large increase in the volume of the note issue, and I acknowledge that in war times the increase above the normal volume demanded by commerce must be substantial. There was a temporary increase in Great Britain, but it, as a substantial addition, lasted only for a few weeks. I do not wish to go into the commercial side of the question. I do not in any way condemn the financing of the right honourable member, but I repeat the expression of disquiet which I and others uttered some six months ago as to what may occur if there is a very large increase in - the volume of the note issue, and it should become necessary to reduce that volume to something like what was the normal limit before the war. How can that be done without destroying the gold reserve? If you have to depend on a gold reserve, the greater part of which is at the call of the banks, under the arrangement _ you have made with them, the position may become, not serious in regard to our solvency, but embarrassing to the Treasury.",26
189,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [2.50] - I regret that this question should have been raised on this particular occasion, when, as I have already explained, the Committee is being asked to sanction expenditure necessitated by the hurrying away of a larger expeditionary force than was anticipated when the original Estimates were tabled. We require a special appropriation, amounting to £3,500,000, plus the amount provided for already, to enable the present estimated expenditure to be met. No man in the country can tell whether this sum will be sumcient to meet our requirements to the end of June, but the estimate is the best that the Defence Department can make, and I am sure that I speak for Parliament when I say that if more men can be provided more money will be supplied. No one would welcome more than I should a discussion of the financial position and of the best manner of the financing Government operations during these dimcult times. I join issue with the honourable member for Angas on his statement that the private banks, which have been generous and straightforward in their transactions with me, are in any way embarrassed or suffering injustice, or weaker because of the arrangement with me.",27
190,Mr GLYNN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I spoke of their operations in regard to the financing of importations, and my remarks were based on some authority.",27
191,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The honourable member does not wish me to turn aside from the direct question of the financing of the Commonwealth to discuss whether the margin of exchange lies here or in Great Britain. One of the difficulties of the position was that the rate of exchange was against Australia, and we had to consider how best to get over that difficulty. The proposition was that the Commonwealth should raise money in London, if possible. I suggested that we should appeal to the British Government for a loan of £18,000,000 for war purposes if the banks would co-operate with us and give us a loan of £10,000,000. I thought that in that way we could finance the States and get rid of the exchange difficulty. It is a remarkable fact that', immediately the transaction was carried out, the financial credit of Australia altered, and every person interested infinanceconsidered that the trouble was ended, not for a day, but for a year, and, perhaps, until the end of the war. The banks have given us £3,000,000 in pursuance of an arrangement with the Commonwealth whereby both their interests and ours were protected. I have expressed, again and again, my opinion of their patriotic and business like action.",27
192,Mr SAMPSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,It enabled the publio works of the country to be carried on through State instrumentalities.,27
193,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The honourable member for Angas spoke of the difference between the amount of gold held against a note issue of £25,000,000 and that held against a note issue of £27,000,000. Mir. GLYNN - There is an increasing disproportion between the note issue and the gold reserve.",27
194,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Because , as I have told Parliament, we have not taken from the banks their last two monthly instalments.",27
195,Mr GLYNN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,I know that.,27
196,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Y e t the honourable member has made a statement which, if uncontradicted, would create a false impression.",28
197,Mr GLYNN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I said that you'will borrow £7,000,000 more from the banks, and that you have to make your payments in notes to keep your services going.",28
198,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"T w o instalments are due by the banks, but I have not taken them, because I have not needed the money, and I do not think it should lie idle if it can be used. We have had more consideration for the private banks than the honourable member would have.",28
199,Mr GLYNN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"When the war is over, the Government will have to pay £10,000,000 to the banks. I wish to know how it is proposed to contract the volume of the note issue then ?",28
200,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,On e of the honourable member's questions was how will the gold reserve be maintained. I am maintaining it by not demanding more than is absolutely necessary for the safety of the note issue.,28
201,Mr GLYNN,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,The note issue is safe enough.,28
202,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Then what is the trouble? The suggestion was made that we should reduce the gold reserve to 25 per cent., but I have never supported such a reduction. We have said definitely and distinctly that the statutory reserve should not be less tlian 25 per cent, at any time, but with such a statutory reserve it would be impossible to reduce the proportion of gold held to 25 per cent. I have always advocated 33 per cent, as a sound working margin, but at the present time it is from 35 to 38 per cent. The banks have agreed to hold certain notes for their own purposes, and not to present them, an undertaking which I believe they are honourably carrying out.",28
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,They will present them when the war is over.,28
204,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I shall come to that point, and, if the Opposition thinks necessary, I shall be glad to afford opportunity for the full discussion of the financial position. To discuss a side issue might disturb the public mind, because the full facts might not be put before the public. As to the £10,000,000 lent by the banks, to be repaid at the end of the war, I do not think that there should be the slightest difficulty in wiping off the debt, or in coming to some satisfactory arrange[89] ment regarding it . There is no reason to fear that the Commonwealth credit will not be as good then as it is now, unless, of course, our enemies are the victors, in which case nothing will much matter, though we shall have the satisfaction of having done our best. We have lent £18,000,000 to the Governments of the States, which they are to repay at the end of the war. The British Government has lent us the same amount for an indefinite period, which may be from eight to fourteen years. What we are to get returned from the States will be a great help.",28
205,Mr SAMPSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,Is that to be utilized for the purpose of repaying the banks and reducing the note issue ?,28
206,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"A man in my position would be a fool to say so far ahead what he is going to do with any particular amount of money, because no living man can tell at this time what he will be required to do at some future date, any more than can any honourable member know what will be the position of the money market a year hence.",28
207,Mr SAMPSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,I am referring to the repayments by the States.,28
208,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The amounts lent to the States are due to be repaid two years from the time the loans were entered into. Whenever the war ends, the settlement will not be much earlier than the date I have indicated. The £18,000,000 which the Mother Country has loaned to us is not due to be repaid at that time; therefore, that amount will be available, and I have the best of reasons for saying that the bankers themselves will be quiteanxious to make conditions regarding the£10,000,000 they have lent to the Government. There is a false impression that the gold reserve in Australia is being depleted; as a matter of fact, it is in creasing. If we continue as we are doing at present, there will be no embarrassment of any kind when the war ends",28
209,Mr SAMPSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,What I desire to know is whether the money to be repaid by the States to the Commonwealth is to be used to reduce the note issue and for the repayment of the amount borrowed from the banks?,28
210,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"In my opinion, it would be the duty of any Government at the end of the war to reduce the note issue to normal.",28
211,Mr SAMPSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,But is the money to be repaid by the States to be devoted to that purpose ?,28
212,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I have already said that a man would be a born fool who would earmark any money for a particular purpose, because the credit of the whole Commonwealth, which is much more important than the £10,000,000, will be available.",29
213,Mr SAMPSON,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,Then what is to done with the money returned by the States!,29
214,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I shall leave that matter to the future. That money will be paid ' into Consolidated Revenue, and dealt with as. may be decided by the persons appointed by the people to carry on the business of the country. If anything to do with the matter, the agreement entered into wit'h the banks will be strictly carried out, and th© note issue will be reduced to its normal proportions as soon as possible after the war is over. That matter can soon be adjusted at the end of hostilities. I can again tell the Committee that the Government are in favour'of a convertible note issue. are in favour of a safe gold margin to be held against the notes. Nobody is compelled to take those notes, although the banks have entered into arrangements in certain cases to hold the notes during this period of crisis. I desire to say again that if this matter is to be raised piecemeal, I would much prefer that it should be dealt with on a separate motion so that it may be discussed in detail, and so prevent any persons, who may wish to do so, damaging the credit of the country by saying that there is danger. is no danger, nor is there likely to be any, so long as we have a convertible note issue. I believe it will be possible to increase the note issue to £40,000,000 without the slightest danger or difficulty, and in saying that I am uttering not only my own opinion, but the opinions of some of the best-informed and most patriotic authorities in Australia.",29
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"Parramatta) [3.5] - I did not hear the early part of this discussion, but I heard the latter remarks of the right honourable gentleman, and I hope that he does not include me in the category of enemies of the credit of the country. I am certain that my colleague who has raised this matter is also entirely out of that category. May I suggest that in discussing these matters it would be infinitely better if the right honourable gentleman would cease raising the cry of "" wolf "" every time reference is made to a financial matter. Somehow the right honourable gentleman seems obsessed with the idea that anybody who asks a question about the finances or the Commonwealth Bank is sum of an enemy to the credit of the country. That sort of fustian should cease. be Mr FISHER - You did very well yesterday. Do not spoil your record now.",29
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"If I am spoiling my record, it is because the right honourable gentleman has set me an example. He should give others as well as himself credit for wishing to conserve I have the credit of the country. He should be the last to complain about anybody on this side of the Chamber wishing to do anything to damage the credit of Australia. As I understand the issue which has been raised, the honourable member for Angas makes a clear distinction between the note issue and the solvency of the general finances. He has made it clear beyond We possibility of cavil that the credit of the country is unassailable; but that is not the point. The question he raised is pertinent, and will have to be met some time or other, although, personally, I should not have raised it at this stage. The position is that very shortly the note issue will have reached £25,000,000 or £50,000,000.",29
217,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,I hope not.,29
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"I do not see how the right honourable member is going to escape that result. He will have to go There far beyond the £40,000,000 at the rate he is travelling at the present time. Let us suppose that the note issue shortly reaches £40,000,000. Immediately the war is over the right honourable gentleman will be under his first obligation to reduce the volume of notes, and, therefore, the volume of the gold reserve. And , as he has only £4,000,000 of gold, which was in the reserve originally, plus the £10,000,000 which he has received from the banks- a total of £14,000,000 to set against the £40,000,000 worth of noteshe must realise that he will require to make some tremendous adjustments of the finances the moment the war period is over. We have a right to ask what is in the right honourable gentleman's mind, considering that he makes these arrangements with the banks of so temporary a character. I could understand it , and we should be much easier in our minds, if he had made an agreement with the banks that the arrangement was to continue after the war until he had had a reasonable opportunity of setting matters right.",29
219,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,The arrangement is until after the war is over.,30
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"But immediately the war ceases the Treasurer is under this obligation to the banks, and where he is to get the money from to repay them is a problem. another fact .to be considered.: The total volume of the notes issued at the commencement of the war was about £10,000,000 or £11,000,000, of which about half was in actual circulation. The balance was in the coffers of the banks. Therefore, if there was that actual circulation of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 in ordinary circumstances, the right honourable gentleman, in order to meet the. present extraordinary circumstances, will require to extend the issue to £45,000,000 or £50,000,000. ' » Mr FISBEB - It is £27,000,000 at present time.",30
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The honourable member admits the likelihood of the reaching £40,000,000, and I think that, by the time he has met his obligations the States and the expenditure on the war, and has financed the Government requirements during the next twelve found months, he will have raised the issue into crucial days. the region of £45,000,000.",30
222,Mr FISHER,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,We receive as much matter 1 monthly as we give to the States.,30
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POSITION SUNDERNAVIGATION,"The Commonof wealth receives as much credit as it gives, but it does not receive gold.",30

Personally, I should not have raised this cussion, except to utter a word of caution, as I think we are entitled to do.

We cannot carry an unlimited note issue. All those nonsensical theories on the subject that used to be enunciated [89]- a so warmly have been thrown overboard. The hard facts of actual experience have knocked a l ot of that nonsense out of our heads, and I congratulate the right honourable gentleman on the way he replied a few days ago to a union, the members of which thought that he had nothing to do but to turn the printing machine and keep the whole of the unemployed throughout There is the length and breadth of the country in full employment. I know that honourable members on the Government side are in a little trouble, over this matter. They have gone over the whole country continuously and persistently telling the people that unemployment could be made to cease if only Labour were at the helm and in charge of all the country's resources; but now that this time of national stress has come, they find that all their Labour propaganda on the unemployment question has failed them miserably.",30
