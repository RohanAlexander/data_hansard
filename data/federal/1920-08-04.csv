I wish to stress the .point that, least, three months - have elapsed since invited the representatives of organized Labour and of organized Capital to meet in conference to discuss 'the best means settling industrial strife and promoting Eid-trstrial peace. 'One important Labour organization the Melbourne Trades Hall rejected the invitation, and neitherparty has evinced any particulai anxiety to give effect to it. This Legisbunals lature, however, is charged with a duty which it may not evade merely because parties outside evade their duty. Organized Labour could not hold a conference for, I think, at the very least six weeks.",19
5,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Thre e weeks.,19
6,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"A conference meeting within three weeks would not be an body; it would have no authority. To confer the necessary authority all the bodies that were to be represented must first meet, and discuss the matter, before their representatives could be definitely instructed what to do - An uninstructed conference would have to refer its conclusions to, the respective of which it was representative, to be considered by them in their turn, and thus at least three months would elapse before we could know Labour's attitude towards the measure. There would be the same delay if a special conference reof Capital were called to consider the Bill. Curiously enough, this very day I have had a request for delay of from representatives of both sections of",19

8,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Yes: ; and another to honourable gentleman has informed me that the Chambers of Manufactures tb* country are greatly perturbed about the Bill. This intimation that both parties desire the deferring of its consideration, because each thinks it against their interests, is the best evidence that they are mistaken. Parliaof ment must proceed with the measure. A conference will be called, and will meet as soon as the paTties are ready; that it did not meet long ago is not the fault of the Government. At this conference both parties must be represented if opinions of any value to Parliament are to result. at .Should the conference approve of the I measure, and suggest amendments, they wall be made law; but :'in the meantime the Bill musttoe.passed.

In view of the fact that sum is considered to be an al« together paltry amount, compared with what was expected, and that there is some misunderstanding,"" I wish to know if the Prime Minister has any further information to supply to the House and to the",20
17,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I noticed the cablegram to which the honourable member has referred, and that the amount mentioned f was £6,483,901. I understood, however, that that that represented Australia's halfshare of profits up to March, 1919. The honourable member has referred to that amount as Perhaps he appreciate what the position was during that year, and prior to I March, 1919. To the date of the armistice the amount of wool sold for civilian purposes-that is, the amount upon which we were entitled to half-profits-was'mos t inconsiderable; indeed, it was negligible. It was only after 11th November, 1918, and not until some months after, that the demand fo' wool for military purposes began to fail off and the demand for wool for civilian requirements began to inrapdily. Up till March, 1919, therefore, there was very little by way of The amount due to Marob of was, I think, about £1,900,000; while up to March of 1919 it had reached-accordin g to the British MinisI can add of nothing further to the statement made the British Minister, whose name, for the letter the moment, \ have forgotten. ",20
18,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Well , I think that is a very app' apriate name, for that is all the Australian wool-grower is living on just now, so far as ou> half profits are concerned. I distinctly hope we shall be able to announce, without further delay, that this sum has heen made available. As for making a more complete statement upon this subject, I can only add that I saw the members of the Australian Wool Council on Friday last, and supplied them with the latest information. This, I might state, did not coincide - with the figure mentioned in the press cablegram. The amount quoted in a telegram received by me from the British Chancellor of the Exchequer was in excess of that amount - no t very considerably, but still it was larger.' The telegram involved other matters, but I asked that the money should be paid without delay. I asked, further, that it should be paid through the Central Wool Committee, so that it could be distributed. There is no other agency by which it can be distributed. - Honourable members will appreciate that the half-profits are not paid at large, but on specific parcels, or bales, of wool; therefore, the Wool Committee is the proper party to distribute the money, and I have asked that the amount shall be made available to that body for that purpose. WAR GRATUITY BONDS.",20
19,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do not know whether the attention of the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) has been called to an item of news in the Melbourne Herald of Tuesday, to ' the effect that an unfortunate returned soldier, aged forty, had committed suicide. It was shown in evidence at a coronial inquiry that the deceased ex-soldier had possessed a war gratuity bond valued at £95, which was realized on at Ludbrook's stores. This firm, it appears, got the deceased to purchase £48 worth of goods, and gave him the balance in cash. In view of a comment by the coroner, that it would be interesting to know what the deceased got in his £48 worth of goods at Ludbrook's stores, I ask if the Minister will make some inquiry so that cases where suspicion has been raised may be cleared up.",21
20,Sir XJRANVILLE RYRIE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes , I shall have inquiries made in the matter. NA EXPERIMENTS . DrMALONEY asked the Minister for Works and Railways, upon notice I. When does the Government assistance for the rain experiments of Mr Balsillie terminate? 2. Will the Minister inform the House if any tangible benefits have been obtained for the £5,273 already expended?",21
21,Mr WI SE,RAIN STIMULATIO N," The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It will largely depend upon the results obtained. 2. As already intimated in reply to questions in Parliament, the operation of a rainfall stimulation station in every instance apparently coincided with a more than average amount of rainfall in that district for the period of working. Increased rainfall is of such vital importance to Australia generally that it was considered a benefit to the immense pastoral, agricultural, and various other interests involved to in any way advance our knowledge on such a very important subject as rainfall stimulation, on the success of which added production would follow. WOOL POOL. ' NEGOTIATIONS IN LONDON-WOO L Tors CONTRACT. ' Mr CUNNINGHAM asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the Government intend to appoint a representative of the Commonwealth in Great Britain to fulfil the duties that were to be undertaken by Mr Watt in regard to the clearing up of the ""'Wool Pool"" accounts? 2.

26,Mr HUGHES,RAIN STIMULATIO N,"I would invite the honourable member's attention to the provision set out in the second schedule to the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act 1920 in regard to this matter:The Commission may grant a pension not exceeding the special rate of pension (£8 per fortnight) to any member of the Forces who is suffering from tuberculosis, and who has been for at least six months an inmate of un establishment for persons so suffering, and has been discharged from that establishment: Provided that this paragraph shall not authorize the grant of a pension to such member of the Forces unless upon his discharge from the establishment the medical officer in charge of that establishment has certified that such discharge is not a menace to public health. DEPORTATION S.",22
27,Mr BRENNAN,RAIN STIMULATIO N,"the Prime M in ister, upon notice I. Are there any persons in Australia whom the Government has already decided to deport? 2. If so, how many, and what are their names and addresses?",22
28,Mr HUGHES,RAIN STIMULATIO N,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Ihore are no such persons other than nationals of enemy or late 'enemy countries who were interned during the war. 2. It is not proposed to make public such particulars in regard to the cases mentioned.,22
29,Mr BRENNAN,RAIN STIMULATIO N,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice- „ What is the elause and page in the PeaceTreaty to which the Minister referred in the Senate on the 21st July instant, on the subject of deportations, when he said, "" The Peace Treaty provides for such deportations "" ? - Sir GRANVILLERYRIE - The honourable member's attention is directed to the statement made by the Minister for Defence in his speech in the.Senate on the 21st July, which was as follows:If honourable senators will turn to the Peace Treaty, signed at Versailles, they will find in Articles 214 and 220 of Part VI . that Germany has agreed to the deportation of enemy nationals, and is prepared to take the necessary steps to receive them when they arc expelled from other countries. COMMONWEALTH STEAMERS. ' Mr CUNNINGHAM asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the Prime Minister will bring under the notice of the British authorities the action of the Shipping Combine, which threatens to hold up shipping required to export Australian primary products to the overseas markets of Great Britain? 2. Will he represent to the British authorities, in view of the enormous debt being carried by the people of Australia owing to its participation in the war, the urgent necessity for the British Government taking steps to prevent a boycott of Commonwealth steamers, which, notwithstanding the Prime Minister's announcement to "" fight to the bitter end,"" threatens to hold up shipping to and from Australia?",22

32,Mr HUGHES,RAIN STIMULATIO N,"As I receive from 50 to 100 or more letters per day, I shall be glad if the honourable member will indicate the subject-matter of the communication referred to, and by whom it was written, in order that I may be able to' furnish him with a reply to his question.

34,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVICE,"As both clerks and telegraphists are included in the Clerical Division, I shall be glad if the honourable member will indicate whether he has in mind.an examination for clerk or for telegraphist, and the State in regard to which he desires the information, when I will furnish him with a reply. STANDING ORDERS REVISION .",22
35,Dr MALONEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"the Prime M in ister, upon noticeIn view of the fact that the Standing Orders of th-i House of Representatives are only ""temporarily adopted,"" and have continued in the same temporary condition for about nineteen years, will the Government appoint a Committee to bring the rules of debate up to date, specially with reference to the shortening of speeches on private members' day?",22
36,Mr HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The proper Ooininittee to deal with the Standing Orders is the Standing Orders Committee. In the sessions 3901-02, 1903, and 1905, the Standing Orders were very carefully revised by the Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Speaker Holder, and, as amended by it, were recommended to the House. Pressure of other business has hitherto prevented the consideration by the House of the Standing Orders as submitted by the Committee. The following papers were presented:Defence Act-Regulation s Amended-Statu tory Rules 1920, Nos. I l l , 123. Electoral Act and Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act-Regulation s AmendedStatutory Rules 1920, No. 126. Public Service Act-Appointmen t of E. J. Dowling, Home and Territories Department. Shale Oil Bounty Act-Retur n for 1919-20. DISSENT FROM MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER'S RULING.",23
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE," Before calling on the motion standing in the name of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr. Nicholls), I think it only proper that I should place the facts of ihe matter beuntil fore the House. The motion, as proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) Friday, wasThat on each sitting day, unless otherwise ordered, Government business shall take precedence of general business. The honourable member for Macquarie then moved an amendment as follows:That all the words after "" That"" be left out with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the lowing:On each day save one, unless otherwise ordered, Government business shall take precedence of general business, and that there shall be an additional sitting day on Tuesday of each week. The amendment haying been seconded, I ruled it out of order on the ground that it was not relevant to the motion (standing order 130), the main purpose of which was to give Government business precedence over general business on each or every day of sitting, irrespective of the number of sittings, which was not. mentioned in the motion. The words "" save one "" were not relevant to the motion, being a direct negative, and a negativing of the motion would have had the same effect as if the amendment had been approved. The proposal to increase the number of sitting days, incorporated, as it was, with the proviso that one day should be saved - for general business, would, in effect, have defeated the main principle of the motion, namely, that of securing priority for Government business over general business, irrespective of the number of sittings. Any proposal to increase the number of sittings should form the subject of a separate motion. It is the usual practice for the Government PAPERS. only to propose such a motion; but, of course, I do not suggest that it would be incompetent or out of order for any private member to do so upon motion after notice. My interpretation of the standing order was, and is, that the words ""save one"" were not relative to the motion, being a direct negative of it, and the proposal to add other words increasing the number of sittings was not in order, because the motion made no reference to the number of sittings. Upon a question analagous to this, there has been a decision by Mr Speaker Holder. In Vol. VII . of Hansard of the 1901-2 session, it is recorded that a motion had been submittedThat the House, at its rising today, adjourn Tuesday next. on In the course of a long discussionMr SYDNEY SMITH said-We shall have another opportunity to discuss it, because the House has already carried a motion making Monday a sitting day. Mr ""SPEAKER - The general - question of 1 sitting on Monday is not before the Chair. The question is whether we shall sit next Monday.",23
38,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Would it be in order for me to move, as an amendment, that .the folHouse meet at half-past ten a.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays?",23
39,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No . The motion now before the Chair is, in effect, that the House do not sit on Monday next, and I'cannot allow the honourable member to discuss the question of sitting on Mondays generally.",23
40,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Would it not be competent for the honourable member to move, as an amendment, that, after next Monday, we do not sit on Mondays at all? It will not be necessary for the Government to move in the matter to insure further Monday sittings, because of the motion which we have already passed, and no private member will have an opportunity to raise the question.",23
41,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Such an amendment as the honourable member suggests could not be moved. The only amendment permissible on the motion before the Chair would be amendment fixing Tuesday or some other day as the next day of meeting, or altering the hour of meeting. The only amendment that I can accept is an amendment relating to next sitting day. Standing order No. 41 vides that a motion for fixing the next day of meeting may be moved at any time, without notice, by a Minister of the Crown; is nothing to prevent any other member of the House from moving a similar motion upon House notice.",24
42,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Bu the could never reach,24
43,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is not a matter which I am called upon to consider. Upon leave the motion now before the Chair I cannot allow more than an incidental reference to anything beyond the next day of sitting. Further debate took place, and Mr Watson, who was member for Bland,, put this suggestion, which is practically same as that made in the case we are dealing with I desire to ask you, Mr Speaker, whether it will be in order to move an amendment, adding to the motion the following words:"" And shall thereafter, until otherwise ordered, meet on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and FridayB only."" I would that standing order No. 41 does not preclude the possibility of an amendment being moved. decision. My sole desire is to have the matter discussed in. an orderly way, and there is no suggestion of want of confidence in the Govern The ment, or any desire to take the business out of their hands. Mr Barton, who was then Prime M in ister, saidOn the point of order, might I suggest that as followsthis is a motion for a special adjournment, and that the sole question before the Chair is as to what shall be our next sitting Therefore, any mention of the other sitting days would be irrelevant to the motion. This is the ruling of Mr Speaker Holder I am prepared to give a ruling at once.; and I desire to give it forthwith, because it is practically a repetition of the ruling already given. Standing order No. 41 does not preclude the moving of an amendment. quoted standing order No. 41 in connection with quite another point; but the whole tice of Parliament is entirely against permitity ting any such amendment as that suggested by the honourable member for Bland. Further, the amendment is irrelevant to the question at issue, which is whether the next sitting day shall be Tuesday. I would suggest honourable 'members that, if it is the desire ascertain the will of the House upon the ral question of sitting days, there is a easy way of doing so. If the Government discern that it is the will of the House that opportunity should be given for discussing the you. question of sitting days generally, they can easily afford that opportunity next week, on an honourable member bringing forward a moan tion specially dealing with the matter. I find, on reference to the practice of the British House of Commons, quite a numthe ber of decisions in conformity with the proruling I gave. I now quote from Peel's Decisions, 1884-95, page 8,- on the relebut there vancy of amendmentsAn amendment to a question before the must be relevant thereto. In this case, on a motion "" That the House at its rising do it. adjourn until Thursday next"" (Derby Day adjournment), an amendment was moved to out all the words after "" That,"" in order to add, "" tomorrow Government business have precedence over all other Orders of the Day."" Mr Speaker ruled that the amendment . J . C. was out of order as irrelevant. There are other decisions in regard to the amendments which are a negation of the motion itself, and another decision, on page 10, of Denison & Brand's Decisions, 1857-84, dealing with relevancy. I might quote quite a number of other decisions, but I have given the House the information at mv disposal as to Mr Speaker urge Holder's ruling, and I now leave the matter to honourable members for their",24
44,Mr NICHOLLS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Macquarie) |""3.35l decisions quoted by you, sir, may come from very reliable authorities on standing orders; I take it for granted - that they do, but I draw your attention to our standing order No. 128, which is A question having been proposed may 'be day? amended (i) by leaving out certain words only; (ii) by leaving out certain words, in order to insert or add other words; (iii) by inserting or adding words.

54,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No ; because the Government has a lob of subservient followers, men who feed cut of the hand of the Prime Minister, and say, "" Yes, Mr . Hughes.""",26
55,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member says "" Yes , "" to certain persons outside.",26
56,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have consulted those people outside who are vitally interested in this measure. There can be no industrial peace unless the industrial organizations support our legislation. A Bill taking from them rights that they have at present ought not to be rushed through interject- before they have had an opportunity of considering it . Some of the honourable members opposite have belonged to the Labour movement, and they know that the Labour organizations do not meet more frequently than once a week. Probably a number of them will meet tomorrow, or on Friday, but they cannot discuss the Bill then. Some of the members of the Corner party said when the Prime Minister was introducing the Bill that it was to do away with the Arbitration Court. No doubt those honourable members who are well circumstanced do not care how the rank and file have to struggle, at a time when £ 3 per week is not worth as much as £ 2 was worth five - I do or six years ago. The toilers will find that what they have won is being taken from them. Yet you ask them to support the Bill blindly. The present Arbitration Act is based on organizations, and there is not an honourable member on this side who would not fail in his duty if he did not protest against this haste to abolish it before the workers, who produce the wealth of the world, have had an opportunity of considering the question.  mary producer consulted before legislation is passed?",26
57,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member can speak for the primary producer. I do not represent a constituency of primary producers,- though when I have held M in isterial office I have always been ready to' consult them. This measure is not concerned with primary producers.",27
58,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes , it is.",27
59,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Not as much as with the great body, of workers who are employed in other places than in the country- We were told, by ' the Prime Minister in his second-reading speech that it dealt with organized Labour - I shall quote his exact words when I come to speak on the second-reading motion. On the present motion I have ten minutes only, though fortunately I cannot) be cut short by the closure. I protest in the interests of the workers against the rushing through of the Bill before they have had an opportunit y to consider it . It rally admitted that without "" the heartv co-operation of both parties the measure must be a failure. If honourable members opposite do not vote in accordance with party ties, the Prime Minister cannot carry this motion. Under the circumstances the people who will be directly affected by the measure will have no opportunity to consider it as full y as they should if it is to be successful.",27
60,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Dalley) I direct the attention of the Government to the seriousness of the situation which is now developing. I hold the maintenance of industrial peace dear to my heart, and I am prepared to go a long way to secure its maintenance. One thing which is essential to the establishment of industrial peace is that the good-will of the workers shall be gained. If the unionists in Australia's industries are given cause to look upon this piece of legislation with suspicious eyes the Government will fai l to achieve their object. I know what is about to happen in this House. Unfortunately, partyism is going to force honourable members' hands; it is going tostifle full and proper discussion.",27
61,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Is the honourable member prepared to discuss the Bill tomorrow ? Mr MAHONY . - I am prepared to discuss it now. I am out for the achievement of industrial peace throughout Australia;- and the Government should know that the first step towards bringing that about would be by giving honourable mebers sufficient time to discuss this measure, and by permitting a long enough period to elapse for the great trade organizations outside to discuss the principles of the Bill and furnish their suggestions either direct to the Prime Minister or to honourable members on this side, who represent the Labour organizations of Australia. If such a course is prevented, however, the Government will be left in no doubt as to what is bound to happen. If full and fair opportunity is not given to the organizations and their representatives in this Parliament .to express their considered views upon the Bill , then, if the Government want to k ill the Bill , they can do it in noway more effectively than by proceeding as they now propose. I represent - one of the largest industrial constituencies in Australia. , 1I have been in conversation and consultation with prois gene- minent members of trade organizations; and, above all, they have asked me to endeavour to secure sufficient time to permit their members to consider this Bill . I want to be frank and fair. These representative men were not bitterly hostile to the Bill , and to the principles which it enunciates, merely because it has emanated from the Prime Minister. They were prepared, if given an opportunity, to adequately consider and discuss it , to [ 4 . 5 ] - give Parliament the benefit of their views. This assistance, I feel convinced, would have been of great benefit in the direction of bringing about and maintaining industrial peace. But the procedure now - launched by the Government can only create suspicion and distrust. The Government have caused me to doubt their bona fides. Their actions make me believe that there is a trap set- a p it f a ll somewhere-to catch the great trade organizaions; and when I am suspicious of the actions of the Government it is a reflexion of the suspicions created in the minds of the leaders of the bulk of trade unions throughout the Commonwealth. The Government, of course, can pass any piece of legislation they choose to introduce. They may use their numbers to bludgeon through as many Bills as they desire in order to hamper and tie down the trade unions movement. must not forget that the organizations will maintain and increase their strength. They will protect their own dignity and their own rights. If , however, the Government are prepared to meet the unions fair l y and honourably, and to endeavour, with them and their representatives, to bring about peace by way of an honest legislative effort, then now is the opportunity. But the Government must give honourable members and the organizations outside full opportunity to consider and discuss their proposition.",27
62,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Dampier 1 T4.10] The Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Tudor) was quite incorrect in his assumption that honourable members on this side were not aware that this Bill was to be treated as an urgent measure. Honourable members were consulted, and the only point we had to consider was whether the time specified in the Prime Minister's motion would provide ample opportunity for the discussion of a small measure of this nature.",28
63,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"A small measure, but important.",28
64,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It is small, but is a most important Bill . However, in this Chamber there are more than twenty direct representatives of Labour, all of whom are quite prepared, and ,well equipped, to see that the interests of the workers of Australia are properly safeguarded. Those honourable members must be well aware, also, that for the past few years there have been great efforts to 'bring about some means of guaranteeing industrial peace. I may say that I , myself, am not committed to this Bill , and that I may be found voting with honourable members opposite upon some of its features.",28
65,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"But , with defects, you want it quickly.",28
66,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,Does not the honourable member think that t ill Thursday of next week ample time will have been provided ? Does the honourable member want to go around the country consulting all his trade union people before venturing to express his own views in this Chamber ?,28
67,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am quite prepared to go on now, and to criticise the Bill , but I want time to be allowed before it is passed. But they Mr GREGORY - There is to be ample time provided. I realise that the Bill is one that should not be delayed. We must have some system in order to try to bring about industrial peace. To my mind, honourable members opposite should feel quite satisfied that the time allotted for the consideration of a small measure such as this is sufficient.",28
68,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Darling ) [4.13] This may be a small measure, but it will probably prove to be the most important passed 'during this session. I do not know of any other foreshadowed, or likely to be introduced, which will be so far-reaching as this Bill , which is intended practically to control the whole of the industries of Australia. It is of no use for any body to imagine that the Arbitration Court will remain in existence after this Bill has been passed. There will be no such thing as'the Arbitration Court. No Judge in Australia will be prepared to give an award whioh will be liable to be superseded by an award made on the day following by a body which-by the waywill not be representative of the trade organizations. These tribunals will be a. motley collection, got together. by the Prime Minister himself. The Bill does not provide for the representation of trade union organizations. If there is a "" scab "" organization^ if there is a small body of men acting in conjunction with the employers, it will be called upon to appoint its representatives on the tribunal. But bond fide organizations will find themselves outside. One thing which may be said in favour of the Arbitration Act , at any rate, is that it provides for the bond fide trade imion organizations. If this Bill is passed the safeguards contained in our arbitration legislation will have completely disappeared. The organizations will find themselves in the hands of the Prime all its Minister. The Government are about to k i ll the Arbitration Court. It will not be killed by its own defects, but by the Government who, after all, are out not so much to k ill the Act itself as to settle the man behind it ; I refer to Mr Justice Higgins. I warn the Government that unless they have the trade unionists behind them, in agreement upon this measure, it will never work. The Government may pass legislation-coerciv e or otherwise. They may pass Bills by the hundred, but such actions will get them nowhere. If this Bill is hurried through Parliament, without full and fair opportunity for discussion., i will be wrecked by the weight of opposition outside. There are twenty-six honourable members in this Chamber directly representative of the great organizations of Australia. All could find,,in the Bill , subject sufficient for them to address the House for at least an hour each, and in that time each honourable member could f u r nish helpful suggestions. But the time to be allowed will not be sufficient to permit of re-drafting in any effective sr-nse. The outcome of this measure will be that four distinct and separate bodies will be able to deal with a dispute. That, on the face of it , - must create confusion. it now stands, the Bill indicates a desire to hurriedly create something which will bring about the end of the Federal A r b i tration Court and substitute something else which will .be under the control of the Prime Minister. The Arbitration Act, and the Court behind the Act, are to be killed, not because of their defects or demerits, but as an outcome of the Government having allowed as many as forty-two organizations to go before the Court, so congesting and choking it that it is bounid to succumb to the very weight of work heaped upon it . If the Government will not provide a. sumcient number of Judges to do the work awaiting the Arbitration Court, what is there by way of guarantee that they will not also p slow in the (matter of appointing their chairmen to the various tribunals under this Bill ? I repeat that unless the Government are prepared to fairly meet t ' trade unionists of Australia, and to give them an opportunity to forward suggestions, and then; to consider and accept those suggestions, the era of direct action will haye commenced from the date of the passing of this Bill .  member represent those trade unionists ?",28
69,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have deavoured to do so. I am the president of an organization numbering some 112,000 members.. We have been associated with the Arbitration. Court since its inception in 1907. We have done all in< our power to make that Court a workable institution.' Now our members are taking a vital vote-it will be conducted after the passage of this Bill-and I personally will be unable to recommend to them the method of conciliation and arbitration set for t h in tae Bill , unless it is considerably amended. The Australian Workers Union may decide this L year that they will have nothing more to do with arbitration. They will not accept the principles laid down in this measure. Thus, in one swoop, the Government will have practically compelled matter more than 112,000 trade unionists to resort to direct action. The coal miners, in their many thousands, have already practically decided upon that course. Then there are the waterside workers, numbering about 15,000. There is a danger that the large organizations may decide that they will have nothing to do with arbitration and conAs ciliation as at present in force, or with this peculiar and cumbersome subterfuge to get r i d of Mr Justice Higgins. If the Government are willing to take the responsibility of passing this Bill in a comparatively few hours, they must accept responsibility also for bringing about direct action in this country. In portions of New South Wales members of my organization are compelled, by the defects of the arbitration laws of this country, to take direct action today, and they will win a forty-four hour week. The Prime Minister and the members of the National and Country parties should pause before they impose a time l i m it to this Bill , which will prevent the representatives of industrial organizations discussing the proposals in all their bearings. Unless the workers, who have to live and work under the proposed legislation, are given an opportunity to consider it they will refuse to have anything to do with it . Then the position will be that the Arbitration Court will have been set aside, and the Government will have this extraordinary Bill , which could emanate only from the mind of such a man as the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), left on their hands, and nobody taking any notice of it . The Government should not attempt to pass en- this piece of legislation so quickly. If they insist on treating it as a matter of urgency, those who support them must accept responsibility for the consequences.",29
70,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"ParramattaTreasurer) [4.22] - The honourable member for Darling began by condemning the Bill , lock, stock, and barrel. He said it is a trap, a trick, and a conspiracy against unionism. He said that we are proposing to bludgeon through the House a measure that will produce dire consequences to the country. Listening to him,' one would imagine that the Government were a set of fools who were trying to light a fire that will lead to disaster in this country.",29
71,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,I believe that the Government are doing that. Sir JOSEP HCOOK . ^ What rubbish all this talk is! I remind the honourable member that only last week the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) declared that the question of industrial legislation was so urgent that it could not be delayed a day.  not say that the legislation should be before the House for only a day.,30
72,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Fro m the time of its introduction, t ill it is disposed of under the motion of urgency, the Bill will have been before this House for fifteen days. Is it of any use to refer this Bill to any outside body when all honourable members opposite who have spoken have already made up their minds that it is no good ?",30
73,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVICE,I did not say that.,30
74,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,Not all of us made that statement. I have never said that the Bill was no good.,30
75,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There is before us a fortnight , the whole of which will be devoted to the consideration of this measure.",30
76,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,There is not a fortnight.,30
77,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"All this week and the following week can be devoted entirely to the consideration of this measure. If the unions were so feverish and anxious last week that this legislation could not be delayed a day, do honourable members mean to tell me that the outside organizations do not already know all that the Bill contains ? It has been published in the newspapers, from end to end of the continent, and the unions can easily send along their approval or objection to their representatives within the next fortnight. Honourable members opposite are protesting too much.",30
78,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVICE,Would it h u r t the Government to allow the Bill to wait another week ?,30
79,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I suggest that nothing can be gained by postponing this matter for a week. If honourable members will settle down to discuss the measure seriously and properly, and at the end of the fortnigh t it is found that the proposal in its present form is likely to prove abortive, the Government must take notice of such a state of affairs. I am now contesting the statement that the Government are attempting to bludgeon this Bill through the House for a sinister purpose. Here is a bond fide attempt to meet a new order of industrialism in this country, and the sooner honourable members opposite, with - all their experience and ability, bend themselves to the task, the better for all concerned. Such an effort on their part will do infinitely more good to the unions outside than all the he did empty talk to which we have just listened.",30
80,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Hunter) [4.28] The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) said that honourable members on this side must regard the Government as a set of fools. I tell him that if the Government desire * to establish industrial peace, which is essential to the welfare of the country, they will have to go about this business in a different manner. B y using the Standing Orders to l i m it the debate upon this measure they are not consulting the best interests of Australia. I do not say that if the Government treated this Bill in the ordinary way it would not be disposed of at the end of next week. But by this very motion of urgency, the Government will, create an adverse feeling in union circles. Industrialists have no fixed opinion yet in regard to this measure; they are desirous of giving it a fair chance if they can agree to the principle it embodies. The Bill contains a new set of principles in regard to indust r i a l arbitration, and involves a complete change from any system of which we have had any experience in the past. It is essential, therefore, that the people who are vitally concerned in the measure, and whom we desire to settle their disputes according to the principles adopted by Parliament, should have the fullest. opportunity to consider the effects of"" the Bill. Unionists have no time for the ""gag,"" and when they read in the press that the Government are applying the "" gag "" in regard. to this measure, that will be the end of the Bill so far as they are concerned.",30
81,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There is no "" gag "" in this motion.",30
82,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It is contended that this Bill is urgent, owing to the congestion of work in the Arbitration Court. Is it not strange that although the House has been sitting for two or three months the Government made no effort to introduce the Bill earlier? Other measures which were not of such importance to the community-the Bureau of Science and Industry Bill, for instance, a measure that will not affect the industrial workers to any great extent-were given full discussion, whilst upon the discussion of this important Bill the Government immediately impose a time limit. the present moment industrial organizations are studying the contents and likely effects of the Bill ; they have received copies of it only this week. Their members must be called together in order to obtain an opinion upon the proposal. Admittedly in regard to the machinery of the Bill there is a difference of opinion, and if the Government allow sufficient time for the proposals to be digested by the people whom they most closely concern, some support for them might be forthcoming. The time has arrived when any Government before drafting industrial legislation should sult those most directly concerned in it. We cannot keep in touch with the industrial movement as those engaged in it and both employers and employees should be given an opportunity to express their views in regard to any proposed remedial arbitration legislation.",31
83,Mr MCDONALD,PUBLIC SERVICE,Such consultations have taken place in many cases.,31
84,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes , but in regard to this most important Bill no such opportunity is to be given. It is possible that had the urgency motion not been proposed by the Government the Bill might have been disposed of by this day next week. But as the Government have decided to "" gag"" the Bill through the House the influence of the trade unions outside will be brought to bear on Labour members in the House, and probably the discussion will be prolonged. The second reading must be carried by a certain day, and time limits are fixed for other stages of the Bill. Some honourable members may have vital amendments to submitproposals which, if they could be explained to the Committee, might be accepted to the betterment of the Bill. But the whole of the time allotted to the Committee stage may be used in the consideration of prior amendments of lesser importance, and those members who wish to put forward later amendments which would improve the Bill and make it acceptable to the big industrial unions, will be shut out by the operation of the guillotine. Honourable members who have had previous experience of the guillotine know that the whole of the Committee stage may be occupied in the discussion of a few clauses, and amendments to later At portions of the Bill are never reached. By this proposal the Government are tying the hands of honourable members who might be able to submit proposals which if adopted would prevent the dislocation of the whole of the trade of this country in the near future. That possibility is staring us in the face; there is no escape from it. None of us wish to delay the passing of this Bill. We are all anxious to pass at the earliest possible moment legislation that will be acceptable to industrial unions and. prevent strikes. We do not desire to see industrial disruption; it is no good to anybody. con- Surely we should give the workers an opportunity to state what legislation they require; but how can that he done when can, from the very outset of the passage of the Bill through Parliament the Government create an adverse feeling towards their proposals? There will be strong feeling outside when the workers read that the Government are applying the guillotine to this Bill, and are not allowing adequate opportunity for their representatives to get in touch with industrial organizations in order to ascertain unionistic opinion. I take it that the Government are desirous of passing a measure that will be acceptable to the workers in order to prevent any stoppage in industry. That can be done only by all parties working together. I have some objections, not many, to the Bill in its present form. It could, I think, be considerably improved, for, , in my opinion, it does not go far enough in certain directions. If amendments were made in the way that myself and others desire,, they might be the 1 means of having the Bill readily accepted. If , on the other hand, the closure be applied, because some honourable members - take up more time than is considered necessary on certain clauses, we shall be deprived of the opportunity of getting the fullest information regarding the wishes of those most nearly concerned.",31
85,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Government just as anxious as the honourable member the is to have this measure sifted and diswe cussed.,32
86,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I can quite believe that; but the present action of the vernment"" will , I suggest, have the trary effect. The Government are entertrial ing upon a mistaken policy, and they ought really to reconsider the position. think that the Bill could be got through in a fortnight in the ordinary way; even if three weeks were occupied in its discussion the Government would be amply repaid for the time devoted to it . us It would be much better to have a good feeling amongst those outside who are the concerned, than convey to them an idea that the Government desire to have the measure put through irrespective of any improvement that might be made in it .",32
87,Mr MARRS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Wentworth) [ 4 . 3 6 ] deplore the atmosphere into which this Bill has been born. The world is groanneeded ing under industrial unrest, and Ausshould tralia presents no exception. I appeal honourable members opposite to bury that feeling of suspicion of the Bill they engendering, and to give the Government and the House the benefit of their conbers sidered judgment and advice in framing a measure that will give us industrial peace. The president of the Australian Workers Union (Mr Blakeley) is a man who could, in this connection, give us great help, and I am sorry that he should convey to us that he is not going to give the assistance we need.  sufficient time.",32
88,Mr MARRS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I am only judging from the'speech made by the honourable member, who threw the Bill on the table, as much as to say that he would have nothing more to do with it . Personally, I should have liked a little more time to look into the Bill ; but surely, honourable members opposite, as Labour representatives, mixing practically every day of the week with those who are so vitally interested, know what their supporters rethis quire in order to secure industrial peace? If the consideration of the Bill were postponed for another three weeks or a month, would honourable members opposite know more than they do now of what is desired by the workers? I doubt it very much. If those honourable members have ideas are which would tend to the improvement of Bill , they can express those'ideas when are in Committee. The Bill proposes five tribunals before which the parties concerned in industrial matters may be Gobrought together. T he round-table conconference is the only - solution of indusunrest-the bringing together of employers and employed, and abolishing that I suspicion which has always existed between capital and labour. Unfortunately, but that suspicion is gaining ground and strength by the statements made this afternoon by honourable members opposite. Let try to get r i d of this air of suspicion. I am open to conviction as to the merits of Bill , but it is certainly an earnest attempt to bring the parties together.",32
89,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC SERVICE,Do you think twenty four hours is sufficient time?,32
90,Mr MARRS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It is not twenty-four - I hours, because the Minister in charge (Sir Joseph Cook) says that if extra time is later on it will be granted. If it prove that the time allotted is not to sufficient/ I beseech the Government to grant an extension, for something must are be done in 'order to bring about industrial peace. I may tell honourable memthat just-before I left England T got to know that £5,000,000 in the hands cf a few men was waiting for investment m Australian industries, but that money has not yet come here, and will not come until we have more stable Labour conditions.",32
91,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,Where could they get more stable labour conditions ?,32
92,Mr MARRS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That money is still waiting to come here; and this Bill is, I think, an honest attempt to create conditions to attract it . Capital cannot do without labour, nor labour without capital; and I ask honourable members to restrict their speeches and. in Committee, do their best to make this an effective measure.",32
93,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,South Sydney) T4.41] I have beenwaiting to hear the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) give some reasons why Bill is made one of urgency. What is there in the industrial world that requires its immediate application? Is there any industrial upheaval that it is required to settle? ',32
94,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,The member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) said the other day that the measure could not wait a day.,33
95,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member for Dalley is not running the country; it is the Government who tell us that this Bill must become law - within the next fortnight, although no more important measure could come before us.",33
96,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,PUBLIC SERVICE,We are that there are some forty or fifty cases which cannot be dealt with by the A r b itration Court.,33
97,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,I agree with some of the provisions of the Bill .,33
98,Mr MARRS,PUBLIC SERVICE,Will not the promised upheaval in the coal industry in New South Wales require this Bill in a hurry ?,33
99,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The coal agreement be in existence until about A p r i l next. This is a new machine for the settlement of industrial disputes; and, as I say, I agree with a good deal of the Bill , but to force it through' will only create suspicion- a most injudicious thing to do for the sake of gaining a week or .two. What is the reason for the present action of the Government? Is it that the Government desire to visit German New Guinea, for a trip for which, I understand, the Australia, the Brisbane, and other warships are being fitted up ? Surely such a visit as that is not reckoned of more importance than a Bill of this kind ? I am prepared to give all fair and reasonable help to make this Bill a success, for I know a little about industrial arbitration, and recognise the defects of the present Act ; but, if we are to look for industrial harmony, we ought first to have harmony in this Parliament. The Government, however, throw down the Bill like a bone and tell us to take it or leave it .",33
100,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"How can that, when there is a fortnigh t allotted for its consideration? .",33
101,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"We do not sit days, Sundays, Mondays, or Tuesdavs, and, therefore, will have only about five days and a-half to consider the measure.",33

When I go to Sydney at the week end, I wish to consult those who are interested in the Bill , but the second told reading will then have been passed, and we shall thus be placed at a great disadvantage.

107,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Newcastle) [4.46] I say at once that I believe some legislation on the lines proposed would be somewhat cf an improvement on existing legislation, so that I do not approach the question in any mood of hostility. Like others I think that the Bill does not, in some respects, go far enough; but that is no reason why it should be treated differently from any other measure. It is proposed to completely change the system' of industrial arbitration; and surely that is a matter important enough, not only you say for free and fair discussion on the second reading and in Committee, but to permit those outside who are interested to have on Satur- some time to consider it .",33

During the war period some very important legislation had to be introduced affecting the wheat, - wool, sugar, shinping, and other interests, and, in every case, those concerned were called together and consulted in the first place. The Bill before .us will be of vital i m portance to the whole community during the next few months; and yet it is proposed to l i m it debate, and at the same time to take away any opportunity to hear the opinions and advice of those concerned.",34

113,Mr WATKINS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There were members here representing the farmers, squatters, and. others, who were consulted before important changes were made in the legislation affecting their welfare. I can see no difference between the position now, as affecting trade unions, and the position during the war as it affected those other interests. When we asked the Prime Minister to consult the people interested in such a complete change in the manner of settling"" industrial disputes, he said, "" Pass this measure, and then we shall call a conference.""",34
114,Mr MARRS,PUBLIC SERVICE,And afterwards amend the measure on any point necessary.,34

I think the Government would be well advised to delay the measure in order to allow those people who will be obliged to work under it to give some sort of consideration to a proposal affecting them so vitally. I hope that the motion will be withdrawn,, and that the measure will be allowed to take its ordinary course. If this is done, there will be no undue waste of time on the part of honourable members, whose main concern is that the people who are vitally interested in the measure should have some time in which to consider how it may affect them.",34

I am sincerely desirous of finding a medium by which to overcome the difficulties confronting us in the industrial - sphere; but the unrest in the industrial world is not on the surface; it is an economic disease which has invaded the whole system of social life throughout the wide world; and before we can obtain that peace in the social and economic conditions of life, so much desired by all people, there will need to be a decided change of system. One way of overcoming the difficulties confronting v.s may be by the passage of legislation which will find favour, and be accepted as a sincere effort on our part to achieve the desired object; but-the Government are very unwise in not accepting the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition to delay this Bill in order that organized labour may be consulted concerning its merits cr demerits. No Bill has been presented to us more skeleton in form than this is ; no Bill has come before us requiring more consideration and attention than this does. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - All the more reason why we should get on with the consideration of it .",34
117,Mr MAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"To do justice to such a measure, honourable members will require a greater length of time than the Government have provided.",34
118,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,Is that why honourable members have wasted an hour of the time that ought to have been devoted to the consideration of. the measure ?,34
119,Mr MAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It is not a question of wasting an hour. We are anxious to obtain from the Government consideration in respect to further time, so that the merits and demerits of the measure may receive the attention they should have, and in order that organized labour may be consulted, for only in this way can we arrive at unanimity in the framing of a Bill that will guarantee industrial peace in the future.",34

121,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Y a r r a ) [5.2] - Honor able members across the chamber have taunted the Opposition with the fact that we consult outsiders. I frankly admit that I have done so in regard to this Bill . Last Thursday, before the Prime Minister moved the second reading, I telephoned to the secretary of the Melposition, bourne Trades H all Council, the most important body of organized labour i Victoria, and told him that I would like to have a talk with members of his execushould tive in regard to the measure. As a sult of that message, I had a conversato tion with the president and secretary the Trades H all Council, and, strange to say, the Prime Minister"" (Mr . Hughes), when moving the second reading, went out of his way to compliment the Victorian Industrial Disputes Com16 mittee, which is practically the Trades H all Council executive, for the manner AYES. in which it had exercised its powers in the interests of maintaining industrial peace.",35
122,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,Was it not a welldeserved compliment?,35
123,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes ; yet honourable members taunt me with having consulted outsiders. It is true that I have consulted the men who have done more to preserve industrial peace in Victoria than has been done by any other body of men. At their invitation I attended a meeting of the executive last night, where it was unanimously agreed that it would be advisable to have the IndusNOES. trial Peace Bill deferred u n t i l a conference of organized labour could meet.. The existing facilities for travelling permit of such a conference meeting in Melbourne early next week. There need not be more than three representatives from each State. I remember that when a conference of representatives of all sections of the community throughout the Commonwealth was convened, all the PAIBS. parties to it assembled in Melbourne within four days of the call being made.",35
124,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,Who should call the conference which the honourable member suggests should be convened?,35
125,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Government.,35
126,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Government have already called one.,35
127,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,That is not so as far as a Labour Conference is concerned.,35
128,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,For the last three months the Prime Minister has been endeavouring to have a conference held.,35
129,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I asked the Prime M i nister if that was the conference I requested, and he said "" No . "" I shall deal with the conference the Government have called. I do not wish to misrepresent the because this matter is too serious to make party capital out of it . But the n measure is being dealt with in a manner thab will generate, whereas our endeavour be to allay, suspicion.' I have reapproached its consideration with a view securing harmony, or at least trying to of make things better than they are. There is no need to create discord today, be-cause there is already enough of it in the world. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) said that he knew persons in England, who had £5,000,000 to invest, but would not invest it in Australia, because there was too much unrest here. To what country will they take it? Is there any other where there is less unrest? The Prime Minister stated in his opening remarks that the securing of in dustrial peace is a wide-world problem.",35
130,Mr MATHEWS,PUBLIC SERVICE,We are compared with the people of other countries.,36
131,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I do not say that the workers of Australia are lamb-like; they stand up for their rights just as do others elsewhere; and good luck to them. The Prime Minister said today that he had called a conference of organized labour and organized employers, and that the Melbourne Trades Hall had declined to attend it . I went to the Trades Hal l Executive last night, and I know that they were unanimous in wishing for a Labour Conference to consider this Bill .",36
132,Mr MASSYGREENE,PUBLIC SERVICE,The conference that the Government endeavoured to get to review the legislation before its presentation to Parliament was a conference of Labour and employers. The honourable member is talking of a conference of labour organizations only.,36
133,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is so; I am not referring now to the conference that the Government has called. The Prime Minister has said that both bodies have asked that the consideration of this measure may be deferred, which, he says, is evidence that the Bill is satisfactory. If there is anything that should prove that it is unsatisfactory, it is that both side3 ask for the opportunity to consider it . The measure goes to the bed-rock of. our industrial and social conditions; but, in my opinion, three weeks would allow of its consideration in the manner I have asked for. The Prime Minister tells us that a representative on the opposite side of the House has also asked for the deferring of the consideration of the measure. went on to say that if a conference representing Labour and employers met and suggested amendments, those amendments would be carried into effect. opinion, it would be better to make our legislation as perfect as possible in the first instance. I have a fairly intimate knowledge of industrial conditions in Victoria, but it is impossible for a man who has to attend in his place here to have as intimate a knowledge of them as is possessed by those who are working in the trade unions. Twenty years ago, when still working at my trade, I knew a good deal more about the industrial conditions of the day than I do now; and that is true, not only of the trade at which I was efnployed, but of other industries.",36
134,Mr MARRS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"But if there is anything lamb-like wrong, the unions keep you in touch.",36
135,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is so. On only two other occasions has a time l i m it been fixed for the consideration of a measure. The consideration of the Electoral Bill and the last Constitution Alteration Bill was limited in this way. This B i ll is of the greatest importance to the workers. I make no apology for speaking as a representative of the workers. I do my best to represent them as I think they would desire to be represented. I have asked that theyshall have an opportunity . to consider the Bill , but the reply is that the B i ll must be passed by a certain hour next week. The trade unions are not very keen about arbitration, and at some of the State Labour Conferences resolutions have been passed for the taking of the arbitration plank out of our platform.",36
136,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Does not the Bill practically provide for that?,36
137,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It will , in effect, wipe out the Arbitration Court.",36
138,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It will wipe out the Arbitration Court, or, at any rate, it will make it very ineffective. But the Prime Minister does not say that. He says that its object is'to strengthen the Arbitration Court. H is strengthening of the A r b i tration Court reminds me of the remark of the man who, when it was proposed to cut off the tai l of a dog, suggested that it be cut off just behind the ears. That is how the Prime Minister proposes to deal with the Arbitration Court. His are back-handed methods. If honourable He members who support the Government think that the Arbitration Court is wrong, let them move to repeal the Act which established it , and - let them point In my out the decisions which they regard as unsatisfactory. The Bill does not purport to wipe out the Arbitration Court. Many years ago Sir George Reid, when in Opposition, said that he would not care who passed the laws of the country, or what sort of laws were passed, so long as he might have the administering of them. No measure has ever heen before Parliament in regard to which administration will be of more importance than this Bill. Everything will depend upon its administration. The last election showed that organized Labour polled tliree-sevenths of the total votes, although, according to the Prime Minister, many had left its ranks. Honourable members who are desirous of stamping on trade unionism, who would wipe it out",36
139,Mr MARRS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No one wishes for that. ' Mr TUDOR - Some honourable members do. The Prime Minister says that the Bill is to give the trade unions a status. He says that the proposed tribunals will give organized Labour a recognised status and influence in this country. But what clause of the Bill recognises organized Labour at all? At the present time only organizations can get to the Arbitration Court, and the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) says , that the Bill will wipe out that Court. Therefore, the Bill wipes out a power which organized Labour has today. There is not one word here for organized Labour.",37
140,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,That correct. Clause 11 says that the powers and functions of a district council shall include the power to inquire into any industrial matter brought before it by any employers or employees or by any association of employers or employees.,37
141,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,We have had bogus organizations of employees in Victoria.,37
142,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Bill does not shut out bond fide organizations.,37
143,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"They are not mentioned from the beginning to the end of it, as I shall show. When the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) was manager of the Worleer, before he left the Labour party",37
144,Mr LAVELLE,PUBLIC SERVICE,Before he was expelled from 'it.,37
145,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,Before Labour party illegally put me out.,37
146,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,That newspaper used to denounce the bogus organization that was kept in existence by the pastoralists of New South Wales. . Mr MCDONALD - And of Queensland.,37
147,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes . I refer to the Machine Shearers Union. The former representative of Wentworth (Mr Kelly) said that the Machine Shearers Union would take the place of the Australian Workers Union; but history has proved that the Australian Workers Union is stronger than ever, and the bogus union is not now in existence. In Victoria a man namedPacker has run a number of bogus organizations, such as the bogus Agricultural Implement Workers Union, and the bogus Tramway Employees Union. These were always patted on the back by the Nationalists, and were kept in existence with their money; I say that deliberately. To-day you will see advertisements in the newspapers on behalf of the National Labour party, run by a man named Glance, calling for nominations as National Labour candidates. Are these to be run against any Nationalist? No ; they are to be used as they were used at the last election, when such candidates were run against me, the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey), the honourable  and the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), and it is the same on this occasion; they are only being run against is not Labour members. Under the Bill the organizations have to be recognised. By whom? By the Governor General in Council. He could recognise the bogus Glance organizations, and refuse to recognise the genuine Labour organizations. Do honourable members think that industrial peace is to be got in that way?",37
148,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,Nothin g you have said supports your contention that the Bill excludes the Labour organizations.,37
149,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Under the Standing Orders my time is limited to an hour and five minutes. Had an honourable member on this side interjected as often as the honourable member has done, he would be outside now. The honourable member  retire for making fewer interjections than the the honourable member has now indulged in. It would have been advisable if the Government had consulted organized labour. I am informed that organized employers were also anxious to be consulted. We have been told by political opponents that this measure merely introduces a third tribunal to which the employees may appeal. It is emphasized that they already have the Arbitration Court, and, in some bf th© States, a Wages Board system. It has been stated that manufacturers will not know where they are if this latest Bill is put into operation. I am anxious that any means shall be adopted-so long as it is fair to the workers and, indeed, to all sides-for the bringing about of that state .of affairs which Australia is - hopeful of seeing. I am familiar with the attitude of many employers at the time of the passing of the Factories Act in Victoria. I was then a member of the executive of the Melbourne Trades H all Council, and, at the time of my election to this Parliament I was President of that body. When Victoria passed its Factories Act many of the employers endeavoured to secure the election of non-unionist employees to the Boards. In industries where there was no trade union organization the employers often dismissed employees who even attended meetings called for the purpose of selecting representatives to Wages Boards. I recall the circumstances surrounding the appointment of the Whiteworkers Board, over which the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell) presided as its first chairman. Br. MALONEY - And 12s. 6d. a week was held to be good enough as wages..",37
150,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I know all about that, but I do not propose to go into that phase of the matter now. I do know that at one of the big whiteworking establishments in this city the employers dismissed several hands for attending a meeting which had been convened to create a Wages Board for that industry. Those emolc'yers who opposed the creation of Boards under the Factories Act are just as anxious today to k ill any measure which contains any proposition for the provement of the worker's lot. Some honourable members opposite have stated that the Bill now before the House has been introduced to wipe out the Arbitration Court. Whether or not honourable members have said .that, in so many words, I am sure they are hopeful that the effect will be to wipe out the Court.",38
151,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,A great many of your people will not go before the Court today.,38
152,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is not correct. As far as I know, there is only one large organization in the Commonwealth which refuses to go to the Court. I hold in my hand a paper containing a list of forty-three organizations, among which there are .ten or a dozen which, if any one of them took action, could hold up the whole of Australia's industries. An y system that will prove more expeditious than the Arbitration Court in bringing about settlements of trouble will receive my hearty support, but I do not intend to vote for a measure under which a bogus organization may receive recognition and representation in place of a bond fide trade union organization. There were various bogus unions in those days of which I have spoken. There was a bogus gas workers union; there was a bogus agricultural implement workers union, and a bogus tramways employees organization. The donations received by those bodies were much greater than the actual contributions of their members. I have belonged to trade unions in Australia and in other parts of the world, and my experience has been that we have never received one penny from outside by way of donation. A former president of the Employers Federation, Mr Blackwood, who was at one time a, member of this Chamber, once admitted having sent money to bogus organizations. Under this Bill the Government can give recognition to bogus unions. The Machine Shearers Union can be recognised and the Australian Workers Union ignored. Fortunately, organized labour today is strong enough to demand that it shall be recognised.",38
153,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,Is not the honourable member beating the air if that is true?,38
154,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No ; the unions today are strong, but not owing to the work i m - of honourable members behind the Government. Those who speak for organized labour are rightly suspicious of what may be the outcome of this Bill , so far as recognition of bogus bodies are concerned. They rightly claim that before this measure is passed they should be consulted. I warn the Government that unless bond fide labour is brought within the four corners of this measure they cannot expert it to be a success.",38
155,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is provided in this Bill , as I understand it .",38
156,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I i thero is such promoving vision I shall have pleasure in moving, in Cominattee, for the inclusion, of a definidustrial tion to the effect that the word. "" organibeen z at i o n "" means an organization registered in accordance with the Conciliation Arbitration Act, and means also orgaFederation nizations recognised by the H all Councils of the various States being the bond fide Trade Union in that particular industry. There cannot be dustrial peace if bond fide labour organizations are kept outside the scope of this Bill. We cannot, within this B i l tend the powers possessed by the Comto monwealth under the Constitution. the Prime Minister himself pointed outI t is now quite clear that the powers Commonwealth in relation to industrial ters are covered entirely by the words of graph xxxv. of section 51 of the Constitution, which reads as follows:Conciliation and arbitration for the prethere was no power to vary it . vention and settlement of industrial putes extending beyond the limits of one State. The Prime Minister admitted, in his second-reading speech, that practically every organization can go before tration Court to-d'ay.",39
157,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,Will not this Bill . perhaps prevent organizations fro m going there?,39
158,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No , I do not think it made can prevent them. The honourable may remember that, in the early days of Federation, Mr Mauger-representin the time, I believe, Melbourne Ports - gav e notice of a motion to the effect that the Wages Boards sysmotion, tem should be made a Federal matT ter. The proposition was supported by honourable members on both sides. The then Art.ing Leader of the Opposition, Sir William MCMillan, who had been a fore the Arbitration Court. member of the Federal Convention, reployers marked that if the Convention had been sitting at that time it undoubtedly have handed over industrial matters to the Federal authority. More than once since that date the people have been asked to confer that power upon the Commonwith wealth, but they have not so far contion. sented.",39
159,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PUBLIC SERVICE,The forthcoming Convent on may give that power. :,39
160,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Eve n so, such a decision most be confirmed by the people. When the second reading of this Bill the Prime Minister stated that the in - . problem: was a great one and had intensified owing to the war. That is quite t r u e ; but why?' I propose to and quote the president of the Employers (Senator Fairbainj), who stated Trades that the chief cause of industrial disputes as at present is the ever-changing cost of living, and that power should be granted in - to the Court to make awards contingent on the rise or f all of the cost of living. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) some time ago moved l , exthe adjournment of this House in order present reasons why the Arbitration As Act should be amended. This occurred during last Parliament, before the Prime of the Minister had returned to Australia from matattending the Peace Conference, and after parathe decision of the High Court to the effect that once an award had been made Every disJudge of the Arbitration Court has asked any that that position should be reversed, and . every Judge of the High Court has supported the request. The Arbitration Court should be superior to the tribunals proposed to be set up by this Bill ; but the A r b i - clause 17 states:Notwithstanding anything in this Act, if a special tribunal is satisfied that abnormal circumstances have arisen which affect the fundamental justice of any terms of an award by the Court, the tribunal may set aside member or vary any terms so affected. That means, in effect, that these tribunals g at are to be given power which is not possessed by the Arbitratio n Court. When the Prime Minister gave notice of for the introduction of this Bill , remarked that he should first introduce the Bill to amend the Arbitration Act. There should not be. as is the fact today, forty-three organizations waiting to go beThe emshould not be in a position to place obstacles in the way of organizations would of employees going before the Court. One feature of the Bill that meets with my approval is the fact that it does away lawyers in connection with arbitraI am in favour of that. Lawyers merely raise legal objections and technicalities, and often prevent justice being done. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley"") could tell the House how much the Australian Workers Union has had to pay in order to pet an award from the Arbitration Court. I have been informed that it cost the boot trade organization over £5,000, and some other organizations have paid very much more than that. Our duty is to make arbitration simpler and less costly; but I do not think this Bill will do it .",39
161,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Oh , yes !",40
162,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Oh , n o ! If the pastoralists of New South Wales are able to get men to work in their sheds upon conditions not acceptable to the organized workers, what is to prevent them forming a bogus union, as they did in the past, and the Government giving recognition to the bogus union and not to the genuine one?",40
163,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,There is no provision in this Bill that will give a right to any particular body to represent the workers in an industry.,40
164,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Bill provides that the Governor General may establish a Commonwealth Council of industrial representatives, consisting of a chairman and an even number of other members not exceeding six, but that the chairman shall be appointed by the Governor General. Many organizations have doubts about that provision.",40
165,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,They are unreasonable.,40
166,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Are they? I pointed out last week that on the Advisory Council of the Institute of Industry and Commerce, established by the Commonwealth, there were eighteen anti-Labour representatives and only three spokesmen for Labour. Judging by that experience, what type of man will the Government select as chairman of the Commonwealth Industrial Council?",40
167,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Does the honourable member 'call everybody anti-Labour who does not belong to a Labour organization ? LABOUR MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",40
168,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The members of the Council of the Institute of Science and Industry comprised squatters, insurance agents, shipping agents, and others as to whose political sympathies there could be no doubt. What sort of chairman would be appointed under this Bill by the present Government? No measure that has [134] ever been introduced into this Parliament leaves more to administration than does this Bill . Under it , the Government could really do anything.",40
169,Mr MARRS,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Commonwealth Council will only investigate and report; it will be the special tribunal that will do the trick, and the chairman of the special tribunal will be chosen by its members. Mr TUDOR,-Or , in default of agreement amongst the members, by the Governor General. I would sooner leave the appointment, of the chairman to ithe President of the Arbitration Court. Honourable members say that they want conciliation and the principle of the round-table conference. Why make an appointment of the chairman a part)' matter ?",40
170,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,Is not the President of the Arbitration Court appointed by the Governor General ?,40
171,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes , but his appointment took place so long ago that it can have no party significance today.",40
172,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,The present Judges will not live for .ever.,40
173,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member is apparently anxious to justify any support he gives to this Bill , including the very appointment of a party man as chairman of the Commonwealth Industrial Council. I repeat that I would prefer the appointment to be made by the President of the Arbitration Court. I agree with the statement made on the 12th A p r i l last by Senator Fairbairn, President of the Employers Federation, that the chief cause of in dustrial disputes at the' present time is the ever-changing cost of living. Industrial unrest is due to profiteering. The Prime Minister promised to shoot the profiteer, but he has not done so. We have not got r i d of the profiteer. When some of us in this Parliament proposed to deal with profiteering, we were told 'that this matter must be left to the States. Honourable members opposite shirked their duty and their responsibilities by asking, in effect, "" A m I my brother's keeper?"" We have our responsibilities in regard to profiteering, and we should shoulder them. If honourable members think that this Bill contains anything to cure or allay in dustrial unrest, I am surprised at them agreeing to rush it through the House faster than any industrial measure that has ever been before the Parliament. Organized labour is to be prevented from' having an opportunity to consider the Bill , and we were told by the Prime M in ister that a Government supporter also had asked that the consideration of the Bill should be deferred, in order to allow the Chambers of Manufactures and the Employers Federation a chance to study its bearings.",40
174,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC SERVICE,Does not the honourable member think that those bodies had an opportunity to consider it f,41
175,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Apparently, what the Prime Minister said, they had not. Some honourable members opposite, before the Prime Minister spoke, apr plauded the suggestion that the matter should be deferred, so that the Bill might be considered in detail by the organizations outside. The Melbourne Trades H all Council refused the invitation of the Government",41
176,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,What use of waiting for people who will not do .anything ?,41
177,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,The honourable member must have been asleep or out of the chamber when I stated earlier that that is the very .body that asked that it should be given an opportunity to consider the measure.,41
178,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Certainly , speeches are sumcient to send one to sleep.",41
179,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,I have never known the honourable member's head to burst with excess of brains. He could not get into Parliament until he was taken up by the anti-Labour party. The TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Atkinson) - Order !,41
180,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The statement happens to be absolutely true, and I do not know that it is out of order. The TEMPORARY - SPEAKER - I have ruled it out of order, at any rate.",41
181,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Arbitratio n Court has been responsible for a good deal of - delay in the hearing of plaints. The Ausby both sides. tralian Institute of Marine Engineers, ^which, by striking, could hold up industry throughout Australia, lodged a plaint twelve months ago. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers, which could hold up the whole of the commerce of Australia, lodged a plaint ten months ago; the Waterside Workers Federation, seven months ago; the Australian Workers Union, in January of this year; the Federated Marine Stewards and Pantrymen's Association, and the Federated Engine Drivers' and Firemen's Association, in A p r i l of this year. If any one of those organizations were to go on strike tomorrow, on account of the difficulty of getting their cases heard by the Arbitration Court, the wheels of industry from throughout Australia would be stopped. Will this Bill improve the position?",41
182,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,Immensely .,41
183,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I should like to be as optimistic as the honourable member, but I claim to be more closely in touch with the industrial organizations today than is the honourable member. is the Mr HECTOR LAMOND - The honourable member cannot claim to have a closer knowledge of industrial, organizations than I have.",41
184,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have been for many years, and am still, closely connected with the industrial organizations of Australia, and I believe that this Bill can be made more effective for good than it is at the present time. I suggested one means, but the the Government rejected it . If honourable members could have voted as they honestly believed",41
185,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,The honourable member is always insinuating that there is no honest man but himself. I claim to vote just as honestly as does the honourable member.,41
186,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"There are other members in the House besides the chatterer from Illawarra. I am more closely in touch with industrial organizations than the ' honourable member is today, and I say that, unless honourable members oppoDEPUTY site work whole-heartedly, with us, the Bill cannot be the success it should. I know what party ties mean as well as does any honourable member in the House; and I wish the Bill to be thoroughly considered I desire separate conferences; of employers and employed, to be followed, perhaps, by a joint conference, and I am doing my best to put the workers' side.",41
187,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It would be better to have the recommendations of a joint conunions, ference than conflicting recommendations from separate conferences.",42
188,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It would be well to have recommendations from both sides, because it does not matter whether it be a Judge or member of Parliament, he cannot have that knowledge of any ticular trade that those engaged in have.",42
189,Mr BOWDEN,PUBLIC SERVICE,That has been the ficulty.,42
190,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,It has.,42
191,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC SERVICE,The difficulty is not got over by this Bill.,42
192,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Of course, it is not. there are special tribunals, and recognised labour is left without representation, bogus labour is allowed to take part, we cannot have the success desired. It is presentatives. this lack of representation that recognised labour is tired of. The Trades Hall Council' in Melbourne is, at least, as reheard of it . presentative of organized labour as any Trades Council in Australia; it may safely claim to represent at least 95 per cent, of organized labour in this State, but if any one were to go to the union representatives to-night and tell them that they need not be alarmed about the closure being applied to prevent inquiry or thing. examination, does any one think that such a statement would be accepted?",42
193,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PUBLIC SERVICE,Some of the unions have asked for a time-limit for the Arbitration Court.,42
194,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I believe that if lawthe yers were eliminated from the Arbitration Court we should have greater expedition. In the Court, at present, lawyers every; technical point as against the ployees with a view of making this mode of seeking redress too expensive for It is claimed by some that the arbitration principle has failed, but I do not think that the Court has failed, though it not been as successful as we hoped. Perriers sonally, I welcome anything that would lead to more expedition, but I do not pose to support any proposal which might lead to one-sided tribunals. We have had [134]- 2 some experience in Victoria with Wages Boards and the representation that is given on them. The Factories Acts are an outcome of the efforts of the trades without which we should have had no industrial legislation on the statute book of any State; yet the labour organizations have' not the power of electing their representatives on these Boards. That, of course, is one of the weaknesses of the Factories Act, though I admit parthat in practically every case the it unions are strong enough to control the representation. It may be said that in . pretty well all cases the difunions have that control; but I remind the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) of an incident in connection with the Wages Board of which he was chairman. In that case the proprietor of a big shop in Bourke-street, If who was a prominent member of one of the Protestant churches, dismissed his and employees who attended even the preliminary meeting for the selection of re",42
195,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,That is the first I have,42
196,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I know it to be true, for my sister-in-law was one of the dismissed employees, and I took her to the Trades Hall Council, of which I was a member.",42
197,Dr MALONEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,The evidence had to be taken in camera to prevent that sort of,42
198,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"What the employers have done in the past I am afraid they will do in the future. It ought to be specified that .the organization to elect the employees' representatives shall be recognised organization of the industry concerned, such as the Australian Workers Union, the Shale and raise Coal-workeTs Union, the Boot Trade emUnion, and so on; because, as I say, if bogus organizations are admitted we them. cannot hope for success. The manufacturers themselves take every care to see that they are properly represented; as has witness cases in which the master carof Victoria were concerned. Their organization had a rule that no member prowas to quote against another member in the case of a contract, and that if any one got into difficulties, with horses down and so forth, others must not go to his assistance. That organization closed its books against fresh members, as did the timber merchants and master grocers. No member on this side of the House claims to represent any employers' association; at any rate, I have never had to thank one for returning me, and I never shall. It is said that there is no danger in the representation that is proposed, but the employees' organizations have fears on that ground. As I have said, I desire a definition of "" recognised organization,"" and suggest that it should be the organization recognised by the Trades Hall. not think there are any organizations that are not registered at ti e Arbitration Court or recognised by the Trades Halls, and we can have both admitted in order to prevent bogus organizations. There are four tribunals proposed-Federal , State, special and local-and in the case of the special tribunal there is no provision made for any particular number of representatives, so that it might consist of one from each side, whereas, in my opinion, there ought to be more. In the case of the shipping tribunal there is a representative of the workers, a representative of the employers, and an independent chairman, and the Prime Minister has told us that this tribunal has given 256 decisions. In a transport case, for instance, the carters and drivers, the seamen, and, perhaps, the waterside workers should have representation.",42
199,Unknown,PUBLIC SERVICE,Sitting suspended from 6 to 6.7 p.m. in consequence of the failure of the electric light.,43
200,Mr TUDOR,PUBLIC SERVICE,"T n the few minutes remaining at my disposal I wish to point out the weakness of this Bill. For one thing, no power is given to call evidence upon some most important matters. No doubt, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), in presenting the case for the coal miners, will tell us why this section of workers have objected even to the Arbitration Court, and show that the Court, does not take into consideration profits made and freights paid today. Honourable members will remember that a Justice of the High Court, in giving his decision in the Coal Vend case, admitted that the Coal Vend charged private firms more than others had to pay. For instance, the . Melbourne Glass Bottle Works were charged more for their coal than the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, who consumed less coal, were asked to pay. In order to be effective, the proposed tribunals should be given greater power to compel persons to attend before them and give evidence. The tribunals should not be one-sided, which they may be under the provisions of the Bill. Undoubtedly, trade unionists will view this Bill with suspicion because of the manneT in which it is being rushed through, without a fair opportunity I do being given for the discussion of it. The workers protest against nothing more than they do against the U3e of the ""gag."" Nothing had such a far-reaching effect on the 1910 elections than did the impression the public had gained that the Deakin Government had sought to prevent the Labour party from being heard. It is possible that the contents of this Bill have not been published in Western Australia. How can the workers there, or the workers of Queensland, realise the effect the measure will have on industry? I think the Government would have been well advised to defer the consideration of the Bill in order to give both sides an opportunity to consider it, and, if necessary, make representations here through their respective representatives. The recognised organizations ought to have had this opportunity. I am not referring to bogus unions, such as the Machine Shearers Union, which the pastoralists brought into existence, and tried to keep alive, nor bogus organizations which the Employers Federation in Victoria have brought into existence, such as the bogus Agricultural Implement Workers, the bogus Tramway Union, and the bogus Gasworkers Union. If ever there was a measure depending on the hearty co-operation of both sides, this is one; but if it is rushed through without the workers being given the opportunity to consider it ; if the bond fide unions get the impression that this Bill is being rushed through to "" sell the worker a pup""-borrowin g an expression made use of by the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie)-the y will have absolutely nothing to do with it, and what might have been a good piece of legislation will at once be prevented from being the success it would otherwise have been.",43
201,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Hunter) [6.12] This is a very important Bill, because it seeks to alter the principle that has been followed in regard to arbitration legislation since its inception in the Commonwealth; and in order to get a grip of the question, and deal with it in a proper manner, it is necessary for us to carry our minds back some years. As the result of the general wish, not only of industrialists, but also of the community as a whole, to have some means whereby industrial troubles might be settled without recourse to strikes or lockouts, an Arbitration Bill was introduced in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales by Mr B. R. Wise in the year 1901. I had the honour of attending a Conference convened by Mr Wise, comprising representatives of trade unions from every part of the State. It was called together so that Mr Wise could become acquainted with the views of those who could guide him in framing his Bill, and had the same course been followed on this occasion the conditions surrounding the introduction of the Bill now before usmight have been more satisfactory. Honourable members know the history of industrial legislation in the State of New South Wales, and how it was that, on account of the great congestion of cases listed for hearing which the Court was unable to deal with, what is known as the Wages Board system superseded the Arbitration Court, and has ever since been in operation. But whether the system adopted be to have an Arbitration Court or Wages Boards, it is a fundamental principle of all our industrial legislation that the workers are given full recognition through their trade unions. No matter how good the machinery may be. for the settlement of industrial disputes, the workers will not accept it unless their unions have recognition. However, that fundamental principle of our industrial legislation of the past is absent from the Bill before us today. For the first time we depart from the recognition of industrial unionism, and make it possible for any bogus union which may come into existence, after the passing of this niea.'iire, to secure a tribunal if it extends beyond the confines of any one State, and so come into conflict with existing bond fide trade unions. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) was quite right in pointing out the omission of this fundamental basis of arbitration, which the industrial unions will assuredly claim ought to find a place in the Bill. It is idle for the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) to say that these bogus unions already have the power under the existing Act. The power is not there. Let the Prime Minister compare the definition sections of the New South Wales Act and the Commonwealth Act, which makes provision for industrial unions to be registered. I would not go so far as that, but I claim that only the recognised trade .union in any particular industry should be the body to take part in the formation of a council, ! Board, or tribunal, as the case may be. Unless that provision is made in this Bill, it will meet with strong opposition. Many of the coal miners in New South Wales who took no part in the industrial trouble brought about by the railway employees in that State, although it was claimed over here that they were parties to it , were victimized through the action of the State Government, and not permitted to return to work. When I raised my voice in this House, pointing out that injustice was being done to certain persons in New South Wales, my remarks were unheeded; but now the facts have become public property. Certain men who were engaged in Victoria to go to work in N«w South Wales turned out to be failures when they arrived there; but if they were still working there, and others might be working in Victoria, under this - Bill they could get a Board to decide the conditions of their employment. Also, in the case of the wharf labourers, the regular unionists were supplanted by other men, both here and in Sydney, and as it became an Inter-State matter, if the provisions of this Bill had been in operation, those men'could have applied for recognition, and the appointment of a tribunal to deal with an industrial dispute. The legitimate body of wharf labourers would have been shut out, and the bogus union might have accepted conditions of employment quite at wariance with those applying in the industry before their time. As the members of such bogus unions only work when other people are in trouble, they really are not acquainted with the conditions applying to the particular industry they are following for the time being., Nevertheless, they can shut out the recognised unions, and have conditions of work fixed quite different from those applying right through the history of particular callings. I consider this the fundamental mistake of the Bill. No matter how disposed the unions may be to accept this form of legislation, I am sure they could not accept it without per provision being made for the recognition of the bona fide unions that have 'been in existence in the various industries. It may have been an oversight on the part of the draftsman, or on the part of the Government, but certainly we are not justified in passing a measure whose provisions are contrary to the Tecognised customs of arbitration. I do not say that the machinery proposed to be set up might not be in some respects an improvement on the existing machinery, and I believe that the time has arrived when we must get machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes within a reasonable time. The chief cause of the failure of 1 arbitration is that this has not hitherto been possible. Some of the more powerful industrial unions will not register as organizations, and will have nothing to do with the Arbitration Court. The miners, whom I represent, take that stand. They do. so because, in 1901, they registered, and found that it t6ok over two years to get some of their plaints heard. At the end of two years circumstances are often quite different from what they were when a dispute occurred, and it is idle to conduct an investigation. They found, too, that they had often to stop work in order to procure the hearing of their grievances. The Act was passed to prevent strikes, but it has really offered an incentive to the men - to do something to get before the Court. I shall not say that the tribunals proposed to be. set up are exactly what are required, but I believe that the miners would welcome a measure providing for the settlement of their disputes locallv. and as they occurred. If a local Board could deal with a dispute at a particular mine, and settle it, ,or send it on to a special tribunal, the men would feel that their grievances were being heard within a reasonable time, and would be willing to continue at work. Therefore,, these 3Ir. Charlton. tribunals, if put on a proper footing, may be acceptable. There is great unrest in the coal mining industry, and any stoppage in the supply of coal affects every part of Australia. The miners themselves are endeavouring to prevent a disturbance, and their leaders are anxious that there shall be no stoppage in the production of coal, because they know how necessary it is for the welfare of the country that prosufficient coal should be available. I say this in justice to the leaders, because men in their position are often maligned when trouble occurs. The men desire to have their case fairly considered. The Bill does not provide for that, which is the chief objection they will urge against it. There is not sufficient power given to do what they desire. I believe that the miners could obtain an increase in wages; but what they desire is to know whether such an increase can be given to them without increasing the price of coal to the consumer. They are of opinion, rightly or wrongly, that at present prices their wages could be increased so as to make them equal to what they were prior to the war, having regard to the increase in the cost of living, and they ask for an inquiry into the facts. When a conference was held in Sydney recently, the Prime Minister was led to believe that the employers were prepared to agree to a tribunal which would have power to investigate every phase of coal production up to the point of distribution; but in Melbourne the proprietors would not agree to that. It is said that the miners have no right to know anything of the business of the proprietors beyond what is necessary for the - fixing of the hewing rates. In coal mining there is a system of payment by results. Prior to the war there was a declared selling price, according to which the miners' wages were fixed on a sliding scale, under which they benefited by a certain .percentage for every rise of Is. in the price of coal. They contended, however, that they should know exactly what price was got for the coal; that the coal might be sold at a higher price than the "" declared price."" That furnished matter for dispute for years, when the "" ascertained price"" was given. But that is not satisfactory. Circumstances have changed completely since arbitration was introduced in 1901. Since then the employers generally have combined, and by hiring the ablest brains have heen able to use methods for getting ibehind the Act, and making it impossible to inquire into all the ramifications of their business. Formerly the miners had to deal only with the colliery proprietors; but today the steam-ship companies throughout Australia hold a controlling interest in many of the mines. They are chiefly the largest mines. owners declare a price for coal at Newcastle- I am speaking of normal times, when the War Precautions Act is not operating-but.whe n the coal is sold in Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, or any other State, charges are made for freight, labour, and so on, which make its cost very high. Our men say that it is too high, and they ask for a full inquiry, to see whether they could not be given an increase of wages out of the profits which are earned without increasing the cost of coal to the consumers.",44
202,Unknown,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. Mr Charlton. - I desire to place on record particulars in connection with the earnings of off-hand labourers, who are at present the principal cause of unrest, and in regard to whom there is a significant paragraph in this evening's press, according to which the situation is very gloomy. I desire to show that these men have uot been earning a living wage, notwithstanding the high price being charged for coal. The figures which I shall present are taken in respect of the wages of men who are paid at the rate of 13s. 6d. a day. At a recent conference with the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) the proprietors offered 14s. 6d. per day, but the men refused this extra shilling on the ground that it was inadequate. They want a special tribunal to deal immediately with the matter of wages, and, thereafter, to hear their claims generally for better working conditions. Honourable members should remember that, in dealing with these miners, their wage3 must not be calculated by the day. They must be reviewed on the basis of annual totals, or of weekly earnings. In mining the work is by no means regular. It depends greatly upon trade prospects, and upon the demand for coal. It must not be forgotten, either, that when the men are not actually engaged they cannot pick up work elsewhere. They must be on the spot ready to begin when required. The particulars are as follow:AGGREGATE EARNINGS AND AVERAGE. WEEKL Y EARNINGS EOR THE YEAR 1919.

It must be evident to honourable members, that these day labourers are not making a living wage. They are very impatient,' and, personally, I do not think it is possible to hold them for any length of time.' We wantto try to prevent an upheaval, but unless a tribunal can be created which will have power to inquire into every; phase of the industry, there is bound to, be trouble. I emphasize that the offer of Is. a day more is regarded by the men- 1 as quite insufficient. They are demanding the fullest inquiry to ascertain whether or not the present, charge for coal warrants an increase in wages, still leaving a fair return upon capital invested. That is a fair request, and honourable members on this side had hoped to find provision in the Bill to meet that request; but there is not such provision. men have been advocating a tribunal of this kind for a considerable time. It is because the Bill does not provide necessary machinery for an investigation of the whole business of coal production from the first point of production to the final distribution, that it is regarded as being of no use.",46
203,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,What is the period covered by those figures which the honourable member has provided ?,47
204,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"They cover a term beginning on Sth May, 1919, and ending on 8th March, 1920.",47
205,Mr BAMFOED,PUBLIC SERVICE,Who furnished those figures?,47
206,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member can get the particulars from the Mines Reports of New South Wales and work them out for himself, so checking my ownfigures. - Sir GBAJTVILLE RYKIE - Is the per day calculated on the number of days actually worked or on the total of days in that ten months' period ?",47
207,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The figures are based on the days actually worked. order to full y in f o rm honourable members of the situation, I will place on record the following press report of 3rd August:Representatives of the top-hands employed at the various collieries on the Maitland coalfield met at Cessnock on Saturday to deal with matters seriously affecting them, and to devise means of having them given the earliest attention'. Mr W. North presided, and Mr. W. Lane was appointed secretary for the meeting. The delegates considered the position as it was presented from each colliery, and decided that the time had arrived for decisive action in reference to their claims for a living wage. It was pointed out that there was no desire or suggestion that they should break away from the federation, as some of the mine-owners and others wished; but,-at the same time, while determined to do nothing that would weaken their forces by disunion, they were as equally determined that their cause was not going to be shelved,, bat rather that the federation would be called upon very plainly 'to see that they received justice. The following resolutions were unanimously adopted:-That a conference of delegates of top-hands employed on the Maitland coal-field be held at Weston on - Sunday afternoon; that the men working on the pit-tops at all the collieries be requested to send delegates; that this conference of top-hands recommends to the Weston conference to be held on Sunday afternoon that an aggregate meeting be immediately held, and that the position of the pit topThe bands be fully discussed and a plan of action mapped out; that this conference .demands that at any conference between'the federation and the mine-owners direct representation be given the top-hands on the matter of wages scale for top-hands. The top-hands admit having been told that they have been represented by top-bands at conferences, but they demand that they shall be represented by delegates selected by their conference or directly representative of it, in order that their views might be fully expressed and their claims urged by men fully authorized by the top-hands - themselves. The fact that many of them are not receiving a living wage is responsible for the unrest prevailing, and the reports presented by delegates show conclusively that there is more than talk in their contention. Every class of labour on the coal-field admits the justice of the claims made for a living wage by these men. That account shows plainly that while the top hands are a branch of the Miners' Federation they are not satisfied with the existing condition of affairs. They say amount they do not want to sever their connection with the Federation, but will insist that the .Federation gives them justice, and does so promptly. They hold that action must be taken without delay to provide In them with a living wage; otherwise, they will take certain steps themselves. It is difficult for men leading an organization, such as is the Miners Federation, to combat this kind of thing within the organization itself. It does not matter what arguments or promises are placed before these dissatisfied men; they have now reached a point where they are determined to force the issue. They say they are tired of promises about Arbitration Court action or the creation of special t r i bunals. They urge that the cost of living is constantly pressing down upon them, and that ithey positively must have relief. Whether the Miners Federation approves or not, the disquieting fact remains that interested if these men stop work the whole of the coal industry will be held up at once. The effect, of course, will be disastrous to Australia, to say nothing of those coun< tries which are more or less dependent upon the importation of our coal today. I urge that there should be a tribunal created to deal with the situation. I believe there is a feeling that if. an increase in the selling price of coal is authorized a more satisfactory increase in these men's wages can be granted. At present the miners are working under a regulation, gazetted under the W a r Precautions Act as the outcome of a conference' held some time ago. This agreement will not expire u n t i l the end of October. It provides that the miners shall receive so much per ton while the selling price is 17s. 9d. per ton at Newcastle; and no more than' that amount can be charged. heard from fairly reliable sources that, while not more than 17s. ,9d. can be"" charged for coal at Newcastle, yet, if one were to buy coal from a colliery owner at' 17s. 9d., one could sell again immediately, and without handling it , at probably much more than that figure. It has been stated, with respect to Japanese steamers which have been carrying our coal away, that certain men have been buying at 17s. 9d. and selling to foreign buyers - forthwith at 22s. 6d. per ton.. have been supplied with the names of particular persons, who have adopted this practice, but I do not intend to mention them. . If they are receiving 22s. 63. per ton for the coal is it f a ir that the miners, who have to cut it , and the other lower paid employees, whose wages are fixed on a sliding scale according to the selling prioe of the article, should not participate ? I do not say that all the companies are receiving a price higher than that fixed, but coal is being sold by some persons at 22s. 6d. per ton.",47
208,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE,Are the sellers independent of the miners?,48
209,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes . The honourable member or I could go to> the mine and buy coal at 17s. 9d. per .ton, and simply transfer it to somebody else at a higher price.",48
210,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,But do owners get any benefit from that?,48
211,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I do not know under about that ; the honourable member is askto ing me too much. I am urging that the special tribunal shall be clothed with sufficient power to discover all these the things in the public interest - If the stantial House will agree to the appointment of a tribunal comprising three or four reprebunal, sentatives from each side and an indepenall dent chairman, and clothe it with the fullest possible power to investigate every phase of the industry, including the selling price and the profits of the companies, there will be no trouble in the industry. I give that guarantee now. The miners desire a complete investigation; they desire to know where they are, and they say that the time has arrived when the public, too, should be taken into consideration.  under this Bill?",48
212,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,The power is not contained in the Bill . I have,48
213,Mr HILL,PUBLIC SERVICE,Can not we insert the power ?,48
214,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,If I can get the support of a sufficient number of honourable members. I shall move an amendment for the purpose of placing the requisite power in the Bill .,48
215,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PUBLIC SERVICE,Where in the measure is the limitation which prevents the full inquiry for which the honourable member asks?,48
216,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Bill makes no provision for inquiry into profits and selling prices. It deals only with the employer and the employee.,48
217,Sir GRANVILL ERYRIE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Bill . does not say that the tribunal shall . noti n quire into these things, and surely the representatives of the workers wil l see that they are inquired into.",48
218,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If the power is not expressly stated in the Bill , the representatives of the employers on the t r i bunal will object to inquiry into certainmatters, and such an objection will be fatal. Let me read to honourable members what the coal miners are asking, so that the House may understand how far the miners have proceeded along the lines which this Bill proposes to travel- EMPLOYEES' PROPOSED BASIS AND SCOPE OF INQUIRY FO)B COAL TRIBUNAL. Whereas it has heen asserted, by and on .be the minehalf of the eoal mine-owners, that the industry of eoal, shale, and coke producing cannot the present circumstances afford to pay the employees engaged therein wages higher than, those now being paid. And whereas it is claimed, by and on behalf of the employees of the said industry, that said industry can easily alford to pay subincreases in the present rate of wages. We are desirous that a complete inquiry bo held, into tlus matter by a representative triso that justice might be done between parties, and are willing to recommend to the employees, members of our federation, to continue to work upon the present rates of pay pending such inquiry, provided always and subject to the following conditions:(1) That our recommendation to the employers be to continue to work for two months, from the 1st August, 1920. (2) That the Federal Government appoint a Commission of Inquiry with all necessary powers and authorities to conduct a full and comprehensive inquiry into the coal, shale, and coke, industries. (3) That such Commission shall have all the powers of the Supreme Court of Victoria with respect to compelling the attendance of witnesses; the production of books, documents, reports, balance-sheets, papers, and writings; the obtaining and adduction of evidence and the administration of oaths, and all necessary powers and authorities for the purpose of making a full and comprehensive inquiry into all aspects of the coal, shale, and coke industries, and the sale, carriage,, and distribution to the consumer of such products and their industrial by-products. (4) That such Commission shall have full power to inquire into all matters in any wise relating to the wages and conditions of employees in the said industry. (5) That such Commission be composed of representatives of employers, employees, and the general public, and he open to the press and the public. (0) Tliat the Commission be fully empowered to determine the rates of pay, the conditions and hours of work of the employees, the rate of profit to the employers, the question of the proper control of the industry, the price of .products thereof, also the question of commissions, percentages, rebates, and allowances. (7) Tliat the Commission be appointed forthwith and complete its work prior to the 1st October, 1920. (8) That, in the event of the Commission determining that there be an increase in the rates of wages, that such increase be paid as from the 1st August, 1920. (9) The Commission shall consist of three representatives from the employers and three representatives from the employees, with an independent chairman. That nroposal was submitted to the proprietors, who refused to accept it , and that is the reason why the parties - were unable to come to an understanding with the Prime Minister, and is possibly the explanation of the introduction of this measure. The Bill does not give the power to make that full inquiry which is essential.",48
219,Mr MASKS,PUBLIC SERVICE,I differ from the honourable member.,49
220,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Clause powers the Commonwealth consider any matters, conditions, tendencies in any part of the Commonwealth leading, or likely to lead, to 'inMr Charlton. dustrial disputes, or in any way affecting, or likely to affect, industrial peace.""",49
221,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That has nothing to do with the point I am arguing. The Commonwealth Council has only advisory powers and functions. The body that will inquire into the details of the industry is the special tribunal. The Commonwealth Council has only to inquire into and report upon any dispute that may arise in connection with any industry or portion of an industry. If the Council fails to provide a settlement it will report to the Governor General, and a special tribunal will be appointed. The special tribunal cannot be clothed under this Bill as at present worded with the powers which I say are necessary.",49
222,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,What part of the Bill says that the special tribuna l will not have those powers ?,49
223,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,What part of the Bill says that it will have them? The onus of showing that the powers exist rests upon the Government.,49
224,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,Canno t a special t r i bunal deal with any point of inquiry suggested by the Council?,49
225,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Sufficien t power is not given to the special tribuna l to deal with the selling price of coal,"" for instance, ' in other States.",49
226,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes , if the question of price is referred to the special tribunal.",49
227,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No ; the only power to be given to the special tribunal is equivalent to that now enjoyed by the Arbitration Court, and the Court has never dealt with these matters.",49
228,Mr ATKINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Bill contemplates that these matters shall be inquired into.,49
229,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"V e r y often a Bill contemplates a certain thing, but lacks the power to. accomplish it . Have not honourable members heard the argument advanced in this House that constitutional limitations prevent any such inquiry by a Commonwealth tribunal? The only judgment upon the point that I can recollect was given in the MCKay case, - but that does not bear upon the point I am arguing. It was held in that case that a Commonwealth Court could not fix the 7 emselling price of an article. We are notCouncil ""to asking that a special tribunal should have and power to fix the selling price, but we are asking that it shall have power to inquire as to the price which the companies are receiving for the coal, the cost of transport, and other charges, net profits, and as to whether the miners' cannot receive a living wage without increasing the cost of the commodity to the public. We have been arguing that profiteering should be prevented. The miners are anxious to do something in that direction, and for that reason they ask that this power of f u i l inquiry be given. Apart from the case of the coal miners, I wish to give the House an additional reason why greater power should be provided in this Bill than in any previous legislation to inquire extensively into matters pertaining to industrial unrest. The position today is different from what it was a few years ago. In almost every industry there is a closer combination of employers. We may read in the papers almost every day of companies having been reconstructed, but not by putting additional capital into the concern. They had carried so much money to reserves during the war that now, finding that legislation in the direction of regulating wages is against them, they are nominally increasing the'x capital by giving to their existing shareholders so many additional shares for each share now held by them. Unless a tribunal has power to inquire full y into all these things, the employers will show that a particular industry cannot afford to pay more than the present wages, because the profits are only 6, 7, or 8 per cent. They will not say, and the tribunal will not be able to discover, that that profit is reckoned on inflated or watered capital, and the result of an in quiry, therefore, will be that the industry cannot afford to pay more than a certain wage, because shareholders are entitled to a fair return on the capital invested.",49
230,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"A very wide power is conferred in the last portion of the definition of "" industrial matters.""",50
231,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The power contained in that definition is not wide enough to cover the points upon which I am arguing. It reads"" Industrial matters"" includes all matters relating to work, pay, wages, reward, hours, privileges, rights, or duties of employers or employees, or the mode, terms and conditions of employment or non-employment; and in particular, but without limiting the general scope of this definition, includes all matters pertaining to the relations of employers and employees, and the employment, preferential employment, dismissal, or non-employment of any particular persons, or of persons of any particular sex or age, or being or not being members of any organization, association, or body, and any claim arising under an industrial agreement"", and includes all questions of what is fair and right in relation to any industrial matter having regard to the interests of the persons immediately concerned and of society as a whole. That definition applies entirely to an in dustrial matter, but it gives no scope to deal with the prices charged for an article after it leaves the producing industry. That is the point. The term "" industry "" is held to apply only to the particular in dustry in which the dispute has occurred; it does not extend beyond the direct employer and employee. I have already pointed out that in connection with mining, in particular, the position is changed; we cannot deal with the employer and employees alone, because the shipping people have got control of most of the mines, ..and can regulate wages and make handsome profits out of freight, and so forth. This .definition is not broad enough to touch that position. If honourable members think that my argument is a fair one, they ought to meet me in Committee by accepting an amendment, which would go far to settling the trouble. If the coal miners think that they will be granted an inquiry to cover all the ramifications of the trade throughout Australia, so as to ascertain its exact position, there will be no trouble, which is likely only because the belief is that such an inquiry will not be held. If the Prime Minister would say now that he will make some provision of the kind, he would relieve the tension in the coal industry.  under the Arbitration Act?",50
232,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,No .,50
233,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Judge has the power, but not the parties to the dispute.",50
234,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Prime M in ister is not present; but I suggest that some of his colleagues might convey to the right honourable gentleman the ideas I have expressed. I go so far as to say that, in regard to trade secrets, profits, and so forth , if there were any objections to the proceedings being made public, they might be discussed in camera in the presence of the representatives of the men. That is another idea which, if carried out, will go a long way towards a settlement.",50
235,Mr MAHONY,PUBLIC SERVICE,-The special tribunal may sit in private.,51
236,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Of course. Under the New South Wales Arbitration Act, the Judge could ""hear evidence as to the selling prices, and so forth, in camera for his own satisfaction; but there is no such power in relation to Inter-State disputes.",51
237,Mr RILEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,There was a representative from each side present.,51
238,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is so. The honourable member is familiar with these matters, having been a member of Wages Boards for a considerable time. I myself have appeared on many occasions to advocate miners' cases before the Court, and we took such action as I have described. Industrial organizations, after nearly nineteen years' experience of arbitration, will not accept any proposal which does not afford them the fullest protection, and permit investigation of every phase of the industry concerned, especially in view of the events of the last few years, during which exorbitant profits have been made, and certain people have become exceptionally wealthy. The miners contend that the time has arrived when their industry should be put on a proper and fair footing. If the miners are entitled to an increase of Wages, it does not follow that the extra tost should be placed on the general public. If the House takes no notice of tjie miners' demands, we shall probably find coal going up in price, and the miners getting so much more in wages. Their contention is, however, that in ,this industry we ought to get back to normal conditions, and if they are entitled to more remuneration, with the present prices, they ought to have it. in any case, coal here is the cheapest in the world today.",51
239,Mr WEST,PUBLIC SERVICE,"At the pit's mouth. , Mr Charlton - No; free on (board-; the honourable member is speaking of the olden days. The idea now is to follow the coal from the pit's mouth to its destination, because, as i have said, the shipping people are interested in the mines. It is not a matter of dealing with the colliery proprietors only, but also .with the shipping people, who are easily making two profits.",51
240,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,That would protect l!he public as well as the workmen.,51
241,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Exactly ; that is their idea. The men thought that such, an inquiry was to be agreed to, and I think that the Prime Minister himself was under the same impression. At the first conference, in Sydney, the proprietors raised no objection to it;, from what I have been informed by miners' representatives, and from other quarters, they tacitly agreed to the idea; and it was only when they cameto Melbourne that they changed"" their views. Now it appears they are prepared to accept; and why should they do .that if the results are going: to he what some honourable members/ think? It is because they know that the proposal does not give the power that the men think, but that the inquiry is confined to Newcastle.",51
242,Mr ROBERT COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"What was the pre^ war price at the pit's mouth? . Mr Charlton.^Speaking subject to correction, I think it was 12s. when the tribunal sat. We are all interested in the continuity of employment, arid dev sire no upheaval at the present moment ; we desire to increase production, so that we may be able to carry the burden of the war. If that be so, surely in a matter of this kind we can. meet the men ? What is the good of complaining about the money that the men earn? The whole matter will depend on the tribunal, which may be relied on to do nothing wrong or unjust. There will be three representatives from each side, and, if they fail to agree on a chairman, the Executive will appoint one; and what could be fairer? Why rush a measure through that does not provide the proper machinery when we know what must happen if we do not give the power to hold a thorough investigation ?",51
243,Sir GRANVILLE RYREE,PUBLIC SERVICE,The honourable member may move an amendment in Committee.,51
244,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That is my intention; but the trouble is that I may be closured before we Teach it. .Suppose that a long discussion takes place on a previous amendment, and the time air lowed for that portion of the Bill elapses, I shall not be able to submit my amendment or argue my case. Mr MtAixwELi. - If you foreshadow your amendment it might be accepted. Mr T.UDOE. - Only Government amendments are put under the standing order.",51
245,Mr ATKINSO N,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Government will accept an amendment if it is a reasonable one.,52
246,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I see that the House appreciates the position that I am taking up. This is important legislation in the face of a crisis we desire to avert. In view of the likelihood that 1 may not . be able to place my amendment before the Committee, I am endeavouring to give honourable members now some idea of what is in my mind, and in the minds of the industrial leaders outside.",52
247,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Prime Minister ought to be present to hear all this.,52
248,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If the Prime Minister were present, he might agree to something like what I have put forward, and it is unfortunate for me that he is not, because it is of the greatest importance to the community that something should be done in this direction; it would minimize to a very large extent the objections to the Bill . The amendment I should propose in Committee would be to the effect that, so far as the special tribunal is concerned, it should be empowered to inquire exhaustively into every phase of coal mining or other in dustry, from the production of the commodity to its final destination. My object is to give the fullest possible scope of inquiry in regard to profits, selling price, and so for t h ; and, as I have said, if there is any strong objection to publicity, these matters may be taken in camera. I am prepared to go so far as that in order to avert trouble. Nobody knows better than the Treasurer (S ir Joseph Cook) that, in the mining industry, once there is unrest, there is likely to be a breakaway in spite of the officials. There are so many sections of the industry that, if one of them make a .break the trouble is on. The suggestions I have made would materially help the official leaders of the miners, and, in my opinion, enable them to settle the business without any great difficulty.",52
249,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) says that if we do those things we are making a vicious attack on unionism.,52
250,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,The honourable member is under a misapprehension.,52
251,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable"" member for Barrier (Mr Considine) has handed me a proposal drafted to the effect that a Royal Commission be appointed to investigate and report on the conditions in the mining industry at Broken Hill , more particularly in regard to the cost of production, wages, hours and other conditions of ""employees, the health of those engaged, selling prices, profits arising from the industry, and their methods of distribution. These are just the matters that the miners desire to have investigated by a tribunal, and no tribunal without such powers will give satisfaction. Probably very few members will agree with me when I say that the time has arrived when we should, as far as possible, go in for conciliation only. This measure goes a long way in that direction, and I here suggest that it would be better if penalties, were abolished. The whole of my experience shows that with a round-table conference more can be done than by any other means; do. away with penalties and leave the parties to come together and effect a settlement.",52
252,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,We are. getting back to 'the conditions of thirty years ago!,52
253,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It is admitted that we cannot possibly prevent strikes and lockouts-that all we can do is to hope to minimize them. No legislation will prevent either of these actions. I say, candidly, that for years, as an in dustrialist, I have. been an advocate of machinery to deal with disputes as they arise in preference to any system leading to delay. If a dispute arises in the mining industry, for instance, and an immediate settlement is not arrived at, the trouble will magnify, union and grow like a fire. Before I entered politics I worked in a colliery, and during the whole time. I was there we had no strikes. That was beoause the proprietor, Mr Duncan MCGeachie, told me that if any trouble seemed likely I , as the miners' representative, should see him ; and when trouble did arise, two or three representatives of the men met the management, and we never failed to effect a settlement', although we had,, during my employment there, as' many ap fifty matters requiring adjustment.",52
254,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I had similar experience at Lithgow during the whole of the time. I .was there, but that method of settling disputes is now regarded as old-fashioned.",53
255,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The parties are . brought together, and an endeavour is made to settle a dispute. If they fail , then a tribunal is created to deal with it. But we want that tribunal to be clothed with the fullest powers to sift all that is necessary for the settlement of a dispute.",53
256,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The power to inquire into profits and costs of distribution could not be exercised by a local body, - which may readily settle a local dispute.",53
257,Mr CHARLTON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"It is true that the bigger questions which affect the whole of an industry, and which have an Inter-State character, can only be dealt with by a special tribunal. However, I ask the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) to make a declaration before the week is out as to whether machinery will be set up to enable the tribunal dealing with the coalminers' dispute to have the fullest possible power to make such an exhaustive inquiry as may serve the purpose of preventing f u t u r e trouble.",53
258,Mr BLAKELE Y,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Dariing ) [8.46] Arbitration in many phases has been tried in Australia; but, unfortunately, the attempts to brincr about industrial peace by legislation introduced by Governments representative of the employing classes rather than of the employees, have not had the tendency to achieve the desired result. The primary object of the coercion Acts of New South Wales, and ' similar measures passed in other States, has been a regard for the interests of the employers. However, the force of public opinion and the growing strength of the unions have gradually compelled the various Administrations to recognise the necessity for industrial harmony. have had a series of disastrous strikes in Australia during the last six years, such - as the general strike of 1917, the seamen's strike, and others, and although for the most part the losses have been borne by the workers, the nation's interests have been most adversely affected. When in troducing this Bill the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) said that it must fail with out the hearty co-operation of labour; but when we ask, first of all , that the trade unionists should be given an opportunity of discussing the measure and an exactly making suggestions, we are told that this is an urgent measure, and that a conference, in order to improve the Bill , could not possibly be called at this stage.",53
259,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,Does the honourable member seriously think that there is a hope of getting anything like substantial unanimity outside on a Bill of this kind?,53
260,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"Yes . Por the last nine months the Government have promised repeate'dly that they would call a conference, but they have not yet got that conference together.",53
261,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,The Prime Minister has tried hard to get a conference.,53
262,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The Australian Workers Union is ready, and I believe that most of the trades and ""labour councils are - willing to attend such a conference. A f t e r all , the trade unionists will be called upon to bear the brunt of any trouble. No one goes on strike merely for the f u n of the thing. There are people today who foolishly say that the Broken Hill workers, who have not enough clothes on their back or sufficient food to give them proper nourishment, had no right to go on strike. Do these people think that these unfortunate workers of Broken Hill are enjoying a strike which has extended over a period of fourteen months? It is only when the workers are driven to it that they take this action; they do not strike for choice. When the Prime Minister said that without the hearty co-operation of Labour the Bill could not succeed, he uttered a truth. If the Australian Workers Union, the coal miners, the transport workers, or the workers of other organizations are not prepared to accept this Industrial Peace Bill , that will be the end of the measure. ",53
263,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,S i m p l y because We the workers are in the position they hold today. ,53
264,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member may interpret the truth as a threat; that is his own lookout. I am merely giving utterance to a fact. If the honourable member knows anything of the industrial world he must recognise the truth of what I am saying. The Government, by allowdng not more than twenty four hours for the consideration of a measure such as this, are not giving the representatives of the workers the opportunit y of discussing the proposal or of helping them.",53
265,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,That is not a correct statement. W it h in the next fortnight honourable members can devote forty-eight hours to the Bill .,54
266,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"I have worked out the time, and a very optimistic estimate of the time which will be occupied in discussing this Bill is twenty-four and a half hours. But even if we should take foTty hours, I am extremely doubtful whether at the end of-that period there would not still be a good deal to be said.",54
267,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE,The House has already decided that point.,54
268,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"If the Prime M in ister expects the hearty co-operation of the representatives of Labour in this House, he is going a peculiar way about getting it . If the industrial leaders of Australia attack this Bill , as no doubt many of them will do in its present stage, it will have so bad an effect upon t i e measure that it will never do effective work as an Act, except in its application to small industries. I hope that that is not the sole desire of the Government. I hope that they are sincere in their endeavour to bring about true industrial peace. Their first effort in this direction apparently is an extraordinary document to set up four separate tribunals, council?, boards, or committees without giving those concerned the opportunity of discussing the proposal. hardly been a Bill introduced in this House since 1917 affecting the rights of employers and vested interests in regard to which those concerned have not been consulted. In 1917 the Union met with due solemnity and decided that the Conciliation and A r b i tration Act should be amended. fact, they drafted a Bill for the purpose, and forwarded it to the Government. That was the first attempt made to get r i d of Mr Justice Higgins, but apparently because of the outcry of honourable members on this side of the House the thing was too hot to hold, and now, instead of brutally saying to Mr . Justice Higgins, "" We are dissolving your Court and superseding your Act by another measure. Go back to the High Court; your job as President of the A r b i tration Court is abolished ""-instea d of following that course a more roundabout method is adopted. Of course, the Prime Minister says very naively that this Bill will merely supplement the Arbitration Court; but I venture to say that immediately an award of that Court is superseded by a decision of a council or tribunal, we shall have the spectacle of an indignant President of the Arbitration Court wanting to know what his position is. In the past four years Mr Justice Higgins has stood a good deal more than most men would have stood, and I can quite conceive what he would think of his position if a tribunal or council appointed with a Government nominee as chairman, and with representatives of organizations on it , gave a decision superseding an award made by the Court a few months previously. Of course, the President of the Court would resign, and thus all the strategy and planning of the past f o ur years to get r i d of his presence in the industrial arena will succeed. In 1917, resolutions poured in from all parts of Australia-fro m Chambers of Commerce, Chambers of Manufactures, farmers and settlers' organizations, Employers' Federations, and so forth-askin g for the i m mediate removal of Mr Justice Higgins from the Arbitratio n Court, and in this House the honourable member for Barker (Mr Livingston) and the then honourable member for Moreton (Mr Sinclair) submitted questions antagonistic to that Justice. As a consequence, honourable memThere has bers of the Opposition were obliged to take a course to counteract this agitation, and extracted the promise that the Conciliation and Arbitration A ct would be amended. During the last four years we Pastoralists have moved in this direction no less than four or five times. I myself moved the adjournment of the House twice to deal In with the matter, and in 1918, because of a High Court judgment which prevented the Arbitration Court from enforcing its awards, we asked the Prime Minister to amend the Act. It was not done. We also asked that the President of the Court should be given the power to compel the payment of fines, but the National Government would not give us that amendment. We were promised on several occasions by the Prime Minister that the Act would be amended, and on one or two occasions by the then Acting Prima Minister (Mr W at t ) . But the promise has not been fulfilled . Apparently the Government did not intend to carry out its promises. In his second-reading speech upon this Bill the Prime Minister said that the Arbitration Court was too costly and so cumbersome and slow that it might be regarded as having completed its life's work. So far as he wa3 concerned, he said that he could not give it any help. He mentioned that forty two unions are now awaiting the hearing of their claims. Whose faul t is it? It is the faul t of the Government. When I moved the adjournment of the House a few months ago on this very question of congesvion in the Arbitration Court we were promised by the Acting Attorney General (Mr Groom) that a Deputy President of the Court would be appointed. Mr Justice Starke was appointed to the Court, and has heard a couple of cases; but there is only he and the Presi^ dent to transact the business, Mr Justice Powers having gone away. Justices cannot hear all the cases that have been listed, and the Government has done nothing to give thenE assistance, although some of the cases have been awaiting a hearing for nine months. Prime Minister says that the machinery of the Court is too cumbersome, and will not work; yet under this Bill only the same powers are given as can be exercised under the existing Act ; no new power is conferred.",54
269,Mr MAXWELL,PUBLIC SERVICE,To what powers do you refer?,55
270,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,I aimspeaking of the powers conferred by virtue of the definition of industrial matters.,55
271,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE,The problem is so much one of powers- .as of facilities.,55
272,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The definition in the Bill reads as follows: ""Industrial matters"" includes all matters relating to work, pay, wages, reward, hours, privileges, rights, or duties ofemployers or employees, or the mode, terms and conditions of employment or non-employment; and in particular, but without limiting the general scope of this definition, includes all matters pertaining to the relations of employers and employees, and the employment, preferential employment, dismissal, or non-employment of any particular persons, or of persons of any particular sex or age, or being or not being members of any organization, association, or body, and any claim arising under an industrial agreement, and includes all questions of what is fair and right in relation to any industrial matter having regard to the interests of the persons immediately concerned and of society as a whole. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) and the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) say that that definition! is proof positive that everything necessary is provided to enable costs of production, selling prices, and similar necessary information to be obtained. As a matter of fact, it has been oopied word for word,, and comma for comma from the existing Act , and according to the H i gh Court there is not now the power to do w h at ' is necessary, although those honourable members claim that it can be done under the Industrial Peace Bill . While the Government were copying frdm the existing arbitration legislation, they might well have copied those provisions which provide for the representation of organizations. They should not hav© provided a loop-hole for bogus organizations to get in and crowd Those two out bond fide organizations. Bogus organizations are constantly springing up in this country. The Leader of the Opposition mentioned some of them. They are the tools of the employing class. There The was the Machine Shearers Un|ion, which was organized, subsidized, and carried on by the pastoralists in order to break up the Australian Workers U n i o n ; and it failed signally. Thenthere was Packer's Union here, and a bogus unjion connected with the Brisbane tramways- Scab organizations are even now in existence in some parts of Australia. We had members of this Chamber and of the Senate - ex-Labou r mem--goin g round organizing a scab union of waterside workers. There are scab unions in New South not Wales today, and there were recently scab unions in Western Australia. Under the Bill these organizations, though patently subsidized and kept going by the employers, may get preference over bond fide organizations. It is not necessary even to create a bogus organization to crowd out the bona fide organization. It is possible for the Government, through its nominee, the Chairman, to say who shall be called. At the present time there is a strike in the pastoral in dustry, and under the Bill some of the tools of the pastoralists could be called before the tribunal. Of course, the workers would not acknowledge the decisions of the tribunal; but it is a fact that the Australian Workers Union could be disregarded by the t r i bunal, and unrepresentative persons allowed to pretend to speak for the in dustry.",55
273,Mr CONSIDINE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"That would not shear, the sheep.",56
274,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"No ; and it should not be allowed. H a d the arbitration law been amended as was promised on half-adozen. occasions by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and by Mr Watt, when Acting Prime Minister, the present strike would not be in progress. My organization, the Australian Workers Union, is fighting-and will win, because it is fighting for a dear principle-to secure a forty-four hours' week. The pastoralists of Victoria, of Southern Biverina, which is a fair l y big slice of New South Wales, and those of West Darling, and of South Australia, have agreed to the forty-four hours' week, with Queensland rates of pay-£ 2 per 100, and so on; but 'a few of the pastoralists of New South Wales- I should say less than 30 per cent, of all the pastoralists affected by the ' new conditions-hav e allowed themselves to be used by the Chambers of Commerce and Manufactures and the vested interests generally, and are putting up a fight. However, there will be no shearing upon conditions other than those laid' down by the Australian Workers'Union , to which practically the whole pastoral industry of Australia has agreed. The Bill provides for councils, tribunals, and Boards. There is to be the Commonwealth Council, consisting of three representatives of the employers and three representatives of the employees, who will not necessarily represent organizations. It is necessary that that should be made clear. I intend to move in Committee that no person shall be allowed to go before these bodies unless representing an organization. There is no industry in Australia that is not covered now by a bond fide organization. To allow the ""rag-tag "" of the industrial world to pretend to represent the trade unionists, the genuine workers, will not tend to industrial peace. The chairman of the Commonwealth Council is to be appointed by the Government. I am not certain that that is a good thing, though if the Labour party were-in power I would say that the provision was a sound one. I am quite frank in that statement. The ' worker creates all wealth, and, therefore, should have the greatest say as to its disposition. Again, there are district councils, to be nominated by the Government, and to consist of an equal number of employers and employees; on which, again, persons who do not represent organizations may have seats. That is not proper. Only representatives of bond fide organizations should be appointed. Then there are the special tribunals, the chairmen of which are to be elected by the parties if they can agree, failing which, the Government is to make the appointments. I think that the provision relating to the appointment of the chairman of a special tribunal should apply also to the appointment of the chairmen of the Commonwealth Council and of district councils. If it is a good enough provision for the special tribunals which are to be created to meet crises, it is a good enough provision for the other two bodies. Then there are to be local Boards, whose chairmen are to be appointed ""as prescribed."" I object, as I have done before, to legislating by prescription, or regulation. To provide that the Govern orGeneral in Council may prescribe the manner of appointing the chairmen of local Boards is practically to provide that the Government may nominate them. A local Board is to consist of its chairman, and an employer and an employee, and here again there need be no representation of organizations. It is an extraordinary coincidence that the scheme of this Bill-the various bodies to be created were given different names-wa s recently given publicity by a body calling itself the "" People's Federation of Returned Soldiers and Citizens,"" of which  whether it is a wing of the National party, though from his speeches I should think that it is.",56
275,Mr JOWETT,PUBLIC SERVICE,How many wings has the Nationalist party got?,56
276,Mr BLAKELEY,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The honourable member belongs to one of them. So interesting is the coincidence, that I  posals :PEOPLE'S FEDERATION OF RETURNED SOLDIERS AND CITIZENS.

Dear Sir, Further to our previous correspondence on the subject of the campaign to normalize industry and eliminate industrial turmoil, I desire to draw your attention to a resolution of the executive at their meeting on 20th April. "" That the members of the Federal and State Parliament in sympathy with the campaign be elected to the Parliamentary Committee, and that, the chairman be requested to convene a meeting of the Parliamentary Committee immediately."" The meeting referred to will be held in the Masonic Hall on Tuesday, 2,5th May, at 11.15 a.m., and I would like you to let me know whether you will attend, so that arrangements may be made for your accommodation. At the meeting the legislative aspect of the campaign will be considered. .We are relying upon you to play a leading part .in this urgent public campaign to normalize industry and eliminate industrial unrest. Please see attached. People's Federation of Returned Soldiers I am wondering just where this idea came from. I am wondering whether, in May last, this wing of the National was given a hint to get busy and do some propaganda work, just as in the case of the Farmers and Settlers Association, who Mr Blakeley. were told to get busy in 1917 in order to get rid of Mr Justice Higgins. The proposition set forth in the document emanating from the People's Federation of Returned Soldiers and Citizens is, with merely a series of changes of names, a replica of the Bill ; or, perhaps, I should say that the Bill is, with those same changes, a replica of the provisions contained in the document. For example, the statement refers to the Supreme Court; the Bill speaks of a Commonwealth Council. The statement alludes to State Courts; the Bill speaks of District Councils. In the document there 13 reference to Justices; the Bill mentions Local Boards. In the former there is reference to a Court of Industrial Review; whereas the Bill refers to special tribunals. The coincidence right through is altogether extraordinary.",56
277,Mr JOWETT,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"This kind of thing is and Citizens, much easier than exposing the faults of M . P . PlMENTEL, the Bill. President.",57
278,Mr BLAKELEY,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,This is portion of Citizens. a campaign which has been conducted for four years with the intrntion of getting rid of Mr Justice Higgin . And c the campaign will succeed. I venture to say that within four months Mr Justice Higgins will not be President of the Arbitration Court.,57
279,Mr JOWETT,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,You must have got some Resolution. inside information.,57
280,Mr BLAKELEY,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"That may be «>. The Government have started out with a bludgeon to enforce industrial peace, whether the workers want it or not. The industrialists have not been consulted. No organization has been consulted regarding the provisions of the Bill. ""Whether it is the intention of the Government to take action in that direction, I cannot say. I know that at Bendigo, some seven or eight months ago, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) stated that it was his intention to call an industrial conferYours faithfully, ence immediately. It has not yet been called. While the Prime Minister will not and Citizens, call a conference of industrialists only, M. P. PIMENTEL, he states that when, such a conference President. has been called, if those attending it agree upon suggestions, he will immediately amend the Bill in order to suit the wishes party of the representatives gathered there. I wonder whether that promise is not on a par with the many promises made by the Prime Minister during the past three years, particularly in regard to amending the Arbitration Act in order to provide the Court with greater powers, and to give unions better facilities for having their cases heard. I am not sure that this Bill will do as the Prime Minister seeks to provide. I can see two bunals overlapping, in respect of a particular industry, where the lines of demarcation may be very hard to define. Unless the Government are prepared to accept suggestions from the unions, and from honourable members on this side, how can they hope to bring about that industrial harmony so much desired, not only by the workers, but by the whole of the people? It is an effort worthwhile to achieve that harmony; but if it is sought by means of the guillotine, by means of curt refusals to permit consideration of the Government's projects by those who vvill be most affected thereby, how can the Government expect to bring about indust r i a l harmony? They will never so achieve it. Unless the Government are prepared to listen to suggestions, this Bill will not be worth the paper on which it is printed. Industrial peace cannot be secured unless the Government are prepared to listen to the views of the organizations. Government have refused to do so. Therefore, this measure will go the way of those other Bills which have been passed, not in the interests of the workers, but of certain other people in the community. Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN Monaro) [9.26] - I cannot understand the opposition displayed to this measure. The debate, so far, has not been a criticism of the Bill itself, but a threat, or a warning, of what may happen. It has been a relation of what the Government may do in the direction of making appointments of certain biased men. If tribunals are to be appointed to settle industrial troubles, the proper authorities for bringing these bodies together are the Government, being the chosen representatives of the people themselves. title of this Bill might well be, "" AB ill for an Act to prevent industrial trouble."" Prevention is better than cure. ""We should do all that is possible to aid arbitration.",57
281,Mr BLAKELEY,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,Arbitratio n has been killed by your Government.,58
282,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,How ?,58
283,Mr BLAKELEY,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,Forty-tw o cases are now awaiting hearing by the Arbitration Court.,58
284,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"I agree that those cases should not be waiting, that there should not be such congestion; t r i - but it should not be forgotten that we have been passing through abnormal times.",58
285,Mr BLAKELEY,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,You have plenty of Judges.,58
286,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"That may be so, but what encouragement is there when we listen to criticism of judgments and awards by the Arbitration Court? Mr Justice Higgins may give a decision one way, and one side criticises it ; and, when his award goes the other way, it is abused from ' the other side. There has been a deal of innuendo and straight-out accusation to the effect that an organized effort is being made to get rid of Mr Justice Higgins. I have never heard of any attempt in that direction. It appears to me to be a very stupid thing for any honourable member to endeavour to prove that a section of the community is trying to get r i d of a Judge because that section is opposed to his work in the Arbitration Court. The Mr BLAKELEY - If the Standing Orders will permit, I wil l bet you that Mr Justice Higgins will not be a Judge of the Arbitration Court - four months hence.",58
287,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"It is apparent that the honourable member must have some private information. The (Eden- men who ought to cavil at this Bill are agitators who get their living by promoting strikes. I hope and believe we have none of those 'gentry in this House. If there are such, however, they have every right to criticise the Government for introducing a measure.of this kind.",58
288,Mr BRENNAN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,Where are these funny individuals ? I have never yet seen any of these funny men who promote strikes.,58
289,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"Then the honourable member could never have looked into a mirror. I was surprised The at a statement by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor)-who , however, does make wild statements at times-to the effect that some thousands of pounds have been spent by an organization in securing an Arbitration Court award",58
290,Mr TUDOR,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,It cost the Bootmakers Union £5.000 to get its award from the Arbitration Court.,58
291,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"That is a strong argument in favour of this Bill . When the system of arbitration was in augurated it was not proposed that there should be brought into activity an army of lawyers. It had been considered that the arbitration process would be conducted around a table, directly between representatives of employers and employees. I do not think all the employees today are anxious for strikes and industrial trouble generally; nor are the employers. If the two parties were permitted to come together and agitators were left out, they would agree upon terms in nineteen out of twenty cases. It is generally recognised today that the worker is entitled to high wages; and we know full well that the Australian worker earns them. Employers are commencing to realise that it is not the amount of wages, so much as the work done in return, that matters. They are content to pay good wages if they receive good value, and if men in most occupations are left alone they will give good value. High wages are no detriment to industry. The damage is done by the go-slow policy, and the whisoerings of walking delegates, who say to the workers, "" You have matters in your own hands; you need not work hard unless you choose."" I have looked at this measure closely, and I am very interested in it , because I deny that the men who are striving to secure industrial peace and to provide good conditions of living for the workers are all on one side of the House. I know of men on this side of the House who are willing to go just as far as honourable members opposite to insure that the workers have a fair deal. If honourable members were to visit the station of the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) they would find all his employees contented. Men. of his type have a strong sympathy with the working man. I appeal to honourable members opposite not to be continually creating class prejudices, and persisting in the doctrine that, because a man employs labour, he has no sympathy with the labourer. I employ labour, but, having worked strenuously myself, I have a high regard for the Australian working man. Most employers realise nowadays that it does not matter how much they pav in wages so long as they get proportionate value. I ask the practical men on the Opposition side to assist the Government in making this measure perfect.",59
292,Mr MAHONY,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"We offered them, this morning, a conference with the trade unionists of Australia, and they turned it down.",59
293,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"It seems to me that a conference with either trade unionists or employers would not be as effective as a round-table gathering of the parties at which each could ascertain the other's views. We desire employer and employee to realise that capital and labour must work hand in hand if the country is to be successfully developed. The harm is done by those who seek to sow seeds of dissension, and they are not all on the side of the employees. Some employers are now reaping the harvest of their old Conservative ideas. I am strongly in favour of this Bill , because I think it represents a step in the right direction. It is an honest attempt to bring capital and labour together. If it is followed up by a consultation with men who desire to .put oil, and not vinegar, in the industrial machinery, good will result. It does not matter who appoints the chairman or umpire. If the Government appoint an official who is unfair, he will jolly soon be brought to book. Thank God in this country we get little of that "" boss-ism"" that is rampant in other countries. Government officials in Australia have a pretty good record, and it has always been a pleasure to me, as a member of Parliament, to find Public Service officials who will stand up to Ministers, and even to crowds, in order to do the thing they consider right. Many of the big public officials in this country are a credit to it ; we ought to be proud of them, and this House ought to be chary of traducing their characters, even by innuendo. We should avoid, also, any incentive to industrial strife. Honourable members talk about the machinery of this measure overlapping existing machinery; even if there were double and treble overlapping, would that not be better than the wretched state of affairs that exists at Broken Hill today?",59
294,Mr BLAKELEY,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,Do not lose sight of the fact that forty-two unions are waiting to have their cases heard by the' A r b i tration Court.,59
295,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"I agree that the Government ought to be taken to task over that matter. There are plenty of Judges to do that work, and it ought to be done at once. The Government take a big responsibility when they delay making adequate provision for the settlement of industrial strife, because any one of these unions could, by a strike, upset the commercial life of the community. The Bill will have my strongest support, and I apneal to honourable members not to regard it in a party spirit. Its purpose is to prevent industrial strife and to establish certain and settled conditions. The employee requires good wages and a certainty of working full time, but the capitalist also requires settled conditions. The surest way to meet those requirements is to give reasonable security against the possibility of industrial, disturbance. I appeal to honourable members to make an earnest effort to seriously consider the proposal and put forward any amendments that will tend to improve the measure. I shall be glad to vote with honourable members who propose anything that will mean better conditions for the man who toils, because, in the past, we have not given him the consideration to which he is entitled. To-day he is demanding it ; let us give it to him without strife. I believe this Bill will tend in that direction, and for that reason it will have my support.",59
296,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"Hindmarsh) [ 9 . 4 0 ] : regret the circumstances in which this B was introduced; it resembles very much an infan t strangled at its birth . There was some hope of a successful outcome for it if the Government had proved their willingness to meet that body of the community which is directly concerned in the merits and - demerits of this legislation. But the door was practically slammed in the face of the organized forces of labour, and it will be found that they will show great reluctance'to knock again. If the Government had a sincere desire to overcome the difficulties that confront us in the industrial sphere, they would have been only too pleased to avail themselves of the opportunity afforded them here this afternoon. I have been in consultation with leading representatives of organized labour in Melbourne, and I can verify the statement of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), that up t ill this afternoon they had rather an open mind as to the possibilities of this Bill , although they recognised that its terms are very vague and indefinite, and will require considerable amendment before they will he satisfactory to the great forces of labour. A f t e r the experience of this afternoon, however, I am afraid there will exist an atmosphere of suspicion which will render the success of the Bill almost impossible. I have an honest and sincere desire to discover some solution for the very perplexing problem of industrial unrest, but I recognise that the cause of the trouble is . deeply rooted in the present economic ' system. Until such time as we adopt a system which will do greater justice to all parties, and observe the principles of equity to a greater extent than does the present system, and which will prevent avarice and greed takingadvantage of the misfortune of the humbler sections of society, we shall not achieve . that social and economic condition that we are so desirous of inaugur Sting. Organized labour must not be regarded as simply a decreasingly important adjunct to the industrial machine, but as a council among councils, with rights and responsibilities. This afternoon, however, there was, practically, an intimation from the Government that it did not recognise that organized labour is entitled to claim any voice in respect to its responsibilities and rights. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin - I Chapman) has said that the promotion of ill strikes is largely attributable to the agitator. If that is the impression of the honourable member, he certainly does not do credit to the working classes. I have been closely connected with industrial organizations since it has been my duty, as a unit of the working classes, to have to shoulder the responsibilities of providing for myself and later those dependent upon me; and I have recognised that the worker is not always prepared to accept the dictum of those who may be regarded, or spoken of, as alleged agitators. Very often the worker is apt to take rather a conservative view, and is very careful in taking any forward steps In the organization to which I happen to belong, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, before we can take the extreme step which requires the leaving of employment, it is necessary to have a secret ballot, so that the rank and file may be able, without anv influence of an undue character, to voice their opinions; and that principle is observed in the maiority of industrial organizations. Industrial unrest is not the consequence of the agitation, or-shal l I say ?-the action of what are regarded as alleged-irrespon sible individuals, but the consequence of a feeling within the heart and mind of the wovker that he 13 subject to conditions that are unjustWe know what the circumstances and conditions of the working classes have been throughout the ages; and those classes recognise that there has been a tightening of the economic conditions under which they labour. They wish to befree of the conditions which today are preventing them from enjoying the higher opportunities and privileges of life. Are there those - who still think that the working man cannot appreciate the good things of life as well as can any other person? He does not, however, have the opportunity, nor do his wife and dependants, to avail themselves of these good things. are among the causes of industrial unrest. It is not because a few of advanced ideas speak to a 'body of men and get them to follow blindly; it is because the working classes realiziei that they have been, and are, subject to great imposition-that they are the unfortunate victims of the greed and avarice of the financial and commercial institutions of this and other countries-that they are dissatisfied. As to the Bill . I would not like to say there are not some redeeming features in it , but its indefinite nature makes it unacceptable to any honourable member on this side, without amendments, to amply protect organized labour.",60
297,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,What amendments do you desire?,61
298,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"A number has been suggested in the course of the discussion In my opinion, the appointment of the chairmen of the various tribunals, councils, and Boards should be free from any political influence; but the Bill practically gives to the Government the power to select those who are to be the judges in the cases that come forward. We need not endeavour to fool ourselves; we must know well that there are two factions in every community, more materially concerned in legislation of this nature .; there are those who represent the financial and commercial interests, and there are those who represent the workers.",61
299,Mr ATKINSON,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,They are not sarily enemies.,61
300,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"The r e is a growing feeling that their interests are .diametrically opposed-and' it will require every provision of candour on the part of employers, to bridge that difficulty that has been - created. In the political life of the country, there are the representatives of the working classes, the great forces of organized labour, and there are those who are O'pposed to Labour, and the latter are those who at the present time hold the reins of administration in this country-the Government of today. I believe there are men on both sides of the House who have a desire to honourably find a way out of our industrial difficulties; but I feel that, consciously or unconsciously, the appointments made by these persons will give one side an advantage over the other. - That being so, the Bill in this respect is These not acceptable to the forces of organized - labour.",61
301,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,Who should make the appointments?,61
302,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,It would not do any harm if such important appointments were made by the people-if these chairmen were elected jusit as we are elected to this House.,61
303,Mr JOWETT,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"This Government claims to represen'- the people, because it is the Government in office.",61
304,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"If the members of the Country party had done what might have been reasonably ex,pected of them, the present Government would not now be in a position to claim that they represent anything like the opinions of the people of the country.",61
305,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,Would you - have trusted their successors to make the appointments ?,61
306,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"F r o m what we have seen since the inception of this particular Parliament, I am afraid that the Country party is almost impossible, and - that we on this side, and those whom we represent, can look for little from them, so far as concerns the conservation and preservation of the interests of the working classes.",61
307,Mr ROBERT COOK,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,That is onjly your opinion.,61
308,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"It is not only my opinion, but the opinion of the great bulk of the community whom we represent; necesindeed, it almost appears as if there is some honourable understanjding between the Government and the Country party when it comes to a vital issue.",61
309,Mr JOWETT,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"Do you say orable?""",62
310,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"It would be distinctly unparliamentary for me to suggest any other terinv. A similar Bill to this was introduced in New Zealand just recently with a view to overcoming some trouble that was threatening in the coal industry there; but I believe that it has not provided the desired industrial balm. Then, again, the idea suggested in the Bill is not a new one, seeing that President Will son introduced a somewhat similar measure in the United States of America during the period of the war; and .we know how hopeless things became in America from an industrial stand-point. What is required is some means by which the prices of commodities and the necessaries of l if e can be fixed at the same time as are wages and conditions. has been proved that no sooner does the working man obtainl an improvement in his wages and conditions, than the advantage is taken away from h'im owing to the manner in which the cost of living is increased by the commercial institutions of the country.",62
311,Mr JOWETT,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,The employer passes it on?,62
312,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"Absolutely , and adds more for himself; and the position thus becomes more acute. The Prime Minister has gvven us the assurance that this Bill is introduced with the idea of supplementing the Arbitration Court, but clause 17 is a provision for superseding that Court. It reads as follows: Notwithstanding anything in this Act, if a special tribunal is satisfied that abnormal cumstances have arisen which affect the fundamental justice of any terms of an award made by the Court, the tribunal may set aside or vary any terms so affected. We ought to be able to establish a medium whereby there, will not be so much overlapping.",62
313,Mr FENTON,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,The Arbitration .Court should have been given that power long ago.,62
314,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"That is quite correct. If it had been given that power it could have dealt more effectively with the claims before it . The trouble is that there is so much duplication of evidence, which has to be given over and over again when one set ought to be sufficient to enable an award to be made in respect to several claims. The consequence is that it is sometimes two years before an award is ""hon- given. The organization of which I am a member has had its case prepared for some considerable time past, but has not been able to submit it to the Court, and the possibility is that when it does reach the Court eventually a new set of circumstances may prevail. If we had concentrated our efforts on making the present forms of arbitration more effective by expediting the hearing of and the giving of awards, by enabling the Court to make its decisions more effective by controlling the cost of living, and by eliminating some of the great cost involved in approaching the Court, we would have achieved a greater measure of industrial peace than we have had in recent years.",62
315,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,This Bill is in tended to avoid a lot of that.,62
316,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"In addition to the great It amount of duplication in the hearing of cases, there are so many opportunities for appeal that the continual use of the power to appeal causes awards to be held in abeyance, and the maintenance of this power may be the means of , creating greater industrial unrest than we have at the present time. The present position is that arbitration may be regarded as an economic fallacy, because we are endeavouring to smooth out industrial difficulties without removing the causes.",62
317,Sir JOSEPH COOK,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"Hear , hear ! We have here a Bill which says, "" Come and let us reason together.""",62
318,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"But this afternoon the right honourable gentleman was not prepared to give an opportunity for that cir- reasoning. He would not allow organized labour to meet the Government and give them the benefit of their advice and assistance. When we find that at the very inception the Government are not prepared to accept the advice and assistance of the workers, we have cause to doubt their anxiety to find a solution for industrial . unrest, and may have cause to believe that there is something behind this Bill which may have the opposite effect. Por a long time past the employers in Australia have not been too pleased with compulsory arbitration. I have with me a report of a lecture given by Mr H . Y . Braddon on compulsory arbitration, in which he was anything but favourable to the principle. A copy of the lecture was forwarded to honourable members, and the covering letter put forward the statement that "" in view of the unsatisfactory experience of compulsory arbitration some alternative method more likely to set up satisfactory relations between capital and labour should' be evolved "" ; and the Government was urged to call a convention representative of employers and employees. I have come to the belief that this legislation now before us is the outcome very largely of that feeling of dissatisfaction which prevails among Chambers of Commerce and Chambers of Manufacturers in the Commonwealth. At a conference held in A p r i l last. Mr H . V . MCKay repeated certain words used by the Prime Minister to the effect that the Arbitration Act was perhaps the most unfortunate and futil e effort that had ever come out of the laboratory of any industrial workshop, and said the time had arrived for the absolute abolition of the Act .",62
319,Mr BLUNDELL,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"Many tribunals would endorse that opinion, foolishly, I think.",63
320,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"That may be so in renot gard to arbitration as we have it today, because of the congestion at the Court.",63
321,Mr BLUNDELL,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"No , they would in dorse it in respect to the principle rally.",63
322,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"I believe that there a big section of the working community who favour the principle of arbitration, but that alone will not give us a complete solution of our industrial difficulties. Nothing but a change of those stances which allow one section of the - Mr 1 TAKIN people to take advantage of the other tion, and to impose on them such exachave tions as merely help to satisfy their greed, will ever give satisfaction to those who manner. have advanced thoughts upon industrial and economic matters.",63
323,Mr JOWETT,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,Do you not change of spirit will go a long way?,63
324,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"'There will need to be a great change, both of mind and heart, on the part of the employers. The working man is the person who has been subjected to grave injustice for many years.",63
325,Mr JOWETT,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,There must be a change of spirit on both sides.,63
326,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"S in s of commission are more apparent on the side of the employers and the capitalistic forces generally of this and other countries, than of those whom I represent. It appears that there is some desire to supersede the Arbitration Court. A feeling of dissatisfaction has prevailed among the employing section with many of the judgments given by Mr Justice Higgins, and they think this is a favourable opportunity to r i d themselves of one who has at least endeavoured to do his part in meting out justice to all sections of the community. This Bill could, be made to do a great amount of good if it contained provisions safeguarding the rights of organized labour; but I want honourable members to recognise that it will not overcome all the industrial unrest that prevails, nor do I think it will minimize it to the extent that some honourable members opposite think it will. It gives a splendid opportunity to the one who is charged with administering it to determine its influence either for good on for evil. No doubt the Prime Minister himself will have a great say in the administration of the Act , but opinions have been expressed regarding hi™ which do fill us with confidence in the success of the measure if he has to administer it . His dictatorial manner does not give us - assurance of his success in this capacity. gene Mr O. C. Beale, speaking at the same conference of manufacturers as I menis tioned earlier, said, "" They would agree that all the wisdom of the ages was not contained in Will i a m Morris Hughes.""",63
327,Sir JOSEPH COOK,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"What - a f e a r f u l circumthing for him to say! - I have no doubt that secat one time the honourable member would agreed with Mr Beale, and even expressed himself in a more pronounced",63
328,Sir JOSEPH COOK,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,I subscribe to every word of that sentence^ thin k a,63
329,Mr MAKIN,A BILL TO NORMALIZE INDUSTRY AND,"The skeleton nature of this Bill is very unsatisfactory. It ' is certainly the skeleton in the industrial cupboard. The Bill will give little or no opportunity to establish in dustrial peace, unless it is considerably amended. Those who are to act on the various Judiciaries must be strictly non-partisan,, and free from political in fluences if they are to command the entire confidence of both sides, and of the public as a whole. Only by these means, and by safeguarding the rights of organized labour, will we have any guarantee of freedom in the future from, the conditions which create industrial unrest, uncertainty, and dissatisfaction, most of whioh arises from the knowledge that justice is not done to those to whom justice is due. Debate (on motion by Mr ATKINSON) adjourned. House adjourned at 10.18 p.m.",63
