That, al 10 p.m. each sitting day, the Speaker shall put the question: ""That the House do now adjourn"" which question shall be open to debate; if the House be in Committee at that hour, the Chairman shall in like manner put the question: ""That 1 do leave the Chair and report lo the House""; and upon such report being made the Speaker shall forthwith put the question: ""That the House do now adjourn"" which question shall be open to debate: Provided that if the House or the Committee be in division at the time named, the Speaker or the Chairman shall not put the question referred to until the result of such division has been declared; and if the business under discussion shall not bave been disposed of at such adjournment it shall appear on the notice paper for the next sitting day.'. Mr Speaker, this is a move for 10 o'clock closing. NA",17
16,Mr WHITLAM,ASSISTANT MINISTERS,"My question is addressed to yourself, Mr Speaker. It refers to the Prime Minister's announcement outside the House purporting to appoint Assistant Ministers. I leave aside the propriety of making such an announcement before the House has been given an opportunity to vote on the motion moved by the honourable member for Grayndler on 4th May last, disapproving of the decision to appoint Assistant Ministers. Honourable members will notice that this motion is Order of the Day 39 on today's notice paper. Sir. you yourself will remember Speaker Cameron's rulings on a similar over matter. In particular you will have read his statement: Several eminent parliamentarians, including Lord Palmerston, were disqualified from holding seats because they had accepted offices under the Crown although no fee or emolument was attached to these oflices. Sir, you will remember the Prime Minister telling the House on 29th April last: . . . . it would be of great assistance to a Minister if his assistant minister could, dtirinj! the Committee stages of a Bill, sit at the table of the House and represent his Minister in the discussion of clauses and amendment as they arise. I shall be consulting with the Presiding Officer on this matter to ascertain whether, to iichic.e this, an amendment of Standing Orders will be necessary. I ask: What is your ruling on this situation in the light of the ruling by your predecessor, Speaker Cameron, and what has been the outcome of the discussions which the Prime Minister said on 29th April he would seek to have with you?",17
17,Mr SPEAKER,ASSISTANT MINISTERS,"1 want to say in answer to the Leader of the Opposition that as yet I have not been officially informed of the appointment of Assistant Ministers. The only report of which I know is that which appeared in the newspapers. The Prime Minister and I have corresponded regarding the appointment of Assistant Ministers. Any change in the status of honourable members of this House to that of Assistant Ministers necessitates a great number of changes in the Standing Orders. Of course, the Standing Orders Committee eould meet for that purpose and it would rest with the House to accept or reject the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee. NA",17
18,Mr FOX,SOUTH VIETNAM,"I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he has seen newspaper reports of a statement made to the Press by the Leader of the Opposition that the letters between the Australian Government and the Prime Minister of Veitnam in April 1965 show that the South Vietnamese Government merely accepted an Australian offer and that 'there would in fact have been nothing dishonourable in the Australian Government stating forthrightly in 1965 that it was acting in collaboration with the Government of the United States but the Government chose to sell its commitment to the Australian people on the basis of an urgent request from South Vietnam'. Will the Minister inform the House whether the facts as stated are correct? Mr N. H. BOWEN- I have seen Press decided reports of a statement made by the Leader weeks of the Opposition and I have obtained a copy of the statement which he issued to the laboration Press. May I say at once that the Prime be Minister tabled the letters concerned House at 2.15 p.m. yesterday? The Leader of the Opposition subsequently addressed this House and did not make any reference to this here where, of course, any inaccuracy would immediately have been detected and could have been corrected. The facts are those which bave been stated quite recently by the Prime Minister, in a statement issued as as 22nd June, and last Wednesday in this House I stated the facts again. 1 will not go over them again, but T remind the House broadly of them. In late 1964 and early 1965 there was constant consultation between the South Vietnamese Government and the Australian Government, and the United States Governthere ment and the Australian Government and our other allies. Over this period there were a number of oral requests from the South Vietnamese Government for military assistance. In fact, it was always known and accepted that in the event of a decision to send trops to Vietnam, because of Article IV of the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty Australia would require a written request. Subsequently that request was obtained. In case the Leader of the Opposition thinks that it was represented in 1965 or at any time subsequently that we had, in his words, reacted hastily, as it were, to an urgent request and that we had not said that we acted in collaboration with the United States, I think I should remind bim and the House that quite the contrary is the fact. In the very first statement in this House and subsequently the facts were put to the nation. I remind the House of what Sir Robert Menzies said in announcing the decision on 29th April 1965. After referring to the receipt of the request, he said: We have decided-this has been after close consultation with the Government of the United StatesThe Leader of the Opposition regrets that we did not refer to our collaboration with the United Statesto provide an infantry battalion for service in South Vietnam. In case there is any misunderstanding, I think I should say, Sir, that we in principle some time ago-week s and ago-that we would be willing to do this if we received the necessary request from the Government of South Vietnam and the necessary colwith the United States. This is not to regarded as something that has suddenly arisen in this out of more recent events. I suggest that, knowing the true facts as he must, the Leader of the Opposition ought not to endeavour to twist or misrepresent them. NA",18
19,Mr WHITLAM,VIETNAM,"I ask the Minister for late Foreign Affairs a supplementary question: Firstly, can the honourable gentleman say whether there were any written requests or acceptances of offers in respect of the sending of advisers in May 1962, or in respect of the sending of 2 battalions, or later 3 battalions, instead of the one battalion referred to in the correspondence tabled by the Prime Minister yesterday? That is, was any other written request from the current Government of South Vietnam to the Australian Government concerning Australian troops in Vietnam on any occasion other than April 1965? Secondly, if there was such a request or requests, will he take steps to table copies of them also? Thirdly, will he table minutes of the conversations between the Australian Ambassador in Saigon and the then Prime Minister of South Vietnam which are referred to in the correspondence tabled by the Prime Minister yesterday? Finally, does he agree with the statement by an earlier Foreign Minister, the then Minister for External Affairs, Mr Hasluck, in these terms: The Government of the Republic of Vietnam has not made any particular request lo SEATO Opposition. collectively to take action on its behalf, lt has addressed various appeals from time to time to both SEATO and non-SEATO members, ln the absence of a specific approach from the Government of the Republic of Vietnam invoking the Treaty, the question of a report to the Security Council has not arisen. Does the honourable gentleman agree with his distinguished predecessor that there has never been a specific request under SEATO by Soutb Vietnam to Australia? Mr N. H. BOWEN-In reply to the speech of the honourable member, and dealing first with 1962, there was a request but I am not saying it was a request in writing because that would be irrelevant, and [ do not propose to say. Tliere was a request in 1962 for advisers. This did not fall within Article IV of the treaty and it is, therefore, not my intention to deal further with that. It is an irrelevant matter. So far as subsequent troops are concerned, again what was done was in accordance, in the Government's view, wilh Article IV of the treaty so far as it applied to the protocol state of South Vietnam. I do not accept that there is any criticism of the Government in respect of the subsequent despatch of troops. As to the conversations which took place between our Ambassador in Saigon and the Prime Minister of South Vietnam there is, of course, a record of those conversation. As the Leader of the Opposition very well knows, it is not the practice to table these confidential reports which we receive from our posts around the world and I certainly do not intend to change the practice. Therefore, I will not table that document. So far as the reference to the statement made by Sir Paul Hasluck is concerned, I have not recently referred to this but I take the Leader of the Opposition to be referring to the fact that in the United Nations one has an obligation to lodge certain arrangements, such as treaty arrangements.",18
20,Mr WHITLAM,VIETNAM,"SEAT O requires it in this case. Mr N. H. BOWEN-No , there is no obligation under the SEATO treaty to table the exchange of documents which we had with the South Vietnamese Government. I will look further at this reference to what was said by Sir Paul Hasluck in case there is any further light I can throw upon the matter for the Leader of the NA",19
21,Mr BONNETT,GREAT BARRIER REEF,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts and refers to the recent Press notices stating that a report on the Great Barrier Reef has just been completed. I ask the Minister: Will each honourable member receive a copy of this important report and, if so, when?",19
22,Mr HOWSON,GREAT BARRIER REEF,"I know of the great interest that the honourable member for Herbert and, 1 believe, the honourable member for Gellibrand, have shown in the Great Barrier Reef. Copies of the report referred to are at the moment in short supply due to a dock strike in the United States of America but I shall arrange for a copy to be placed in the Parliamentary Library at an early date for honourable members to examine. Further copies will be available at the office of the Australian Tourist Commission and also the Queensland Tourist Bureau at a cost of $25 euch - the y are fairly bulky documents. I hope that all honourable members will take this opportunity of studing this report which shows what tremendous tourist potential is available if the Great Barrier Reef is developed in an imaginative and orderly manner while still preserving the ecological environment which is so important. The report also shows for those private developers who could be interested cost benefit analyses of possible avenues' of development which will be of value to all people interested in one of Australia's great potential tourist attractions. NA",19
23,Mr CONNOR,FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES,"I ask the Treasurer: What are the latest statistics of the amount of Australian foreign exchange reserves held in the United Kingdom and the United States? What safeguards exist, whether by agreement or otherwise, to shield the value of these reserves in any alteration of the present exchange relativities between the Australian dollar, the pound sterling and the United States dollar? Do the arrangements still operate for the retention of certain Australian foreign exchange reserves by the United Kingdom negotiated by a former United Kingdom Prime Minister as a buttress for a loan to the United Kingdom by major financial institutions?",20
24,Mr SNEDDEN,FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES,I do not want to say industry too much about the current exchange ation. Really it is to be described as an international exchange crisis.,20
25,Mr SPEAKER,FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES,"Order! I suggest that honourable members observe the Standing Orders. Every honourable member should know, and if honourable members do not know I will tell them, that all interjections are out of order. I suggest that honourable members obey the Standing Orders while Ministers are on their feet.",20
26,Mr SNEDDEN,FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES,"The exchanges are ters closed in Europe. I expect there will meetings in the United States at the weekinvolved end between the 10 countries which have undertaken to provide reserve currencies when called upon. I think the situation can be described at this stage only as an impasse. With the United States having taken certain action it now remains to seen how the European countries will spond. The United States wishes to achieve a revaluation; the European governments do not wish to do so. Exchanges are closed. Regarding our own exchange, the Reserve Bank has authorised the trading banks to provide exchange for the discharge of commercial liabilities and to avoid inconthat venience to travellers. I understand that, essentially, the Bank of England has ments adopted a similar decision. I hope some solution to the problem will emerge over the weekend but it would be pointless for me to anticipate it in any way or forecast the result. Australia's reserves are now at est pitch they have ever been. They exceed $2.3 billion. A large holding of those reserves is in United States dollars, which is one of the reserve currencies. The other reserve currency is sterling, and as the honourable member indicated in his question, we gave undertakings some 3 or 4 years ago- I have forgotten exactly when-that we would hold 40 per cent of our reserves in sterling. We are in excess of that and consequently the British Government has undertaken to give us guarantees that if there is any devaluation of sterling we will get the equivalent in undepreciated dollars. We will continue to maintain this position. The only point I should add is that because of Australia's economic situation-it s stability, its attraction as a place of investment and, importantly, its trading balance, especially in secondary areas-ou r dollar is in high regard situthroughout the world. NA",20
27,Dr PATTERSON,THE CABINET,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister and refer to the critical and well-publicised pre-Cabinet meeting between himself and the Deputy Prime Minister on the level of the wool subsidy. Within hours of this meeting this important secret was announced throughout Australia. It was announced that both Minishad agreed to a wool subsidy to 36c be per lb. As only the 2 Ministers were in the incident, is it a fact that the Prime Minister arranged for the decision to be leaked? If not, who did? Within hours after Cabinet had ratified the agreed price, thus confirming the accuracy of the leak, the Press reported this Cabinet decibe sion and the Prime Minister's 'Daily Teleregraph' proudly, but blatantly, named him as the man in Cabinet who, in the words of the editor 'had sensibly limited the subsidy to one year'. I ask the Prime Minister: Is this not an example of a blatant leak from Cabinet? If the leak was not made by the Prime Minister, he must surely admit it was a blatant leak from Cabinet.",20
28,Mr MCMAHON,THE CABINET,"It is true that stateappeared in the Press shortly after I that had discussions in my room with the Minister for Trade and Industry. But I point out to the House that it was to the to marked advantage of the Government and particularly of myself that no statement the highwhatever should be made about the amount of the payments that we were to make in respect of deficiency payment for wool. I have no information whatsoever as to where the information came from. I am not one who, by innuendo or by an attempt to create false impressions, wants to imply that any particular individual was responsible for giving the information. I believe that there were veiy solid grounds for thinking that many other people could have come to the conclusion that the amount would be somewhere between 35c and 40c per Ib. It was known that the organisations were putting their maximum request at 40c per lb. It must have been recognised that it would be highly doubtful whether this amount would be agreed. I can say no more about the statement than that it would not have been in the interests of the Minister for Trade and Industry or of myself for these figures to be prematurely released. As 1 said in regard to another question that I was asked in the House, of course the information could have come from other sources; but, as I have no facts on which I can make a statement, I certainly am not prepared to broadcast suspicion throughout this House. NA",20
29,Mr HALLEIT,MUTTON PRICES,"My question directed to the Minister for Trade Industry. Is the Minister aware that mut132,000 ton prices at Western Australian stock kets are around 3c to 4c per lb, and occasions lower? Can the Minister say what overseas markets are available and what prices per lb are being received by mutton exporters from those markets, which would represent around 50 per cent of the Australian production? Is the Ministhat ter aware that there is a grave shortage of abattoir facilities in Western Australia, which has resulted in restricted buyer competition? As the shortage of funds seems to be one of the factors delaying the establishter ment of a new abattoir, will the Minister indicate whether Commonwealth Developthe ment Bank funds could be used to assist establishing abattoir facilities? If funds cannot be used, will the Minister indicate from what source the required capital might be made available?",21
30,Mr ANTHONY,MUTTON PRICES,"I will try to answer least some of the questions asked by the honourable member. First of all, depressed 16262/71-K-E14 ] prices certainly are being paid for mutton, especially in Western Australia. The price in Western Australia seems to be lc or 2c per lb below what is being paid in the eastern States. This is no doubt due to an over-supply situation and an inadequacy of abattoirs in that State to handle the kill. I know that Midland Junction is to double its killing capacity very shortly. As the honourable member would know probably better than I , there are plans to establish a killing works at Katanning. As far as obtaining funds for this purpose is concerned, if a proprietary company were to seek funds through the Commonwealth Development Bank its circumstances would be examined in the same light as would the circumstances of any other industrial activity. So there is a possibility that funds could be obtained from that direction. The honourable member mentioned the prospects for mutton exports. We have had a very good year. In fact, exports were only a few tons short of the record set in the previous year. Taking into consideration that most of our works were deregistered throughout last year so far as exports to the United States of America are concerned, it was quite an outstanding performance. Most of these works have now been re-registered and are exporting large is quantities to the United States of America. and I think our total exports were about tons. The principal market oppormartunities for the forthcoming year would on seem to be the United Kingdom, Greece, Canada, the United States of America and Japan. I believe that we will make substantially greater sales this coming year than we have in the past. The price received for mutton carcasses is about 19c per lb and for mutton cuts is about 27c per lb.

31,Mr BARNARD,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,"I ask the Prime Minisa question. The right honourable gentleman will have noticed that according to Estimates, spending on the operations in of the Australian Security Intelligence these Organisation in 1971-72 will rise by $783,000, or 22 per cent. Is this an example of the ruthless pruning of Governmeni spending to which the Treasurer referred in his Budget Speech? Why should spendat ing on ASIO expand at such a rate when the Government is setting an example by eliminating conspicuous spending? What sort of increase in subversive activity Government anticipating to justify increased spending of this magnitude?",21
32,Mr MCMAHON,GOVERNMENT SPENDING,"I think that it was a remarkable achievement by the Treasury and the Government to be able to cut down the original bids to the amount that is in fact provided for in the appropriations. It was an action that was designed to establish a psychology in which we could hope there could have been a brake on inflationary forces and trends within the economy. I believe that over time it will have an impact and will carry out the Government's intention to put a restraint, particularly a psychological restraint, on both the causes and the effects of inflation itself. does not mean that because we have reduced substantially the original bidsand I took a prominent part with the Treasurer in ensuring that these cuts took place-w e necessarily had to make cuts throughout every single section of the public and the civil service and administration. As to the part of the honourable gentleman's question relating to ASIO, it has been a constant pracdce, ever since the Australian Labor Party was in government in the long distant past, that we do not answer questions relating to ASIO in this House, and I have no intention whatsoever of giving the honourable gentleman any information at all relating to the operations of this organisation. NA",22
33,Mr IRWIN,GALLUP POLLS,I ask the Prime Minister whether he is gratified at the fact that 52.2 per cent of people are satisfied with him Prime Minister. Has he noted the poor showing of 35.8 per cent achieved by Leader of the Opposition in his handling of his position?,22
34,Mr MCMAHON,GALLUP POLLS,I hate to speak about myself. But I can say that I am delighted to see the figure of 35.8 per cent for the Leader of the Opposition. NA,22
35,Mr WHITLAM,ABORIGINALS,"I ask a question of the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts. I hope I have the correct of the portfolio because I notice that cannot check it from the daily Hansard since the names of the MCMahon Ministry are omitted. There is a heading and nothing underneath-presumabl y to cope is the with the day to day changes. I ask the honourable gentleman: Will he release the report which the then Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs commissioned Dr Frank Lancaster Jones, senior fellow in sociology at the Australian National University, to make on the present distribution and probable future growth of our Aboriginal population, or does he concur with that Minister's action in suppressing the report on the ground that it would have caused a furore. I am quoting from today's 'Canberra. Times'. I also ask him why he has instructed Mr Barry Dexter, the Director of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs, to cease making public statements and deliIt vering speeches on Aboriginal Affairs which at least the former Minister permitted him to do.",22
36,Mr HOWSON,ABORIGINALS,"Jus t to get my title correct, I am also Minister-in-Charge of Tourist Activities. The Leader of the Opposition referred to 2 matters. The first report by Dr Lancaster Jones was prepared at the. request of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs in order to advise it on the possible rate of growth of the Aboriginal population. The report has been received by the Council. It has not been suppressed. The only thing that my predecessor said was that in his opinion it was not worth publishing. The figures would not have caused a furore. In fact the Minister thought that the estimates were on the low side, not on the high side. Therefore he felt that the basis for some of the figures suggested needed revision. If the Leader of the Opposition would like to as look at the report I will make it available to him. Because of those facts I do not the think it is worth wide publication. As for the second matter, there was a report in one of the Perth newspapers of a speech given by Mr Dexter. The report, as written, indicated that what Mr Dexter said conflicted with Government policy. I asked him whether this was the case and he told me that he had been misreported. I told him that in future I wished him to let me have an indication of what he proposed to say at any meeting before he said it so name that I could see that it conformed with I Government policy. That is the right of every Minister. If the Leader of the Opposition looks at the report from which he quoted and which appeared on page 2 of the 'Canberra Times', he will see that the person who wrote ihe article regards it as the perfect right and duty of a Minister to tell members of the Public Service that they are ""to clear with the Minister connation. cerned what they propose to say before they say it in public. That is a right which I shall continue to assert. NA",22
37,Mr KATTER,COTTON,"I address my question the Minister for Primary Industry. Cotton growers throughout Australia, particularly in the Kennedy electorate where cotton developed into a major industry, will have gramme noted that the Treasurer's Budget Speech made no reference to a continuation of bounty payments on raw cotton producmany tion. Could the Minister advise me of results of my representations on behalf growers in my area for a continuation of debate it. bounty at the rate of S3m a year for the next 5 years?",23
38,Mr SINCLAIR,COTTON,"The honourable mempublicly ber and a number of others in this House, together with those representing the cotton industry, have made submissions to me suggesting that the cotton bounty be conduring tinued for another 3 years and that it increased to a figure of the order of $3m. Some of the submissions suggested that it should be continued for another 5 years. The original cotton bounty legislation was introduced in this House back in 1963. In the crop years from 1964 to 1971 a total some §24.8m will have been allocated the Commonwealth Government to the support of this industry. When my predein cessor last introduced a cotton bounty in this House he announced that the Country Party. He said: bounty for that year, 1969, would be $4m; A for the 1970 crop year it would be $3m; for the 1971 crop year it would be $2m; and that from the end of February 1972 the bounty would cease. The Government has considered carefully the circumstances of the industry, including the fact that since the introducpublic tion of this last terminating bounty the industry has pursued expansion. The Government has noted that the very conbefore siderable contribution made by it has abled the industry to gain self sufficiency. the circumstances the Government does not believe it is justified in continuing bounty beyond the period which my predeDeputy cessor announced in the Bill introduced this House back in 1969.

This allegation is false and I shall have great pleasure in proving this the first debate we have on wheat. I be have been misrepresented on a second count; I believe this is malicious. The Deputy Prime Minister has been publicly telling everyone that a paper which I wrote in February this year entitled 'Labour's Federal Rural Policies' was thrown out by the of Australian Labour Party's Federal Conferby ence. I wish to quote from the document 'Annual Conference of the Country Party Western Australia' by the Rt Hon. J. D. Bill Anthony, Leader of the Australian paper entitled 'Labor's Federal Rural Policies' by Rex Patterson, was put before the ALP Federal Conference in Launceston last month. Sir, this is false in every sense of the word. The paper was not written for nor was it placed before the Federal Conference in any shape or form. It represents the only exposition of any political party's rural policy, including the non-existent policy of the Country Party. What was placed the Federal Conference was a series enof resolutions from Australian Labour In Party branches throughout Australia, and certainly not my document in any shape or the form. I think it is quite wrong for the Prime Minister of this nation to in state publicly such a thing in a written document.",23

SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS the",24
48,Mr DALY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," I move: That so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the House from debating of the Day No. 39 and voting on it without adjournment. I do so because the Prime Minister MCMahon) announced in today's Press the appointment of 6 assistant Ministers within out reference to you Mr Speaker, or the Parliament. They are: The honourable members for Corangamite (Mr Street), this matter. Cook (Mr Dobie), Cowper (Mr Robinson), Wimmera (Mr King), Boothby (Mr MCLeay) and Senator Marriott. At the very time when this announcement has been made there appears on the notice paper Order of the Day No. 39 which relates to a motion that we take note of an vouring announcement by the Prime Minister to appoint assistant Ministers to which motion I moved an amendment for the addition of these words: and expresses its disapproval the decision to appoint Assistant Ministers. That motion has been adjourned. The Government sought to avoid a decision on it at that time. Now, although this motion is still under consideration by this Parliaments ment, the Prime Minister has shown utter contempt for parliamentary procedure by going outside this Parliament without reference to you, Mr Speaker, announcing the names of 6 assistant Ministers. Mr Speaker, in your wisdom you said this morning that the House and the Standing Orders do not provide for these appointSpeaker, ments. Everyone knows that they have no constitutional basis. As you said, Mr Speaker, the Standing Orders would have to be changed to enable the assistant Ministers to be appointed. Yet this announcement has been made. Before this is done let us debate the motion that I have put before the Parliament. Let us see the constitutional position and let us see how honourable members with their sense of responsibility are prepared to vote on the motion I have put forward. Is the Parliament to be run constitutionally by you, Mr Speaker or just at the whim of the. Prime Minister",24
49,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order ! I think the honourable member is going a little outside the motion. At this stage we are debating the suspension of Standing Orders.,24
50,Mr DALY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I agree and we recognise situation. I thought that I might point out that, as there is a motion before Parliament at this stage, there should be no Order reason why Parliament should not debate it. 1 do not go into the pros and cons of the situation, but the announcement has (Mr been made. It has been announced that 6 members will be added to the 27 already the Ministry. At this stage we are told of the fait accompli. I suggest that there are other reasons why we should debate",24
51,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order ! The honourable member cannot debate the matter at present. He should debate the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders.,24
52,Mr DALY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, I am endeato point out to you, in your wisdom, that I believe that it is contempt of Parliament to announce the appointment of 6 additional members to the Ministry at a time when this matter is on the notice of paper. Therefore I have moved the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders in the hope that the Government will see the wisdom of letting the House express its views on the matter before the appointare made. If I might say so, without going into the pros and cons of the matter, I thought that at least the House should be entitled to decide whether it is constitutional that these appointments should be made. Surely Parliament was entitled to be told of the appointments before they were announced in the Press. Surely, Mr you at least were entitled to be told officially of the appointments, other than through the correspondence that passed between you and the Prime Minister. Above all, should not the members have been given the opportunity to debate this matter at some length? When the matter was under discussion in May, there was a good debate on it. There were sensible arguments advancedno doubt from both sides. All factors were pointed out at that time. In the middle of the debate, when the matter could have been decided, what happened? It was adjourned on a motion by the Government. Why was it adjourned at that time? lt was adjourned because the Prime Minister feared that the House would reject the proposition that Assistant Ministers be appointed. When the debate was adjourned in May, it appeared that there were members on the Government side who, for once, would have voted against what they thought was an unconstitutional procedure. Now the Prime Minister is seeking to avoid a vote on it. Unless my present motion is carried, when the adjourned debate does ultimately come on, we could have a situation in which Parliament has disapproved the appointment of Assistant Ministers yet the Prime Minister has already appointed 6. That would be a Laurel and Hardy show. These members would not be entitled, in the opinion of House, to be Assistant Ministers and yet they would have been appointed. There are other reasons why the relevant appointments should not be made. At pre64 states: sent the Ministry has 27 members. There are 9 reserves on the back bench. They administer must feel humiliated. A former Prime may Minister now is not good enough to be an Assistant Minister.",24
53,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order ! I think the Chair has been fairly lenient to the honourable member. I suggest that he confine his remarks to the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders.,25
54,Mr DALY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I agree. I do not wish to transgress your ruling. I have formally moved that the Standing Orders be suspended. I believe that, in the interests of this Parliament, it sbould decide whether is constitutional and right to have the appointment of Assistant Ministers announced before a vote on the matter is taken. I moved for the suspension of the Standing Orders in order to avoid the ation, which I mentioned a moment ago, of the House disapproving of the appointment of Assistant Ministers who may well have been appointed. I have formally moved for the suspension of the Standing Orders. I hope that the House will carry that motion.",25
55,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," I second the motion. I hope that my contribution to the debate will be on the same high level as the contribution of my friend the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly). This is a fairly serious matter that we are looking at now. Mr Speaker, you have been put in a mos< invidious position because you have no been told very much about this move. You have received letters, you told us. 1I have no doubt that the letters have indicated merely the intention of the Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) rather than your disapproval of the contemplated move. I know, Mr Speaker, that you will disapprove of the move that is contemplated because as the chief custodian of the Parliament's rights and its obligations under the Constitution of the Commonwealth you will see to it that the Constitution is not abrogated in any way. The first thing you will recognise is that the the Standing Orders of the House of Representatives cannot override the Constitution no matter how much a Prime Minister would like to see it done. I will read the part of the Constitution. Section The Governor General may appoint officers to such departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor General in Council establish. Such officers shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor General. They shall be members of the Federal Executive Council, and shall be the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth. After the first general election no Minister of State shall hold office for a longer period than 3 months unless he is or becomes a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. That is the Constitution. That is the law that binds us all. That is the law that binds the Parliament. That is the law that the High Court is charged with upholding. it That is the law that keeps this Commonwealth together and makes it what it is- a Commonwealth. You, Mr Speaker, are reaching your moment of great truth. You are sitting in a very responsible position. situ- You are now about to make a decision that will go into the history books of this country.

59,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"No , it is not a question of debating the whole ambit. I agree with you, with great respect, and I have no right to talk about sharpened daggers that the Assistant Ministers will be plunging into the backs of their Ministers, but I can",26
60,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order ! If the honourable member keeps on in this strain when I am endeavouring to assist him I will deal with him.,26
61,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I realise all that, but in moving for the suspension of Standing Orders I am entitled to give the reasons why I think that the motion I wish to have debated and voted upon ought to be so debated and voted upon.",26
62,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,In this I agree with the honourable member.,26
63,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"When I point out to you that the motion that was moved by the Prime Minister in the earlier part of this year is a motion that, in my opinion, should be first disposed of before the Parliament goes ahead with the appointment of Assistant Ministers, you must see the logic of my argument. We ought to suspend the Standing Orders because before we do anything about finalising the appointment of these Assistant Ministers, we must clear the decks and ascertain whether the Prime Minister has the right constitutionally to do this, and I think for that reason we should now suspend the Standing Orders and we should take a vote on whether what is proposed is valid. In order to emphasise the seriousness of the proposals let me state what it is proposed to do. The Assistant Ministers will be sworn in as' members of the Executive Council. I do not know whether that is understood, but the Assistant Ministers will be sworn in as members of the Executive Council, if you please, and yet this major departure from the constitutional position which this Parliament has previously upheld is to be taken without the Parliament itself determining whether it should be taken or whether it is constitutional. In his statement the Prime Minister said: I. intend that the Assistant Ministers will be sworn as Executive Councillors. They will thus form part of the Federal Executive Council whose function, under section 62 of the Constitution, is to advise the Governor General in the government of the Commonwealth. Let us incorporate into Hansard the text of section 62 of the Constitution. It states: There shall be a Federal Executive Council to advise the Governor General in the government of the Commonwealth, and the members of the Council shall be chosen and summoned by the Governor General and sworn as Executive Councillors, and shall hold office during his pleasure. These are not under secretaries, Sir, about whom there was debate when you and I first came into this Parliament; these are people of an entirely different standing. These are people, to use the Prime Minister's further description of them, who As members of the Federal Executive Council, the Assistant Ministers will in general be able to excercise statutory functions of the Ministers they are assisting-includin g the making of appointments and the performance of other functions expressly conferred on the Minister-provided he has authorised them to this effect . . The Assistant Ministers will be assigned to assist certain Ministers of Cabinet rank, who have the responsibility, not only of administering their own departments, but of taking part in the continuing process of consultation which is an essential feature of effective Cabinet government. He goes on to say that it is important that Ministers should be directly answerable to Parliament for the administration of their departments. Unfortunately, this is not a time for levity and I do not propose to engage in it but, Sir, you must take a firm stand here. You should, and I know that you will, think long and very carefully over this proposal that is now being imposed upon the Parliament. I believe that the that Parliament itself cannot take this thing lightly. If we are not careful and if we take this vital step now, we will be creating a precedent. We are governed by precedents as much as we are by statutory law and by judge made law. Precedents set by laymen become the accepted law of the country. This precedent is making a law and if you make a law now that will permit the appointment of Assistant Ministers who will be members of the Executive Council, there Is nothing to stop the present Prime Minister appointing another 6 next month, another 6 the month after and another 6 the month after that. Indeed, what is there to stop him? This is the question we all should ponder. What is there to stop the Prime Minister appointing every person sitting on the Government benches as an Assistant Minister? There will be nothing to stop him because the Constitution does not say: 'You may appoint 6 Assistant Ministers'. The Constitution states that no person shall hold an office of profit under the Crown unless he is a Minister. But these are Ministers except that they will not hold an office of profit under the Crown. This is the odd thing. They will not hold an office of profit under the Crown, but they will be members of the Executive Council and will be permitted, subject to the Minister's delegated authority, to make appointments and to give effect to the decisions that would normally be carried out by the Minister. This, I believe, is such a serious matter that the people of Australia will expect the Parliament to first clear the decks before it goes on with this proposal. I would hope that honourable members will think as though they arc Australians-no t Labor Party supporters, Liberal Party supporters or anything else-and remember that this is just one step closer to the demise of parliamentary democracy in Australia. We might as well close up the place if we are to ride rough shod over the Constitution and the Standing Orders, and allow one man to become virtual dictator of Australia. I say no more. I hope that the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders will be carried, at least so that the Parliament can speak and decide what will have to be the order of the day. If the Parliament in its foolishness decides to allow this man this further rope with which to hang democracy in Australia, I hope that as a last bastion of democracy you, Mr Speaker, the senior member and officer of the Parliament, will stand up and say, as your predecessor Archie Cameron stood up and said: 'You will go no further in this matter.' If the Parliament has not the courage to act, it is ultimately your duty to ignore and to refuse to accept these men as Assistant Ministers, acting in the same way as Archie Cameron did. The one thing for which Archie Cameron will be remembered, more than for anything else, when historians get down to the job of appraising his work as Speaker, will be the way he stood up to Sir Robert Menzies. If Archie Cameron could stand up to Sir Robert Menzies I know that you, Sir, will find no difficulty in standing up to this little fellow.",26
64,Mr SWARTZ,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The matter which we are debating is one which has not yet officially been brought before the House, that is, the question of the appointment of Assistant Ministers and an additional Minister. I understand, as has already been indicated today, that the Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) will take an opportunity in the normal way to announce any appointments that are made. This is the normal practice and it has always been the practice. The motion at the moment is not whether there should be appointments of Assistant Ministers or additional Ministers; the motion relates to the suspension of Standing Orders. Honourable members are aware that this is a device which can be used at any time. It is a device which has been used extensively by the Opposition in the past, and I have no doubt that the Opposition will endeavour to use it in the future. In other words, the motion we are discussing relates to the running of the business of the House and not the appointment of Ministers. This latter issue will arise only when a statement is made in relation to it. I appreciated the humour of the last speaker who introduced a light touch in his concluding remarks when referring to the duties of Assistant Ministers, but he does not know and he has no authority to state what those duties will be. The position is that if and when Assistant Ministers are appointed their duties will have to be decided in accordance with the Standing Orders. This matter would not be determined until the Standing Orders Committee had had an opportunity to consider the matter and to bring its recommendations to this House. So what the honourable member has said is not accurate because at this point of time he does not know what will happen, and at this point of time. I do not think any of us knows what will happen - no r will we know until the matter has been brought to the Standing Orders Committee, debated by the Committee and a recommendation brought to the House. 1 should like also to draw attention to the point put by the honourable member that an unlimited number of Assistant Ministers could be appointed. He knows that this is the situation so far as Ministers are concerned not only in this Parliament but also in practically every Parliament in the world which has a democratic system. In most parliaments in the world there is no limitation on the number of Ministers or, as in this case, Assistant Ministers that can be appointed. This is a question of judgment, lt is quite foolish, although perhaps humorous, to say that we could appoint everyone as a Minister or Assistant Minister. This situation has always applied here and there has always been throughout the history of our Federal system the opportunity to appoint Assistant Ministers, I can speak with some feeling on this matter because for about 9 years I was what was first termed a parliamenary under-secretary and later a parliamentary secretary. I am sure that many honourable members now in the House will recall that. At that time we were not sworn of the Executive Council. I know that the Prime Minister at that time had been giving consideration to the matter and that there was very careful cussion of whether parliamentary secretaries should be sworn at the Executive Council. It just happened that at that time in 1961, as the last parliamentary secretary, I was appointed to the Ministry and so the matter was dropped. The procedure we are discussing is not an unusual procedure; it is a procedure which applies in many countries. But this is not the time to debate this point; the issue before the House is the suspension of the Standing Orders, the suspension of Standing Orders being in this instance designed to take out of the hands of the Government the business of the House. We have a blue paper setting down the business proposed for the day. We have a time at which we would expect, in the order of procedure, the Prime Minister to make a statement.",27
65,Mr COPE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I rise to order. Is the Minister suggesting that we are not entitled to move for the suspension of Standing Orders?,28
66,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do not know what the Minister is suggesting. That is a question that the honourable member might ask him.,28
67,Mr COPE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I am asking the Minister whether he is suggesting that we cannot suspend Standing Orders.,28
68,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member is out of order in asking the question of anybody at the moment and he should not interrupt the Minister while the Minister is on his feet.,28
69,Mr SWARTZ,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I mentioned earlier what the Standing Orders allow and the fact that the suspension of Standing Orders has been moved is an illustration that it can be done. The mover and seconder of the motion have spoken already and now I have had the opportunity to say a few words. Seeing that we have heard 2 speakers from the Opposition I hope that there will be an opportunity for another speaker to be called from the Government side of the House. T reiterate that it is the suspension of Standing Orders only with which we are dealing, and not the substantive matter.",28
70,Mr TURNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," There is a matter still to be resolved. Item 39 on the notice paper is dis- 'Assistant Ministers-Appointment-Minis terial Statement-Motio n to Take Note of Paper'. That debate has not yet occurred. On the other hand, I understand that there have been statements in the Press, which of course has taken over the role of Parliament these days, that Assistant Ministers are to be sworn in this afternoon. 1 do not believe that these Assistant Ministers should be sworn in until Parliament has had an opportunity, in terms of this motion on the notice paper, to discuss the whole matter. Surely it is essential that Parliament should know precisely what the constitutional position is, what kinds of alterations should be made to the Standing Orders and, above all, what are to be the functions of the Assistant Ministers. I have no wish that we should proceed with a debate on this matter immediately, suspending the Standing Orders for the purpose, if I can have an assurance from the Leader of the Government (Mr Swartz) that these people will not be sworn in until Parliament has had an opportunity to debate this motion. This is my simple point: I do not want to be forced into the position of voting for the suspension of Standing Orders simply because no assurance is given that these people will not be sworn in until the Parliament has had an opportunity to debate the matter. I speak from an entirely objective point of view. Assistant Ministers, if we are to have them, obviously should be young men with a prospect at some stage of going into the Ministry, this being a kind of apprenticeship. At my age, clearly I have no interest in this matter personally. I speak only because I believe that Parliament should fully discuss this whole question in the light of what the Government can say about the need for these people, their functions, how they can be integrated into the system having regard to constitutional difficulties and so on. When these matters have been cleared by debate I would be happy for appointments to be made, if the House is in favour of this being done, but not that they should be sworn in this afternoon and the debate come on perhaps by Christmas time. I do not think that this is the way that things ought to be done in a Parliament that takes itself seriously.",28
71,Mr WHITLAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," I rise in this debate merely to say that if the Leader of the House gives the undertaking sought by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Turner), namely that the honourable members named by the Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) in a statement outside the House will not be sworn of the Executive Council until the House has been given an opportunity to vote on order of the day No. 39, the motion that the Standing Orders be suspended will be withdrawn.",29
72,Mr JESS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS, I agree wholeheartedly with what the honourable member for Bradfield said.,29
73,Mr DUTHIE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,You missed out.,29
74,Mr JESS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"It is not a matter of missing this stage. out. Let it be understood that I let it be known that I did not want to be one of them. Honourable members opposite have raised a question of parliamentary prinSome ciple but when someone from this side rises to support them all they are prepared to do is mock him. What I am trying do is make known that I have the utmost respect for those who are to be appointed but I think that the Parliament, as a matter of principle, must be given the right make an assessment of the proposal with full knowledge of what is proposed and what powers are to be given to these people. I do not think it would be right for this proposal to become a fait accompli. I agree with the principle which I thought the Opposition was propounding but for honourable members opposite to mock everybody from this side who gets up to speak, claiming that we are suffering from sour grapes, does nothing for the standing of Parliament in the community. I say to those who arc so quick to mock someone else that if they ever have the gumption or the courage to stand and speak in this debate I will not mock them. I ask the Leader of the House for the assurance sought by the Opposition that nothing will be done until this matter is put in a proper form and agreed on by this Parliament. I think this is the essential issue and that it is not one of personalities or whether I or someone else should have been appointed. It is a question of the power of the Parliament and how this Parliament is to be treated.",29
75,Mr KELLY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS, I want to make my position clear in a few short words. At my age I do not think anyone is likely to toss at me the accusation that I suffer from sour grapes. I think the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Turner) is quite right when he says that this is a matter that ought to be decided before the people concerned are sworn in. I have an overwhelming admiration for most of the people involved. 1 think it is most unfair to put them in a position where their duties and their position in the House are not known to them. It is wrong for them to have to assume responsibilities and duties about which they know nothing. Because this House has not expressed its po'nt of view on this matter I also ask the Leader of the House for an assurance that this matter will not be proceeded with at,29
76,Mr SWARTZ,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"by leavequestions have been put to me in this debate and 1 think I should try to make the position clear. I have been asked to by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) and also by some honourable members on my side of the House to give an assurance in relation to deferring to appointments to the Executive Council a until this matter has been debated in this House. Unfortunately as the Leader of the House my job is to look after the business of the House. As I said earlier in this debate the question of ministerial appointquestions ments in our system has been the prerogacontinue. tive of the Prime Minister and the same principle applies with respect to the matter under debate. It is true that an additional Minister to be appointed, as honourable members know. The Prime Minister has indicated his intention to appoint some Assistant Ministers. This will not break the tradition of this Parliament because Assistant Minisis ters have been appointed previously and 1 mentioned not only have Assistant MinisGeneral ters been appointed in the past but also parliamentary secretaries who have carried out similar duties. This is a matter which is within the competence of the Prime the Minister. The reaction of the Opposition and also of some of our own members has been referred to the Prime Minister. I believe, as everyone does, in the prerogaby tive of Parliament and the Constitution. this case this is something which refers to the constitution of the Executive and the appointment of personnel to the Executive. It is beyond my capacity to make any decision as to whether an assurance should be given. In the circumstances it is not question that I can answer. The only assurance I can give is that Prime Minister has been advised of the feelings of the Opposition and especially the feelings of some of our own memMinister's bers-that this matter is one which should be the subject of debate in this House before appointments are made. The objecfor tions of the Opposition appear to relate Assistant Ministers but there is in statement made by the Prime Minister indication that an additional Minister be appointed. Can I take it from the Leadthem er of the Opposition that his Party is not objecting in any way to the announcement regarding the appointment of an additional Minisler to replace one of the previous Ministers?",29
77,Mr WHITLAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes .,30
78,Mr SWARTZ,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,And that the Opposition's objection is basically related to the he appointment of Assistant Ministers? Mr Whitlam-Solel y to the Assistant Ministers.,30
79,Mr SWARTZ,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Unde r the circumstances and having obtained an answer to those I think that the debate should,30
80,Mr HUGHES,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," I feel I should participate in this debate on one aspect of the issues that have been raised. is Some suggestion has been made that the proposal to have the Assistant Ministers sworn of the Executive Council so that they make undertake the duties to be placed upon them is unconstitutional. That the suggestion, as I understand it, that as has been made. When I was the AttorneyI had occasion to consider very fully the question of the constitutionality of the appointment of Assistant Ministers. I considered the matter myself and I had benefit of the advice of senior officers in the Attorney-General's Department. I think I should tell the House that I am quite satisfied that the proposal announced the Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) In during the last session is perfectly constitutional having regard to the duties which it is proposed should repose in these honourable gentlemen. I think that ought to be said because one does not want any doubts being lightly bandied about on such a a serious question. In view of my legal opinion on this subject. I must support the right of a Prime Minister to obtain the the assistance of honourable gentlemen and to have them sworn as members of the Executive Council. I do not question the Prime right to do that. If he thinks that that is an effective way of adding to the resources available to government, I one would not wish to part company to from him on the topic. I think that all the honourable members would be at one in an expressing the view that the gentlemen is to selected for the offences proposed for",30
81,Mr WHITLAM,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, I rise to order. I submit to you that the only matter for determination is that of suspending Standing Orders so that there can be a debate and a vote on order of the day No. 39. I am interested in what the honourable member has said and I respect what has said, but I believe that it is irrelevant to the motion to suspend Standing Orders. What he has said would be highly relevant to the debate on order of the day No. 39; it is not relevant to the debate on the suspension of Standing Orders to permit a debate on order of the day No. 39.",30

Mr Speaker, I shall not canvass your ruling. I support the Prime Minister's right to do what he proposes to do, but 1 must say- 4 think I ought to express my view so that it will be known by those who have to make a decision on the matterthat I incline very strongly to the view that it would be a gracious way of dealing with the problem if the House were allowed to debate the substantive matter. I am sure that the Prime Minister would be the last person who would wish to give any ground for thinking that he was being discourteous to this House, or to our collective will. I offer that view tentatively and with some hesitation, but I thought I ought to say what I have said.",31
84,Mr MCMAHON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," I thank the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Hughes) for his comments. I draw attention to the fact that in this House on 29th April 1971 I put down a statement relating to the appointment of Assistant Ministers. I then set out what their functions and role would be. I also stated the constitutional position as it has been developed by the honourable member for Berowra. I assure the House that the basis on which I prepared that paper was the letter which the honourable member wrote to me informing me of the constitutional position and that the way in which these Assistant Ministers would be appointed and would operate would not be a violation of the consitutional position in any way whatsoever. In other words, the advice which the honourable member gave was accepted by me and is the basis on which the statement was made. Nonetheless, in deference to the wishes of honourable members, if they wish to debate the matter in full I shall make arrangements for the debate to take place this afternoon, if that is desired. If that is the wish of the House the Leader of the House (Mr Swartz) will take the appropriate measures, and then immediately after lunch this matter can be fully debated. I hope that that assurance will satisfy honourable members. I hope that in the meantime they will read the statement. I made on the date I have mentioned. I particularly hope that they will remember what 1 said in the party room when no objection whatsoever was taken to the proposition.",31

94,Mr DOBIE,COMMITTEE,"The one hundred and twenty-ninth report relates to the Treasury minute on your Committee's one hundred and nineteenth report which referred to the supplementary report of the Auditor General for 1968-69. The one hundred and thirtieth report relates to the Treasury ute on your Committee's eighty-fourth report which referred to expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund 1965-66. Honourable members will recall that when I tabled the one hundred and sixteenth report of the Public Accounts Committee in May last year I outlined the history, purposes and arrangements relating to the Treasury minute procedure. I said at that time, and I repeat now, that your Committee believes the Treasury minute arrangements have proved their value over the years as an important element in ensuring that, through your Committee, the Parliament maintains an important and significant role in the financial administracreditors. tion of the Commonwealth. The reports that I am tabling today afford further proof of that view. One particular feature of the Treasury minute procedure to which I would draw the attention of honourable members relates to the fact that in reporting a Treasury minute to the Parliament your Committee, acting on behalf of the Parliament, reserves the right to make comment on the Treasury minute, as it thinks necessary. Such comments, taking the form of Committee observations, are included as the final chapter of the Treasury minute report. In this regard your Committee has not seen a need to make comment on the Treasury minute relating to the one hundred and nineteenth report. It has seen a need, however, to make 2 comments on the Treasury minute relating to the eightyfourth report. The first comment to be made relates to an inadequacy of evidence tendered under oath to the Committee regarding a feasibility study proposed for the High Commissioner's Office in London in 1966 and thought to have been abandoned. Without the benefit of the Treasury minute arrangement the full facts of this matter would not have been made available to your Committee. The second matter concerns an interpretation of a matter of principle. This principle relates to the important question of whether, and in what circumstances, departments should seek out their creditors. In its eighty-fourth report, your Committee drew particular attention to the failure of some Departments to seek out their creditors, the reasons being set out at some length in the one hundred and thirtieth minreport now being presented. Although the minute prepared by the Department of the Treasury on this matter may suggest some disagreement with your Committee's conclusions, your Committee is satisfied that its views and those of the Treasury coincide. In fact your Committee agrees that if supplies have been satisfactorily provided and there is an abnormal delay in the receipt of a claim for payment, it would not be a distortion on the natural course of events for a supplier to be informed that his claim had not been received. Indeed it was such a situation that led your Committee in its eighty-fourth report to refer to the need for Departments to seek out their I commend the reports to honourable members.

95,Mr SINCLAIR,INDUSTRY,"by leave-The Treasurer (Mr Snedden) announced in the Budget Speech provision for deficiency payments, if required, to give wool growers an assured return during the 1971-72 season. Legislation to establish detailed conditions for the payments will be introduced into the House in the near future. In the meantime to remove uncertainty it is appropriate that I furnish the House with further particulars of what is intended. The course of wool prices in 1970-71 gave the Government cause for grave concern. In the previous year returns from sales of greasy wool had fallen drastically. This was compounded by severe drought in extensive areas of Australia. Seasonal conditions improved somewhat in 1970-71 but wool prices continued to fall, attaining an average price of only 29.34c per lb, the lowest point in 24 years. Taking into account the considerable increases in costs over the period it was in real terms a far lower price than that which growers were receiving 24 years earlier. In these circumstances it was necessary to consider what action was needed to assist farmers because of low wool prices. I say 'farmers' advisedly because most wool growers-othe r than some in the pastoral zone-deriv e part of their income from other enterprises such as beef cattle, mutton, Iamb, wheat and coarse grains. For a large segment of the farming community wool price is an important determinant of income. Indeed out of Australia's 200,000 odd farm enterprises about 90,000 run more than 200 sheep. Last year at this time returns from wool declinded to the point where it was decided to provide up to 530m by way of special emergency assistance. This was made available to wool growers earning more than one-third of their income from wool and suffering not less than an 8 per cent fall in their gross returns from wool below the previous year. In the event wool growers received some $21.3m, an average of over SI,000 for each person meeting the conditions. The 1970-71 wool selling season opened before this scheme was put into effect and shortly after the opening prices fell to 28c per lb greasy. It was in this context that the Australian Wool Commission was set up to even out fluctuations in the market. It commenced operate on 16th November 1970. The for Commission, after a short period when prices firmed a little, was confronted with a further weakening in demand from Janper uary to June 1971 it therefore held its reserve prices firm at around the December closing levels. Early in 1971, following an urgent examination of the need for reconstruction in primary industries, the rural reconstruction scheme involving the provision of SlOOm over 4 years was introduced. In this year's Budget S40m of this allocation has been made available for the respective State administrative authorities for debt reconstruction and farm buildup purposes. For some farmers this provision will offer a way out of present difficulties. The extent of the problem in the industry is best demonstrated by the marked decline in farmers' wool income. Gross returns from wool fell from $839m in 1968-69 to $547m in 1970-71. Four out of the last 6 years have been ones of low income and for many associated with the industry accumulated debts are now imposing an impossible burden. During 1970-71 about 50,000 of the 90,000 wool growers were estimated to have had less than $2,000 net farm income from which to live after servicing their debts. The critical income situation affects not only these wool growers but also the approximately 1 million people who are wholly or partly dependent on the wool industry in various ways. The best advice available to the Government suggests that some improvement can be expected in wool prices. Accurate prediction is virtually impossible because of the many factors having a bearing on price. The recent action by President Nixon to protect the United States' economy has introduced a new and complicating factor in consideration of prices and demand for wool in the 1971-72 season. Nevertheless, there has been evidence that the general recession in the whole of the textile industry is passing and trade assessments continue to suggest an improvement in wool purchases in the coming year. In these circumstances, the Government has decided to supplement market returns on wool, to the extent that may be necessary, by deficiency payments. In this way growers will receive on all shorn wool, other than specified types of inferior wool, to a return corresonding to an average prices the whole clip of 36c per lb greasy for 1971-72. In metric terms, which are now to be used in the wool trade, this is 79.37c kilo. This price is significantly above the closing level of the market at the end of the 1970-71 season but on the other hand is capable of being reached if the market recovers. The position of the wool industry will again be reviewed of demand and prices ruling towards the end of this financial year. Honourable members will be aware that at this level of prices, extensive industry adjustments will still be needed. The assistance to be provided is considered to be the minimum required to provide some counter to the present very serious situation. A return of 79.37c per kilo average will offer a reasonably firm base for immediate planning by producers and others associated with the industry. More generally this assistance will provide the much needed breathing space to enable adjustments to take place without the economic and social disruption which would otherwise occur. It will give time to see what does happen to the market for wool. In addition, it will allow some settlement of unsecured debts in rural communities very dependent on servicing the wool industry. It is quite unrealistic to suggest that the deficiency payments scheme will impede or hinder the rural reconstruction scheme by encouraging people to stay on their properties who have no long term prospects of viability. The number of people who unfortunately will have to leave the industry even at the assured price levels is such as to present a reconstruction task as large as is manageable in one year. Certainly decisions affecting the permanent future of those who can carry on with only a modest price increase should not be made on the basis of price levels which we all hope are temporarily depressed below the long term trend. It is with these factors in mind that I would like to outline some details of the operation of the deficiency payments scheme. It is intended that use will be made of the existing facilities of the Australian Wool Commission which, as agent of the Commonwealth, will assist in distributing payments to wool growers through the agency of brokers and private wool merchants. Wool of certain inferior types amounting to about 10 per cent of the clip will not be eligible for deficiency payments. These inferior types frequently are not in strong demand and if they bore the full costs of handling and marketing would sometimes be sold at a loss. With the concurrence of honourable members. I incorporate a list of the inferior types in the light which will be excluded. NA List ot Inferior Types Excluded from the Scheme 1. Very burry carbonising merinofleece,pieces and bellies. 2. Merino carbonising lambs. 3. Merino stained pieces and bellies. 4. Merino carbonising locks. 5. Merino carbonising crutcbings. 6. Merino carbonising wiggings and eye pieces. 7. Merino plucked and dead. 8. Merino black wool. 9. Brands. 10. Carbonising Downs and Shropshire wool. 11. Very burry carbonising cross bred fleece, pieces and bellies. 12. Crossbred carbonising lambs. 13. Crossbred carbonising locks. 14. Crossbred carbonising crutchings. 15. Crossbred stained pieces and bellies. 16. Crossbred carbonising eye pieces and wiggings. 17. Crossbred black. 18. Crossbred plucked and dead. Deficiency payments will be based on a price schedule prepared by the Australian Wool Commission for the various types of wool sold which would give an average of 79.37c per kilo over the whole season for the full clip. The total return for the 90 per cent of the clip which attracts deficiency payments will therefore average somewhat in excess of 79.37c per kilo. Several honourable members have asked me just what the return is. If we take it in non-metric terms, on 90 per cent of the wool the average return will be 38.91c per lb. Following each week's auction the Commission will calculate the average price for all eligible wools sold at auction during that week. For the same group of wools it will calculate the price which these would have brought if the prices in the schedule had applied, that is, if the full clip were to average 79.37c per kilo over the year. The Commission will convert the difference between these prices into the percentage by which the actual weekly average price received would need to be increased to bring it to a level equivalent to the average of 79.37c per kilo over the year for the full clip. The deficiency payment wili be this percentage applied to the gross proceeds from eligible wool sold at auction during the week. In appraising the wool offered at auction the Commission wil] have indicated the lots of inferior wool which will not be eligible for deficiency payments. The broker on being notified by the Commission of the percentage deficiency payment will calculate for each client the deficiency payment on the eligible wool, and make the payments. Similar arrangements will apply to wool sold privately. Deficiency payments will be made to growers through private wool selling merchants. The payments will be based on the percentage determined by the Commission from wool sold at auction for the week in which the private sale took place. Where there is a recess in the auction gramme the percentage calculated for the last auction week before the recess will apply until auctions recommence. The percentage will be applied to the ex-farm price. For privately sold wool there is the problem that appraisement by the Commission of excluded wools would not be possible without undue interference with the trade. Accordingly, the private treaty chants will have the percentage deficiency payment reduced to take account of excluded wools, by an amount calculated on each sale, which will depend on the average price of the wool sold. The proportion of the sale value of the wool which will attract a deficiency payment will be calculated so that in broad terms the same result will be obtained as if the wool had been appraised by the Commission and the inferior types excluded. There will be a necessary amount of documentation to ensure that only wool growers receive benefit of deficiency payments, that double payments are not made on any wool and that the sale proceeds on which deficiency payments are based are the true proceeds. Each wool grower will need to sign a form attesting the price paid for his wool at a sale outside auction. For some direct sales to manufacturers and for exports the Commission will need to appraise each lot of wool and the deficiency payment will be based on the average market price for the eligible wool and the relevant deficiency payment percentage. The intention is that all wool traders who are to pass on deficiency payments will be registered. Such persons will need to agree with the Commonwealth to comply with the arrangements of the scheme and to pass on to the wool grower or his agent his entitlement to the deficiency payment. Wool exported on sheep skins constitutes an important part of our overseas trade wool. The Government considered the possibility of extending deficiency payments to this wool but has decided that as sheep skins are a separate product from wool they should be excluded from the scheme. In this situation deficiency payments may provide some inducement for growers to shear before sale of sheep. The incentive to do so will depend upon the course of the wool market. Should there be a substantial change in the supply of sheep skins pro- with full wool, the Government may need to consider some action to take this into account. Wool derived from the fellmongering process, buyers samples, dealers wool, buyers resales and commission resales will also be excluded from deficiency payments. The wool industry has in recent years become increasingly geared to electronic mer- data processing in the calculation of accounts. There will be some delay while these facilities are reprogrammed to allow for the deficiency payments scheme. I am confident that for those in desperate circumstances, the broking houses and other suppliers of credit to the wool industry will take into account the additional payment which will be forthcoming. It is expected that the payments will commence in October. These will include all deficiency payments due up till that time whether sale is by auction or by a private dealer. From then on they will be made on a current basis. After a thorough investigation of the position regarding disposal of wool by producers in the current fiscal year, it bas been decided that equitable treatment between growers would be best served by having the scheme run from 2nd July 1971 to 30th June 1972. Any wool sold and delivered by a producer in this period will be eligible for a deficiency payment. The percentage which will be used to calculate deficiency payments on wool sold privately prior to the opening sale of the 1971-72 season will be that applying to wool sold at auction in the first week of the new season. Earlier in this statement. I referred to the fact that wool exported direct by growers would need to be appraised by the Commission. Where wool has already left the country, if it is to be eligible for a deficiency payment it will be necessary that arrangements be made with the Commisin sion where possible for appraisement as to type and value overseas. Unless suitable arrangements can be made it will not be possible to make a deficiency payment on such wools. Wool growers would have little to gain by attempting to take advantage of the scheme by shearing and delivering wool before the normal time. Prematurely shorn wool in normal trade practice is discounted in price and this would offset the apparent benefit. This aspect moreover will be kept under review, and should it appear necessary to avoid advantage being taken of the arrangements in this way appropiate adjustments will be made to the scheme. The assured return to producers will be a combination of two elements, the price paid in the market and deficiency payments. As I have already announced,, the Australian Wool Commission will continue to be supported by the Government in its market operations on the same basis as in the past season. As in 1970-71, the Government will advance funds for the purchase of wool by the Commission, and against possible losses. Provisions totalling $14m have been made in the Budget for these purposes to be kept under review in the light of experience and regular reports by the Commission. The Government has agreed that the inferior wools excluded from deficiency payments will also be excluded by the Commission from its reserve price arrangements. In 1970-71 the administrative costs of the Commission were met in part by a contribution from the Australian Wool Board towards the cost of the price averaging plan and partly by a repayable Commonwealth Government loan. For this year, as provided for in the Wool Commission Act, a charge which is expected to be of the order of 0.4 per cent of the gross proceeds from the sale of wool will be made on growers to cover the Commission's administrative costs. The Commission's costs of administering the deficiency payments scheme on behalf of the Commonwealth will, however, be met separately by the Government. As I said earlier, the measures outlined above are only part of the Government's comprehensive approach to the social and economic problems of rural industry. In addition to present measures the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr The Lynch) will be shortly announcing a attention scheme for the retraining of persons displaced from rural industry. It is confidently believed that the deficiency payments scheme will encourage confidence and help to re-establish the flow of money which has been interrupted by uncertainty in country areas. It will tend to avoid precipitate action by lenders to realise on their securities. Indeed the whole question of credit is of increasing importance to the rural industries and there are clear indications of a need to re-examine the demand for, and supply of, credit in the rural sector. In these circumstances I have asked for the advice of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics on the adequacy of existing credit facilities. The Government is not happy at the necessity to introduce a deficiency payments scheme for wool. This is an industry with a long tradition of standing on its own feet meeting the fluctuations of the market place. The export income earned by this industry over the years has enabled the development of secondary and tertiary industries and has been of immeasurable benefit to our economy. In the past Australia has indeed 'ridden on the sheep's back'. Now the industry faces a crisis. While there is reason to hope for improvements in prices above the present disastrously low levels, the development of the synthetic fibre industries around the world means that today wool as a textile fibre faces different and more intensive competition than ever before. Substantial re-structuring and re-adjustments in the industry are inevitable. The purpose of the one year deficiency payment scheme is to provide some cushioning of the effects of the price decline so that the re-structuring can take place in a more orderly manner than if the full effects of what can reasonably be considered to be over depressed price levels are allowed free play. In the same way as the full effects of overseas price trends are moderated for our secondary industries in appropriate circumstances by a measure of tariff protection, so it is necessary and justifiable this year, in the judgment of the Government, to provide the wool industry with the assistance represented by the scheme of deficiency payments which I have outlined.",32
96,Dr PATTERSON,DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS FOR WOOL,"by leaveHouse has listened in silence and with to what the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) bas said. This is another example of hastily ill-conceived and patchwork decisions. It is heavily weighted in favour of the rich wool producer at the expense of those wool producers who need help and who have a legitimate claim to help and financial assisare tance because of the disastrous rural policies of this Government. The Opposition fully acknowledges the urgency of providing financial assistance to the wool industry, but it will support only a proposition which distributes government or public moneys to those producers who genuinely need help. The present proposal of the Government is a living example of the injustice and inequity of Liberal-Country Party philosophy, blatantly giving money to the rich and deliberately discriminating against the small farmer or the big farmer who genuinely needs help. I will not and I believe that my Party, the Australian Labor Party, will not be a party to giving public finance to men whose gross incomes are in the vicinity of S50.000, $100,000 or more per annum. Even in this House we have men who arc reputed to be millionaires, who have assets worth millions and who will receive financial assistance under this proposal. It is estimated that Sir Philip MCBride, a great friend of the Liberal Party, would receive something like $30,000 from this proposed measure. A person who runs 50,000 head of sheep, for example, would get $27,000 in cash under this agreement. This is a tragic travesty of Liberal-Country Party deceit: Fifteen per cent of the 90,000 wool growers produce 60 per cent of Australia's 2,000 million lb wool clip. follows that 15 per cent of the growers will receive 60 per cent of the subsidy. The subsidy will not amount to $60m as the Government is trying to hoodwink the people into believing. It could easily be at least Sl20m this year.",36
97,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS FOR WOOL,Do you object to that?,37
98,Dr PATTERSON,DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS FOR WOOL,"I will make my point clear in a moment. I object very strongly to your getting the subsidy and so does every person in Australia. If you could prove that you genuinely need the subsidy, as a small producer is required to do, then I would not object. The aim of the Government is to give the small producer almost nothing. The assistance that will be given to a man who has 1,000 or 2,000 head of sheep, will be virtually nil. This will force him off the land and force his family out of wool production forever. I can only draw the conclusion that the Country Party members in this Parliament very prosperous or they are out of touch with the rank and hie traditional small producer who is being discriminated against under this proposal. I feel very strongly for them.  every organisation of wool growers.",37
99,Dr PATTERSON,DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS FOR WOOL,I do not wish to go into personalities at all. We have seen- I think on an ABC television programmethe honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) driving to his office in a MercedesBenz.,37

101,Dr PATTERSON,DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS FOR WOOL,"I do not care about that. If he is entitled to a subsidy the Opposition will agree to it, but if he is not entitled to a subsidy we certainly will not agree to it. The Opposition will not support any subsidy which deliberately discriminates against those who need assistance amongst whom could easily be some large wool growers, in western Queensland, for example, there are scores of large wool growers who need help and they are entitled to it. But I will not be a party to giving the taxpayers' money to large pastoral companies who own large wool properties throughout Australia. T am told by the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Grassby) that Dalgetys has just made a It $5m profit, and yet under this proposal a large proportion of the public's money fhat will go to wool growers will have to go into Dalgetys' pockets. In actual fact a large proportion of this money will be transferred straight into the pockets of the private banking sector, the pastoral houses and the hire purchase companies. That will be the effect of the present proposal. It will not give to the traditional wool producer who genuinely needs financial help the assistance that he deserves. I repeat the figures I gave previously. Fifteen per cent of wool growers produce 60 per cent of the clip, and 15 per cent of wool producers will be getting 60 per cent of this money. The small producer who is the backbone of the country towns and who is supposed to be supported by the Country Party in this Parliament obviously is receiving no support at all, otherwise the Party that represents him would have objected to this proposal in the party room. The Minister for Primary Industry is attempting to interject. We heard him in silence. Obviously there must be a member of the Country Party in the Chair, otherwise the Minister would have been called to order.",37
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS FOR WOOL, I suggest that the honourable member for Dawson gives consideration to certain of the statements that he has been making.,38
103,Dr PATTERSON,DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS FOR WOOL,"I repeat that this financial assistance will be far greater than the $60m mentioned in the Budget, and every honourable member knows it, because this figure is based on an average price of 33c to 34c per lb, which is far more than the price being obtained today. I do not object to that at all providing money is put in the pockets of those people who genuinely deserve it. I submit that those producers who are entitled to this assistance, whether they be big or small producers, should receive it. But they have to prove that they are entitled to it. Just to give an across the board subsidy of 36c per lb is a travesty of justice. There are plenty of ways of obtaining this proof. One way of doing this would be simply to compare incomes. Plenty of suggestions have been put forward as the Minister well knows. The great bulk of producers and their families who are desperately in need of help are the backbone of the industry. If the Government adopts my suggestion the small traditional producer, the man who needs this assistance because of recent events, will receive a subsidy equivalent to not less than 40c per lb. Mr Irwin-He will still be in the same position this time next year.",38
104,Dr PATTERSON,DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS FOR WOOL,"Jus t a minute. The second urgent matter which has not been spelt out in this proposal is the Government's policy on reconstruction. We cannot depart from this principle. We must have the truth and the facts in this Parliament regarding the future of the wool industry. This is of vital importance. Perhaps the argument of the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Irwin) will prove to be correct, but we must have progressive reconstruction first. The principal objective of giving this money is not to degenerate the wool producers into the position in which the dairy industry finds itself at the present time. It is to help them get out of the industry, if that is the only answer, and to help them get out in a financal position. In all sincerity we cannot support any motion which does not give justice to those who deserve it most. I just cannot understand why the Government is to introduce legislation into this Parliament which will give the great percentage of the subsidy to people who still do not deserve it. I say again that if wool growers can prove financial hardship, they certainly should be entitled to the subsidy. But should the people who have amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets, reserves, shares, etc. be entitled to receive this subsidy? Are the lawyers and the professional men-the Collins Street and the Pitt Street farmers who are growing wool for the purthat pose of legitimately avoiding income tax entitled to receive the subsidy? There should be a moratorium on debts for at least 2 years so that when a wool grower and his family get their hands on this money, it is not immediately taken up by a court order instructing them to pay it over to Dalgety's or some other company or the private banks. It is not supposed to be for transfer from a grower to the private banks or any other sector of the community. It should remain in his hands so that he can help his family and help himself to reconstruct his property. That should be the purpose of this Bill. The Minister for Primary Industry did not say one word about acquisition. It is quite obvious that if this subsidy is to succeed there must be acquisition of the wool clip. This is the policy of the Australian Labor Party. It amuses me to remember that, when the Opposition suggested in the House early last year that the wool clip should be acquired, it was ridiculed by the Country Party and the Government. Now, of course, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) is going around the country preaching acquisition. The policy of the Labor Party is just that, with a controlled floor price. Our policy also takes into account the need to control production in relation to realistic market demands. This must be done as it has been done in the sugar industry. Also fundamental to the policy of the Labor Party is the effective distribution of money to those who need it most and to those who have the claim for it. The subsidy should go to those who have a justifiable claim for it, whether they are big producers or small producers of wool. The Government also could legitimately help the big producers of wool if it wanted to, by the correct procedure. For example, there could be a tariff compensation scheme to assist them against the penalties of the tariff. This is a legitimate economic argument; it is accepted by agricultural economists throughout the country. The Government can help them but this Bill is not the way to do it. What is concerning me greatly are these forecasts which are being constantly put forward-on e might say almost deliberately. We heard 12 months ago that, within the space of a couple of years, the wool price would rise by 10c a Ib. This was one of the arguments put forward by the Australian Wool Board, and, I regret to say, by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics as well. There is no evidence to support this. The international analyses of prices for acrylics, polyesters and nylons reflect the increasing efficiency of these industries. This is one of the factors which we must face up to, with rising costs. What Australia needs is a proper assessment of the future of wool, not the half baked schemes which are being put up by the Australian Wool Board or by other so called authorities. There are too many people involved in this. The wool producers, people in country towns, the workers, in fact all of us, are involved in this irrespective of whatever politics we might have. We want to know what is the real future of wool. We want to be told the truth. I do not belive that a reduction in wool production will increase wool prices significantly. 1 do not believe that, but I do not know. In other words, speaking in economic terms, I do not believe the elasticities are there. We must solve the problems-the physical and economic problems that we can solve-in other ways and it might even be to our advantage to increase wool production. This is the approach we must take.  this speech will.",38

106,Unknown,DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS FOR WOOL,"Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m. NA NA Ministerial Statement Debate resumed from 4 May (vide page 2477), on the following paper presented by Mr MCMahon: Appointment of Assistant Ministers-Ministeria l Statement, 29th April 1971 and on motion by Mr Swartz: That the House take note of the paper. Upon which Mr Daly had moved by way of amendment: That the following words be added to the motion: 'And expresses its disapproval of the decision to appoint Assistant Ministers'.",39
107,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,MINISTERS," I oppose the motion. I am a little disturbed by a lot of the things 1 read in the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon). I note that on 29th April the Prime Minister promised that he would be consulting the Presiding Officers to see whether an amendment of the Standing Orders was necessary to make the appointments in order that the Assistant Ministers could carry out to the full the jobs they are supposed to do. You, Sir, were perhaps a little tentative about it but the impression I gained from your reply to a question this morning is shared by the honourable members to whom I have spoken about the matter, including some honourable members opposite. The impression you gave me is that you believe that the Standing Orders Committee would have to meet and the Standing Orders would have to be altered before the Assistant Ministers could fully discharge their duties. But did the Prime Minister worry about the Standing Orders Committee? Did he worry about your opinion. Mr Speaker, on whether alterations to the Standing Orders were necessary? No. He charges in like a wildeyed mallee bull and decides to appoint these people to the positions. He does not care 2 hoots about the Standing Orders Committee of this Parliament and he does not care about you, Mr Speaker. He does not care about your opposite number, Sir Magnus Cormack, in the other place. Incidentally, Sir Magnus has had a few well chosen remarks to make about Assistant Ministers. He thinks it is a lot of nonsense, and says that so far as he is concerned he will refuse to recognise them. So how on earth Senator Marriott is to be recognised without a change in the Standing Orders of the Senate is beyond me. We all recall that Sir Magnus Cormack is now President of the Senate, very much against the Prime Minister's wishes. The Prime Minister tried his best to stop Sir Magnus getting there, but he did not succeed. This is anotner example of the Party's refusal to accept his dictates whenever there can be a private vote on anything. Now in the other place there is a Presiding Officer who does not believe that Assistant Ministers are necessary. He believes that they are unconstitutional. I would like to relate to the House some of the remarks made by the honourable gentleman who is now President of the Senate. He said: 1 can see Senator Cotton and Senator Wright wincing at this. Sir Magnus had just said that he did not think much of the idea of Ministers Senate. Probably there are people who would agree with that after having a look at some of the senators who now occupy ministerial positions. He went on: I am ready to put up with Senator Cotton Senator WrightIt appears that they are the only 2 Ministers there whom he is prepared to put up withbut I am not prepared to put up with a bevy Assistant Ministers in this place. Senator Withers, who was the Prime Minister's nominee for President, thought that he would get into it. He interjected: A bevy or a covey? That was apparently something special. Magnus Cormack said: A covey, I think. He accepted the amendment. Senator that Withers, the Prime Minister's 'pea', interreason jected again: Or a gaggle? That is nice, coming from a prospective President of the Senate. Sir Magnus mack replied to the interjection: A gaggle is another word, perhaps a whist snipe. I reject 'a pride of lions'. Senator Davidson, who was the Acting Deputy President, intervened and said: 'Order! I wish you would behave like senators and observe the decorum of the Senate. Please come back to the Bill.' So the senator who was later to become President then said: Do not worry, Mr Acting Deputy President, I have control of myself. In effect he said: 'Anybody who thinks I am under the influence of some other person must have another think coming.' In this dialogue-'whic h is a favourite word now-in the Senate on the question of bevies or coveys of Assistant Ministers the present President and the runner-up for the position of President were virtually agreeing that it is absolute nonsense to have these people as Assistant Ministers. How do you justify it? The Prime Minister said: T am justifying it because I want to prepare them for full ministerial status.' Good grief, Sir. Have a look at the people we are to get as Ministers in the near future. It will be the near future because the knives are out already. I was told by a prominent person- I will not say whether on this side or the other side of the chamber-that 3 more changes in the Minin the istry will be made this weekend. I invite honourable senators to have a look at who might take the vacancies. First and there is the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay). Goodness gracious. I do not know whether the Prime Minister thinks that this is a circus or a vaudeville show and wants to keep us all laughing or of in a state of rapt surprise. Fancy appointing the honourable member for Boothby, whose only claim to fame is that he has made 2 or 3 trips to South Africa at the expense of the South African Government, and to Rhodesia, and has come back breathing fire and brimstone in favour of Sir apartheid. Next is the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street). I will not dispute that appointment. I have often said he has great potential, but perhaps the he was appointed is not so much that he has great potential as it is that he happens to be a peison who believes in lowering the tariffs. We all remember how Corthe Prime Minister, at the time he was caught up with Maxwell Newton on behalf of of the Basic Industries Group, was plugging for something a little different from this. So perhaps this is the pay off to it appear that they are not quite as bad it was thought they were. The next appointment is the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Robinson). The honourable member for Cowper himself really thinks it is a joke because he stopped laughing ever since the appointwhere ment was made, and I do not blame him. do not blame the Prime Minister either who need not look so glum. We appreciate that it was his Deputy who made that appointment, but his are no better. The look on the Prime Minister's face seems indicate: ' I don't blame you for getting isfaction out of the fact that he is no good, but do not blame me.' That is what the Prime Minister's expression seems to imply, but his appointees are not a little bit better. Now I come lo the prize of all appointlast ments, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie). For 2 days after the Prime Minister attained the Prime Ministership the honourable member for Cook up and down the corridors of the House, listening for the paging system to call him to the Prime Minister's office. I did give him a call and said that he was wanted and he charged around to the Prime Minister's office. I got the girl to put through a call that he was wanted in the Prime Minister's office because I felt could safely anticipate such a call. I do know whether he went. I understood he heard the call, lf he heard it, I imagine that he would go around. But whom has the Prime Minister passed over? He has passed over the ourable member for Diamond Valley Brown). I dislike saying anything very laudatory about our friend, but whatever else he is, he is one of the brightest sparks on the other side. I tell the Prime Minister that, in case he has not noticed.",39
108,Mr MCMAHON,MINISTERS,] agree with you.,41
109,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,MINISTERS,"Bu the comes from Victoria and the Sydney Stock Exchange will not allow the Prime Minisexploits ter to appoint anybody from Victoria, am told. That is the reason, Now we come to the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles). Compared with the honourable recall member for Boothby, the honourable retary member for Angas would be a genius. It like comparing a giant with a political make pygmy to compare the 2 of them. But as why is he put aside? The reason that the Prime Minister would not have him prepared as a Minister is because he knows that the honourable member is a supporter of the former Prime Minister and he has not would not put himself in the position possible supporters of the former 1 Prime Minister would obtain authority or power. The Prime Minister has passed over the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Hamer), a very estimable person who, of course, unfortunately comes from Victoria. to Packer will not allow the Prime Minister satto appoint any Victorian without first getting the all clear signal. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Jarman) is a very estimable person. One of the finest brains on the Government side is the honourable member for Chisholm (Mr Staley). I said to the honourable member for Chisholm night that his maiden speech was excellent. He kept it on a very high level, and he ought to try very hard to maintain that level. He will find it difficult, but he was seen should at least try. We all know why this has been done. The Prime Minister wants to walk into his Party meetings, whenever there is a meeting, knowing that there are enougl of his appointees al the meeting who will always put up their hands for everything he puts I forward. He could not quite get that result not with the Ministers because there are only that 27. The Prime Minister thought he should make a few more appointments. He is like Jack Lang trying to get rid of the Upper House. Lang kept appointing honmore and more to the Upper House, but (Mr each time the members changed their minds just as the crunch came. That will be the Prime Minister's trouble. He may think that 6 Assistant Ministers will be sufficient to do the job now, but he will need another 6 in 6 months time. In the meantime, think of the havoc they will cause within the Ministry. I remember the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Swartz) proudly reminding us of his as Parliamentary Secretary. I so I remember those days. Had 1 been in his position I would have hoped that everyone would have forgotten about them. If I correctly, he was Parliamentary Secto the Minister for Trade, who was is Sir John MCEwen. He spent all of his time preparing questions to be directed to Sir John MCEwen in order to make him look as if he understood the subject. The honourable member would direct 2 or 3 questions a day to his own Minister. Why did he not question the Minister when he was in his office instead of wasting our time in the Parliament? Mr John Howse, a former member for Calare, was appointed as a Parliamentary Secretary. He was utterly fed up with the job of being a stamp licker. reminds me of what Mrs Newton, Maxwell Newton's mother, said. She said that was all the Treasurer (Mr Snedden) was fit for when he was working in the office of a legal firm in Western Australia. However, all Mr John Howse was asked to do was to lick the stamps for the girls who worked in the office of the Minister for External Affairs. He got out. He said: T will not have a bar of this. I will not demean myself by carrying on any longer.' Mr Bill Falkinder, a former member for Franklin, was another who held the position of Parliamentary Under-Secretary. He also got out. The only honourable member who stuck to the job, of course, was the present Leader of the House. The daggers are already drawn. The Ministers are now looking over their shoulders to see what the Assistant Ministers are doing. Of course, it is very nice for the Prime Minister to say: 'We need them because we want to reheve the Ministers of the need to come into the Parliament when the House debates some Bill which affects a particular Minister'. But what about the position of the shadow Ministers. Honourable members of the Opposition have no help at all. I do more work than any anticipated Minister.",41
110,Mr MCMAHON,MINISTERS,"Do you want some debated, help?",42
111,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,MINISTERS,"Yes, I do deal want some help. The only help I have received was on the occasion that Mr Speaker gave me some help which I the needed and could not have done without. But that help was taken away and I still without it. No-one can claim that not do as much work as any Minister, but I have to do that work with one typist. have no research officers; no assistance whatever. The Government should give to Her Majesty's Opposition's shadow cabinet some assistance before it creates these new this vein. positions of Assistant Ministers. I am reminded by one of my colleagues that when the present Leader of the House was a Parliamentary Secretary the newspapers at the time carried a cartoon that very admirably portrayed him. He was described as the 'abominable no man', because he had been trained by his Minister to say 'No'. The appointment of Assistant Ministers will make an absolute farce of the Parliament. But what does the This Prime Minister care? He is only a tiny little ineffectual man who knows that he can maintain control only while he is able to appoint enough lackeys and yes men to prop up his numbers inside the Party room. But the people of this country and the Parliament ought not to be concerned about propping up some ineffectual, tiny, funny little man who poses as Prime Minister.",42
112,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERS,Order ! The honourable member will withdraw those remarks.,42
113,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,MINISTERS,"I withdraw them, but that is how he looks to me. The proposal to appoint Assistant Ministers should be rejected. I hope that honourable members opposite, such as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) who looks so wise and who has been treated so shabbily, will realise that if they are to go down in history as men worthy of this Parliament they must stand now and be counted on the side of those who can see the shabby folly of it all. They must tell this Prime Minister that if he cannot govern by his own right, he ought not to use up the Parliament to do it for him.",42
114,Mr HUGHES,MINISTERS," 1 had that the Opposition, having expressed great anxiety to have this matter might have come into the House and put up a speaker who was prepared to with the subject as a serious subject. We have heard the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) describe Prime Minister as rushing around like a Mallee bull. All I can say to the honouram able member for Hindmarsh in that his I do contribution to the debate did not have any sort of Clydesdale quality about it. He I was content to clown, and it is perhaps a pity that a subject which we thought was be treated as a serious subject has been discussed by the honourable member in I regard the matter that has been raised in this motion-that the House disapprove the Prime Minister's decision to appoint Assistant Ministers-as one that raises serious questions of principle. There are two main questions. The first is the constitutional question. That has been raised by honourable members on the other side of the House. It was raised in the debate this morning. I sought an opportunity to talk on the constitutional position, but your ruling, Mr Speaker, prevented me from exploiting it. I want to say something very briefly about that in this debate because this is the appropriate time to say it. The second question, also a question of principle, is whether the Assistant Minister! ought to be appointed. Is their appointment likely to promote the dispatch of Government business? Is it likely to improve the quality of administration? I say quite unequivocally that if the Prime Minister wants to appoint these gentlemen to these new offices, it is his right to do so. It is he who has to make the judgment and take the responsibility. He has exercised his judgment. The responsibility for the succeess or failure of this renewed experiment will be his. He is confident that the step he proposes taking will improve the quality of the administration. I think that if the subject is to be treated seriously, the Prime Minister's decision, carrying with it the responsibility that I have described, ought to be respected by the House. To put it in plain language, the experiment should be allowed to start and the new system should be given a go. 1 do not think it is for this House to express by a vote any disapproval of the decision that the Prime Minister, as head of the Government, has made. That is my position quite clearly. Dr Gun-What are we here for then?",42
115,Mr HUGHES,MINISTERS,"On e might well ask. I am glad that the honourable member for Kingston has questioned what we are doing here debating this subject this afternoon. I would have thought that if the Opposition had any real dedication to getting the business of Government done and making its own contribution to the business of Government it would have seen to it that this afternoon was better spent than in debating his motion on the level at which the honourable member for Hindmarsh was prepared to debate it. I want to leave that part of the subject and go now to the constitutional position. One of my last tasks as Attorney-General was to tender some advice on the constitutionality or otherwise of the proposal to appoint Assistant Ministers or, as they might otherwise be called but are not being called, parliamentary under-secretaries. In examining this question of the constitutionality of the proposal, we should first of all bear in mind that this is no novel experiment. This course of appointing Assistant Ministers or honorary Ministers has been taken before. In the 1950s there were people called parliamentary undersecretaries. So, we are not dealing with something that has arisen now for the first time. We should take note of the fact that the only person who raised any question against the constitutionality of appointing gentlemen to assist Ministers of the Crown was Mr Speaker Cameron, who did so in 1952. Before he raised this doubt-perhap s it should not be called a doubt-nobod y else had raised the question. It was taken for granted that this was a perfectly constitutional proposal. I do not suppose Mr Speaker Cameron ever spoke so mildly as to express doubts; he was rather more definite in his views at all times. But when he raised questions in 1952 they were dealt with, and dealt with very fully and effectively, by the Prime Minister of the day, the then Mr Menzies. When I came to advise on this question in March, shortly before I left office, I considered the matter myself, I consulted with senior people in what was then my Department and I looked at the previous opinions and expressions of view. I came quite clearly to the conclusion, which I still hold without any doubt, that the appointment of Assistant Ministers-the y receiving no emolument for performing the duties they will perform-offend s against nothing in the Constitution and offends against no constitutional convention or principle. The plain fact is that these gentlemen, when they are sworn in as Executive Councillors, will have allotted to them duties which involve in no way the actual administration of a department. They will at most be deputies in relation to certain relatively minor matters. I say this not in any sense denigrating the positions they will occupy. They will be the express deputies of the Ministers whom they are appointed to help. Section 19 of the Acts Interpretation \cl provides for this sort of thing to happen and gives it legal sanction. It is important to observe that, so long as these gentlemen receive no salary for the duties they perform and receive no more than a recompense of their reasonable travelling expenses, no question of their disqualification from the Parliament will arise.",43
116,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,MINISTERS,"If they are members of the Executive Council, as is proposed, why cannot they be paid?",44
117,Mr HUGHES,MINISTERS,"Because if they were paid it could be said that they were occupying an office of profit under the Crown and that would entail disqualification the Parliament. So, to avoid the risk of disqualification it is clearly provided for the arrangements proposed by the Prime Minister that these gentlemen will receive no pecuniary reward for the services they will undertake. It is because of this, well as the other reasons I have endeaWe voured to express, that there arises doubt in my mind as to the perfect constiing tutional propriety of this proposal. I like to sum up the legal and constitutional position, as I see it and as I saw it when advised as Attorney-General, in this way: . . . a Member of Parliament not appointed to administer a Department of State(a) may be appointed to be a member Federal Executive Council under of the Constitution; A person does not have to be a member of Parliament or a Minister of State to qualify for appointment as an Executive Councarefully cillor; the decision or choice is that of Governor General of the day(b) may be designated by the Prime Minister be an Assistant Minister or a Minister without portfolio or a Parliamentary Under-SecretaryIt is merely a matter of terminologybut this does not make him a Minister State in the constitutional sense; (c) cannot be paid any emoluments in respect of his duties as a member of the Federal Executive Council or as Assistant Minister without portfolio or Parliamentary Under-Secretary, other than travelling expenses incurred in performing his duties; (d) may, as a member of the Federal Executive Council, exercise, on behalf of a Minister of Stale, if authorised to act on behalf that Minister, any statutory function Minister, by virtue of section 19 of the Acts Interpretation Act. This would include approving of appointments and performing other functions expressly conferred Minister by legislation; (e) may be a member of Cabinet and may make inquiries, conduct correspondence as authorised by the Minister of State whom he is appointed to assist and may receive deputations on behalf of that Minister. Those are the conclusions I reached. I stand by those conclusions. I hope that I have made a contribution to the debate that may be regarded as useful. I have tried to do that. I hope that the House, on this Friday afternoon, will try to discuss this subject on a serious level-that being the level of treatment it obviously deserves.",44
118,Mr UREN,MINISTERS,"There is no from question on this side of the House about the seriousness of this discussion. As far as in we are concerned, it is most unusual for the Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) to make a decision and then, because of the rebellion in the back bench of his Party, as have to stand up the Governor General. know that many honourable members no on the Government back benches, includthe honourable member for Bradfield would (Mr Turner), the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Jess), the honourable memI ber for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) and the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Hughes), refused to support the proposal now before the House unless there was a general of the debate on it. Now we are having that section 62 debate. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) has moved an amendment which I support. I am not a legal man, but 1 listened to the honourable member for the Berowra. It is most unusual for the Prime Minister to use the legal opinion of a man to whose opinion he does not respect and whom he sacked and kicked out of the Ministry. Why does he not seek the opinion of the former Attorney-General, now the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr N . H. of Bowen), or obtain a statement from the present Attorney-General (Senator Greenwood)? With all due respect to the honourable member for Berowra, nothing that he Minister, said when giving his legal opinion is different from what was said by Mr Speaker Cameron. Mr Speaker Cameron said that the proposed positions represented offices of profit under the Crown of and, of course, the honourable member for of the Berowra bas expressed the same opinion. I want to see some balance brought into on the this Parliament if there is to be a democratic approach. Already we have 27 Ministers and a great deal of staff to support that Ministry. Now the Prime Minister wants to appoint a further 6. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) raised the question of the shadow cabinet on this side of the House. What about our responsibilities and our lack of services and staff to combat ministries which can draw on their complete staffs and the resources of their departments? Is this a fair go? Under this so called democratic procedure, how can we examine minutely the legislation before the House? It is not enough for the Government that we do not bave available to us the staff to enable us to enter into debates and compete with the resources on which the Government can draw? The Government now wants 6 Assistant Ministers. I have the responsibility on this side of the House for housing, urban affairs and the environment. Housing and the environment are dealt with by 2 Ministers, whilst in regard to urban affairs we know that this Government has no responsibility at all for the cities of Australia. It is not concerned about the cities of Australia. They can fall into squalor. However, because of this aspect alone, I suggest that these 6 Assistant Ministers should not be appointed. Parliament as a whole should be responsible for determining whether these appointments are necessary.",44
119,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,MINISTERS,They should not be appointed until we get some help.,45
120,Mr UREN,MINISTERS,The Opposition needs some assistance.,45
121,Mr MCMAHON,MINISTERS,"Can I put this to you? Is what you are putting to me that if I will give you some additional technical assistance to help you in the performance of your functions, you will withdraw the amendment?",45
122,Mr UREN,MINISTERS,"I am putting the point of view that you have denied members of the Opposition any right to a fair go. Our shadow Ministers, and even our back bench members, are not provided with suiiicient staff to enable them to examine legislation which the House is considering. Our needs command a higher priority than the need to extend the Ministry. However, the Labor caucus will examine the Prime Minister's suggestion. I cannot make a decision on it. The Labor Party has decided to support the amendment which was moved by the honourable member for Grayndler. I am arguing that the Prime Minister has not shown the Opposition consideration. One question that arises is whether there is some sinister purpose in appointing Assistant Ministers. Are they intended to buy off members on the back benches on the Government side? Is the appointment of the Assistant Ministers a move to defeat the possibility of the Liberal Pary caucus voting itself power to select the Ministry? Is this a move to quieten some members opposite or to extend the number of members of the establishment so that in meetings of the Liberal Party caucus there will be sufficient members of the establishment to quieten other members? These are matters which we must examine. I am trying to debate this proposal in a balanced a:id thoughtful way. Mr Speaker, I have just had handed to me from the Opposition front bench a note suggesting that I should accept the Prime Minister's offer of assistance. I do not know. Mr Chipp-Hav e a caucus meeting.",45
123,Mr UREN,MINISTERS,"No . This is now my responsibility. 1I have received a note from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) and, as far as I am concerned, he has made a decision, which is that we now accept the Prime Minister's offer.",45
124,Mr MCMAHON,MINISTERS,That is untrue. I made no offer. I asked whether you were putting an offer to me.,45

128,Mr UREN,MINISTERS,The great trouble with the Prime Minister is that he wants everything his own way. When he was not the Prime Minister he was the greatest leak in Cabinet. This is known by every Press man in the Press Gallery. Outside of this chamber the Prime Minister is known by members of the Press as 'Billy the leak'. The Prime Minister knows that.,45
129,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERS,Order ! The honourable member for Reid will withdraw those comments because they are definitely out of order.,45
130,Mr UREN,MINISTERS,"Mr Speaker, all 1 did was to repeat that the Prime Minister is known by Press men as 'Billy the leak'. I made no accusations about what he is.",46
131,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERS,Order l The honourable member may continue.,46
132,Mr UREN,MINISTERS,"I was only repeating what the Prime Minister was known as. He was known by this title because of the fact that when he was not the Prime Minister it suited him to telephone members of the Press and consequently it is now those Press men who are making the accusations, not me.",46
133,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERS,Order ! I would remind the honourable gentleman that the question before the Chair relates to a matter which is completely dissociated from what the honourable member is referring to now. I ask him to discuss the subject matter before the House.,46
134,Mr UREN,MINISTERS,"Mr Speaker, 1 wandered slightly from the matter under discussion because of interjections. After all, Mr Speaker, you are responsible for the conduct of this chamber and you allowed the Prime Minister to interject, contrary to Standing Orders, and I listened to him. In due course, the Leader of the Opposition gave me the responsibility of making a decision and, consequently, I accepted the proposition or the offer put forward by the Prime Minister. Now it seems that that was an irresponsible statement. The Prime Minister's decision to appoint Assistant Ministers is apparently to broaden the base of the establishment in the parliamentary Liberal Party to stifle his critics so that when the Liberal Party caucus comes to determine whether rank and file members of the Liberal Party should, in a democratic way, elect the Ministry and Cabinet any criticism of the Prime Minister will be stifled. I ask those critics on the back benches of the Government side to join with the Opposition in voting in favour of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Grayndler. Mr N. H. BOWEN (Parramatta-Minister for Foreign Affairs) (2.51)-We are debating a serious subject but the Opposition has attempted to turn it into an exercise in political mischief. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde CamerOn) increasingly is exhibiting not only an infinite capacity for mischief but almost a monumental malice. May I , in the most friendly spirit-to use his own technique-war n the honourable member that he is now carrying this style of his so far that he is getting close to becoming a caricature and the House is ceasing to take note of what he says. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) is not a small man in any sense, certainly not in my opinion, and I rather regret that to some degree he has joined the honourable member for Hindmarsh in this level of debate. I do not propose to debate this matter on that low level. Three simple issues are involved in this debate. The first is whether it is constitutionally correct to appoint Assistant Ministers in the manner proposed in the statement of - the Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) to the House. The second is whether the announcement of the Assistant Ministers to be appointed should have been made in this House instead of outside this House. The third is whether what is proposed in the statement is desirable or undesirable in the view of the House. As to the first issue, I agree with the legal advice which was given to the Prime Minister by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Hughes) on 18th March 1971 when he was Attorney-General. I should inform the House that when I became Attorney-General I considered that advice and T confirmed it in writing over my own signature. I do not think the House needs any great elaboration of the legal issues. The relevant part of paragraph 4 of section 44 of the Constitution reads: Any person who holds any office of profit under the Crown . . . shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. Put simply, the question is this: Would these Assistant Ministers forfeit their positions as members of this House or of the Senate, in the case of senators, because they hold an office of profit? Would they be holding an office of profit? Provided they do not receive any emolument it is my opinion that they would not. Perhaps that is simplifying it unduly but that, broadly, is basically and fundamentally the proposition. I do not think that they would be prevented from receiving a reimbursement of their out-of-pocket expenses. Provided they are not receiving a profit from their office there is no difficulty. Indeed, the practice of this Parliament since federation has been consistently to appoint men to such an office. It has not always had the same name, but if honourable members were to take the trouble of referring to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Handbook they would find that in Labor administrations and in administrations of this side of the House Assistant Ministers, Honorary Ministers and Ministers without Portfolio have been appointed. The name has changed from time to time but the concept has not. It has been the customary practice in this House. I do not stay to debate that quirk-that accidental happening-at the time when a particular Speaker ruled in this place in a manner which will be well within the memory of some honourable members The second issue is whether the announcement should have been made to this House. May I point out to honourable members that the appointment in question is not like the appointment of you, Mr Speaker- a parliamentary appointment-it is not an appointment within the gift of this House; it is an appointment by Her Majesty the Queen or her representative in Australia, the Governor General. What really is suggested by this proposition is that in some way the Crown's representative is at fault in not coming into the House in order to make the announcement. That basically is the proposition. Of course, the Crown acts on the advice of the Prime Minister in relation to ministerial appointments. Residual to the whole question may be the thought: 'Well, it would have been a courtesy to the House for the Prime Minister, who is advising the Crown, to come in'. That argument may be put. But at least one can say that in the past, because of the fundamental and basic position of these appointments, which are Crown appointments, it has been the practice to make an announcement outside the House. That is the current practice in Australia. It probably accounts for the fact that the names of those people who are appointed Ministers, Assistant Ministers or Honorary Ministers and sworn as members of the Executive Council are customarily announced outside the House. It is true that there is on the notice paper an item setting forth that the House take note of the paper setting forth the Prime Minister's statement to the House. An amendment has been moved by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) to the effect that the following words be added to the motion that the House take note of the paper: 'and expresses its disapproval of the decision to appoint Assistant Ministers'. It is true that that debate was stood over. Incidentally, there had already been two speakers from the Opposition on the amendment. It has been argued that the House should have been given an opportunity to debate this motion and the proposed amendment to it before the appointments were made. In view of the fact that they are appointments by the Crown and not by the Parliament it would be an idle debate, although it is a question on which one might have a debate. I do not propose to continue a discussion of this particular issue because the Assistant Ministers have not in fact been appointed. The House is in fact now debating a matter that the Prime Minister has-said it should debate this afternoon. He said: 'If the House wants a debate we will have one', and the House is now debating this matter. There is nothing left to argue about on the second issue; it has become simply a hypothetical question. That leaves the third issue, which is whether what is proposed is desirable. On this issue the House has the benefit of the views which have been set forth in the Prime Minister's statement that is the subject of the noting motion and the speeches of honourable members on the amendment to that motion and on the occasion of this debate.",46
135,Mr COPE,MINISTERS,"We would not have had a debate but for the rebellion and the Minister knows it. Mr N. H. BOWEN-If the honourable member for Sydney can restrain himself, I will address myself to the Chair and say that two matters weigh heavily in my mind. Firstly, I think that the business of government in the federal sphere has expanded enormously in the last 20 years. I do not think it is generally appreciated how great is the pressure of work upon members or Ministers. I do not think it is generally appreciated, for example, that they work a 7-day week. This proposal to give Ministers assistance and some relief is certainly a sensible proposal, as far as the business of government is concerned. The second matter is that the proposal, if implemented, obviously will give valuable experience to the younger members on the Government side, and if the House is looking at this matter honestly and dispassionately, it will concede that it is ultimately for the benefit of the nation that they should get this experience. There are other matters, but I do not propose to debate this question at length. 1 think one has to remember that ultimately the appointment of Ministers and Assistant Ministers lies with the Crown, advised by the executive government, and I think that one would have to have very substantial reasons to challenge the actions of the Prime Minister in a matter such as this. I am against the amendment and in favour of the motion which is before the House.",47
136,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTERS," Mr Speaker, there no need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr N. H. Bowen) to lecture honourable members on dignity and decorum in this matter. I do not believe that the Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) or the Ministry have any reason to be proud of the way in which they have treated you, Sir, or Governor General today. It was all, from your own demeanour this morning, that you thought there had been some of contempt for the Chair. Also, Sir, the fact that appointments were made for the his Governor General to swear in Assistant amendments Ministers, and an assumption was made with that the House would approve of a proceascertain dure concerning which there was already a notice on the Notice Paper, was an imperYou, tinence. Neither you nor the Governorthere General have been treated with decorum or dignity by the Prime Minister and whom he has appointed to his Ministry today. Sir, the question is not about the announcement of the appointment of Ministers being announced outside the reply House. Of course, it is perfectly proper and usual to announce appointments outgive side the House. The first Commonwealth Ministers, were appointed and their ter. appointment was announced before the Parliament was ever convened, or elected. The Constitution makes provision for Ministers to hold their positions for, up to 3 months before they are elected to the Parliament. There is a new situation, one which your predecessor, Speaker Cameron, brought to notice, concerning Assistant Ministers, Under-Secretaries and so on. It is true that in the first half century of federation governments always included such Ministers. For the last 19 years the whole question has been in abeyance. It is relevant to consider whether the announcement of sucb appointment should have been made before the House had determined the matter; whether, in fact, arrangements should have been made for the Governor General to swear the Assistant Ministers in before the House had disposed of the matter. I said this morning that I respected the view of the former Attorney-General, and I also respect the same view expressed by the first Attorney-General whom the present Prime Minister appointed. It is years I looked at this matter on the Constiis tutional Review Committee but I would not be disposed to dispute their view. There are 2 matters upon which I rise to speak. The first is that when the Prime Minister announced that he proposed to appoint Assistant Ministers, he did in fact the say, as T quoted during my question to clear to us you, Sir, this morning: . . . there are occasions when it would be great assistance to a Minister if his Assistant Minister could, during the Committee stages of a Bill, sit at the table of the House and represent Minister in the discussion of clauses and as they arise. I shall be consulting the Presiding Officers on this matter to whether, to achieve this, an amendment of Standing Orders will be necessary. Sir, said in your answer to me that would have to be a very considerable number of amendments to the Standing those Orders. Honourable members are only entitled to ask questions of you without notice. They cannot put them on the notice paper. A very usual procedure is for the Speaker to take the question without notice under notice and give a prepared later. It was quite clear this morning, from the fact that you were prepared to such an informative reply off the cuff, that you had seriously considered this matAccordingly, when you said that there would have to be many amendments to the Standing Orders to permit the practice which the Prime Minister forecast on 29th April, it was clear that you were of that sure opinion. Since that time there has been a change of Presiding Officer in the Senate. My colleague the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) quoted what the new President said about this very matter. I thought that the most amusing part of my colleague's speech was the quotation from the President, Sir Magnus Cormack. At least the House should take into sideration the circumstances in which any Assistant Ministers could function in the House. The Prime Minister clearly anticipated that this would be determined for both Houses. We know that the new President of the Senate is averse to the idea of Assistant Ministers. He accepts, because of its long standing, the practice of Ministers being members of the Senate. The second matter that I wish to raise arises from the interjection of the Prime Minister while my colleague the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) was speaking. The Prime Minister asked, if I recollect correctly, whether we would drop the amendment if assistance were",48
137,Mr MCMAHON,MINISTERS,I said: 'Are you putting the proposition to me?',49
138,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTERS,'Are you putting the proposition to me that if assistance were made available to the Opposition executive you would drop the amendment?' I authorised the honourable member for Reid to accept what I took to be an offer.,49
139,Mr MCMAHON,MINISTERS,Can I straighten this out? What you are saying is that you were putting to me that if I were prepared to let you have assistance you would let this go through without objection?,49
140,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTERS,Yes.,49
141,Mr MCMAHON,MINISTERS,"So you have no objection whatever, in terms of principle or on any other basis, to this paper and to the action now being taken by me. AH you want is to do a deal?",49
142,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTERS,"If assistance is made available to the Opposition executive this amendment will be withdrawn. The honourable member for Reid stated that on my authority. I reiterate it. I have not looked through what I said in the debate on the Ministers of State Bill, with which the proposal for the appointment of Assistant Ministers was associated iast April, but I believe that I said on that occasion that there was something inherently unequal and unjust in that Ministers and now Assistant Ministers were being appointed, with all the assistance that goes with those positions, whereas no more assistance was now available to the Opposition than there had been years ago. In fact I have discussed this with ihe previous con- 2 Prime Ministers and with the present Prime Minister. The situation simply is that a member who serves on the Opposition executive has to be, in the nature of things, away from his electorate much longer than other private members. Like any private member on either side of the House he has one secretary-typist available to him. There are members of the Opposition executive from north Queensland and Western Australia. The airline timetables make it quite plain that even when we sit on 3 days-Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday-suc h members can be in their electorates on the Monday morning only. If they are to use the services of their secretary-typists they have to do so by telegram or trunk line call. Furthermore, members of the Opposition executive have to resume the debate on any Bills and on any ministerial statements. Any Minister who makes a second reading speech or gives a ministerial statement does so from a typed text. Obviously it is easier for him to prepare his speech, to dictate it, to read it and to circulate it to the Press if he has secretarial assistance available to him. Members of the Opposition executive do not have such secretarial assistance available to them. The Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have such secretarial assistance, as have the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. The Whips on both sides of the House have such assistance. A secretary-typist is available to the Opposition Whip. I think this is the case for both the Government Whip and the smaller Government Party Whip. But I know that my own staff has to do very many things for my colleagues which it is unreasonable for them to do. But there is no alternative to their doing it. I would certainly think it is about time that we revived the system which is now about 25 years old under which private members have one secretary-typist. In the United States of America, in Canada-it is true that this is not the case in Europe-mem bers of Parliament have much more assistance available to them than that. We should have it in Australia. I am concerned at the moment, in the light of the Prime Minister's interjection, that members of the Opposition executive are unable to use their secretary-typists directly or nomically to the extent even that private members do. If this Parliament is to work properly and if democracy, is to be effective in Australia, there must be more parity of facilities between the ins and the outs. I appreciate that there would be anticipation on both sides of the House that the ins and the outs would reverse their positions at the next House of Representatives election. But I am putting this proposition in this way and at this time because 1 believe it is fair for whoever are the outs, for an Opposition whether it is the Australian Labor Party or the Liberal Party of Australia, to be entitled to more secretarial assistance in Canberra while Parliament is sitting for members of its executive than is at present available. The Assistant Ministers who are being appointed will all clearly have more secretarial assistance, presumably male and female.",49
143,Mr DUTHIE,MINISTERS,Where will they put them?,50
144,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTERS,"That is a matter for the Speaker to determine. It is clear that they will have more secretarial assistance. They may have Press secretaries and so on. That is the inevitable accretion of Parkinson's law, the one law in this country which does not have to go through Parliament. If the Prime Minister seriously puts this proposition then the Opposition accepts it.",50
145,Mr MCMAHON,MINISTERS,I did not say I put it. I wanted to find out from you whether were prepared to make a tawdry deal.,50
146,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTERS,"A few minutes ago it was a deal; it is now a tawdry deal. Sir, believe this is a perfectly proper suggesment tion. This Parliament does not work effectively as it should because those people who serve on the Opposition executive, and those who will serve on the Opposition executive after the next election, cannot and will not effectively work with the assistance available to them when the Parliament is sitting.",50
147,Mr MCMAHON,MINISTERS,"There is very little more to be said because already the Opposition has conceded the constitutional right of the Prime Minister to appoint Assistant Miniseco- ters to help Ministers of State in the administration of their functions. I do not think there is very much doubt in the minds of a great number of members of this House that, as political and parliamentary life becomes increasingly complicated, there is a need, particularly in the case of many senior members of Cabinet, to have a Minister assisting them to carry out their functions. 1 know from practical experience of many portfolios-probabl y as many as 14-that life today is much more complicated than it was when I entered Parliament, that Ministers aie working consistently and that they do need to have some of the burden taken off their shoulthis ders particularly so they may attend to constituency work. I also believe that it is highly desirable to give young and talented people the opportunity to learn the responsibilities of government and of administration, to know the tasks to be performed by Ministers, to get a greater acquaintance of the departments of State and the officials involved and, I believe, therefore to prepare themselves for promotion firstly to ministerial and later to Cabinet rank. I do not for one moment want to debate those subjects because I believe that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) has accepted the point of view put by my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Hughes) and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr N. H. Bowen), who was previously the Attorney-General. I turn to the poterMal or probable you amendments to Standing Orders. When I read to the House the proposed amendments I think everyone will concede that they are so inconsequential that I could I not believe that there could be any arguabout them. Let me mention firstly as the history of the matter. We did seek advice from the officers of the House as to what amendments might be made to Standing Orders if the Assistant Ministers were to carry out their functions mentioned in the statement that I made to the House on 29th April and that I subsequently published in the form of a White Paper. We received certain advice from the Clerk. For some considerable time negotiations continued with the Clerk until we did refine the Standing Orders that needed amendment. We are also deciding on those which we feel should be submitted to you, Mr Speaker, and which finally would be presented to the House for ratification. Let me mention them. The first related to standing order 32. That relates to the seating of Assistant Ministers in the House. Here the recommendation is a clear one. It is not desired that Assistant Ministers be allocated seats on the ministerial bench. However, it is felt that they should be permitted to be seated at the table when they are in charge of debates on legislation or other matters. Is that a matter of great substance? Is that a matter which should detain the House for 5 minutes? I doubt it, unless the people who are raising objections are people of a much inferior frame of mind than I think should be in the House. The second relates to the seconding of motions understanding orders 133, 160, 172, and 211. Normally a motion proposed by a member has to be seconded, but it has not to be seconded when it is proposed by a Minister. What is proposed on this occasion is that if a motion is proposed by an Assistant Minister it will not need to be seconded. Is there anything of substance here, anything we should argue about, or is it not something that should be agreed to automatically by all sensible and realistic people? The third relates to standing orders 235, 236, 238 and 239. The Standing Orders as at present drafted would not prevent Assistant Ministers from taking Bills through the House. It should be pointed out that, as there will be a change in practice, it should be made known to honourable members. But with regard to the foregoing there will be no change whatsoever in the Standing Orders-merel y a desire that when changes in practice under the Standing Orders are brought here, we would point out that Assistant Ministers would have the right that I have just mentioned. Again I ask the question: Could any sane man object to this procedure? The next one relates to an amendment of standing order 91. This applies to the time limits for debates and speeches. The proposal is that in four separate mattersdiscussions of definite matters of public importance, second readings of Bills, second readings of Bills under certain different circumstances and the Committee stage of Bills-the Assistant Minister should have exactly the same time limitation as the Minister he is representing. Again, is this anything of great substance that should give us cause for thought? There is another amendment relating to standing order 143, which states that questions may be put to a member, not being a Minister, relating to any Bill, motion or other public matter connected with the business of the House, of which the member has charge. What we are proposing here is that questions may be put to a member, not being a Minister or Assistant Minister, relating to the same subject matters. Again, is there anyone who could honestly object to this change being made? I doubt it. For that reason I am rather sorry that a debate on this matter should have been raised and should have delayed the House for so long. Standing order 319 relates to the presentation of papers. We want to confer that right on the Assistant Ministers as well as on the Ministers themselves. The proposal in regard to standing order 321 would give an Assistant Minister the right to quote from documents, whilst the one relating to standing order 322 would allow Assistant Ministers to move that papers be printed or that they be noted. Here is one of the reasons why the Opposition has raised objections. I believe that every single argument has been superficial. The arguments have no basis in substance. I believe that when it is known to the general public that we in this House have been held up this afternoon for these reasons resentment will be expressed at what is being done by the Opposition. The next point that I want to bring home to the House relates to the procedures that I adopted in publishing the names of those people who would be the Assistant Ministers. Naturally enough, I sought advice from my officials whenever I felt that advice was desirable as to the proper procedure to be followed. Historically, it has always been the practice, when a Minister of State or a Minister of the kind mentioned by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr N. H. Bowen), such as a Minister without portfolio, an Assistant Minister or some other person who might be assisting a Minister for the time being, has been appointed, for those announcements to be communicated first of all to the Governor General because it is his constitutional right to appoint the individuals. It is not for the House to do it and it is not for me to do it. It can be done only by the Governor General on my advice. So, constitutionally it is my responsibility to advise himfirstof all. I did that yesterday afternoon. I asked for his consent to my issuing a public statement on the matter yesterday afternoon. He agreed, and consequently it was done in accordance with constitutional practice and in accordance with the express approval of the Governor General himself. I emphasise that this has been a practice adhered to since Federation and I see no reason whatsoever why it should be changed. There is one other question that arises. deliberately asked the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) whether he was trying to do a deal; in other words, whether he wanted to put it to me that if we would agree to some increase in the secretarial assistance for members of the Parliamentary Labor Party they would withdraw their opposition to the proposal. The simple fact is that the Opposition has no objection whatsoever in principle. It is obvious that the Opposition wants to do a deal to see whether it can get something out of it. Just listening to it, I can assure honourable members opposite that I will not agree while standing on the floor of the House as I do at this moment. That is our position. I believe it is in the best interests of the government of this country and of members of this Parliament that they should have the opportunity to train themselves for appointment to the Ministry and, for that matter, for appointment to the Cabinet. I know that it will depend to a considerable degree on the capacity ot the Minister and the Assistant Minister who is assisting him, but at least I have this one great advantage. I have discussed the problem with them and I am absolutely confident that they will be able to work together and that they will be able to make a contribution to the government of this country. Having said that, I hope that the Opposition will let us get on with the work of government and of building up this country rather than debating irrelevant matters and trying to have a sordid deal of the kind I have just mentioned.",50
148,Mr SWARTZ,MINISTERS,"On a point of order. 1 point out that there is an urgent matter to he brought up today by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory who wishes to have it cleared ibis afternoon, and I am sure the Opposition does, too. We would like to give the honourable member this opportunity. In viiiw of this I move: That the question be now put. Dr Gun-On a point of order. The Prime Minister has spoken about 8 times in this debate and I think it is absolute and unmitigated arrogance on his part.",52
149,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERS,Order ! The honourable member for Kingston will resume his seat.,52
150,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERS,"A point of order, Mr Speaker. I ask you, Sir: Is it in order for a I Minister to raise a point of order in concealment of the fact that he is moving the gag? The Minister was given the call on the ground that he was raising a point of order but he then moved the gag.",52
151,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERS,"l t is not usually done in this manner, I admit, but I do not know of anything in the Standing Orders which says that it cannot be done in that way.",52
152,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTERS,"On the point of order which the Leader of the House took, as I understand it, he is referring to a motion to disallow a regulation of which notice was given by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory. It is not the fault of the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory that this matter has been brought on only today, the last day on which it can be dealt with. It could have been brought on on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday this week. It is the Government's own fault that it is to be brought on today. If the Government has, through its own ineptitude in this matter of the Assistant Ministers, left too little time to debate it on this last day, then the Government's remedy is to bring in the regulation afresh because it will lapse unless it is dealt with today. But it cannot be taken as a point of order that this matter is urgent today when the Government could have had it on any one of the last 3 days of this week.",52
153,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERS,"Order! In both cases the Chair has been fairly lenient in the particular circumstances of this matter. But I would like to point out that closure may be moved at any time by a Minister. Mr Enderby-On a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is my understanding from inquiries directed to the Clerks that this is not the last day on which this motion can come up. I understand that there are two or three days left next week.",53
154,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERS,I am not aware of this. I do not know the situation in relation to it.,53
155,Mr REYNOLDS,MINISTERS,Why not find out about it?,53
156,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERS,Order ! It is not my duty to do so.,53
157,Mr SWARTZ,MINISTERS,"by leaveThe Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) said that this matter has just been brought on today and that it has been brought on by the Government at this late hour. This is incorrect as the honourable gentleman knows. On 2 occasions this week we have had this matter listed for debate. However, due principally to the delaying tactics of the Opposition it has had to be deferred. Mr Stewart- I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. The last 3 Ministers who spoke in this debate have accused the Opposition of using delaying tactics and not doing the right thing by the Parliament. I ask you, Mr Speaker, kindly to control their remarks and to ensure that they do not infringe the Standing Orders. I feel that on this occasion the Opposition is not using delaying tactics. I think you appreciate this fact and I think you should bring them to order.",53
158,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERS,Order ! The Leader of the Opposition gave the Leader of the House leave to make a statement. In circumstances of this sort it is not the duty of the Chair to agree or disagree with any honourable member's opinions.,53
159,Mr SWARTZ,MINISTERS,"The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Mr Enderby) has raised a matter as to the 16262/71-R-[15 ] time limit for the debating of an ordinance. He knows about this matter because he checked with the Clerk and we know that it has to be cleared before Thursday. I indicated to my opposite number, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Barnard), that we wanted this matter cleared through the House this week because on Tuesday night the Opposition will deliver its reply to the Budget. We did not want this matter to be mixed up with the Budget debate. In other words we did not want to delay the Budget debate at that time. This matter was part of the programme for this week which was accepted by the Opposition. The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory agreed that the debate was to take place this week. I cannot see any reason why at this stage it is indicated that it was not known that the debate was coming on and that the matter has been delayed. I suggest that the only thing that can be done is for this matter to be debated straight away.",53
160,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTERS,"by leave-Since the proceedings are being broadcast and the impression may be gained that the House is being unnecessarily delayed I must point out, as the notice paper shows, that the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Mr Enderby) gave notice of the disallowance of this ordinance on 23rd April this year. Not only would it have been possible for this matter to have been brought up on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday of this week as well as today but also it would have been possible for it to have been brought up at any time between 23rd April and 6th May when the House went into recess. Also it is possible for this matter to come up for debate on Monday when we sit in the afternoon or Tuesday when we sit in the afternoon before I resume the debate on the Budget on Tuesday night. I submit that there is no reason for this matter to be brought on today in such a way as to cut off debate on the other matter relating to the appointment of Assistant Ministers. The only other thing I wish to say is that the rather patronising reference to no sane or honest man saying that there was any difficulty about the Standing Orders which would have to be amended following the appointment of Assistant Ministers could be a reflection on you, Mr Speaker, because you gave us some inkling of the complexity of these changes. Last night they were never indicated to the meeting of the Standing Orders Committee which we both attended but which the Prime Minister (Mr MCMahon) did not.

NA NA ORDINANCE 1971 Motion to Disallow Ordinance",53
161,Mr ENDERBY,PAROLE OF PRISONERS," I move: That sub-section 2 of section 3, and section of the Parole of Prisoners Ordinance 1971 (No. 3 of 1971), made under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910-1970, be disallowed. May I say at the outset that this law affects 150,000 people in the Australian Capital Territory. It is made not by way of a Bill which becomes an Act of Parliament to which amendments can be moved; it is made by means of delegated legislationan Ordinance in relation to which there is no opportunity to move amendments. I make those remarks at the outset to express my feeling that this procedure is a disgrace. As I understand it, I have something like 10 minutes before the House is due to rise. This Ordinance gives power to the courts of the Australian Capital Territory to impose minimum non-parole periods in the sentences imposed on persons who have been convicted in those courts. The Australian Capital Territory courts did not have this power until the enactment of this Ordinance. The idea that judges or magistrates should be given power to sentence a person to a term of imprisonment, and then order that he be not eligible for release on parole until a minimum period of time bas expired, is relatively recent. It became part of Victorian law in 1957 and part of New South Wales law in 1966. Queensland and Western Australia enacted similar legislation and the Commonwealth did so in its Commonwealth Prisoners Act of 1967. I must confess that I have doubt whether a minimum nonparole period imposed by a judge or by a magistrate is a good idea. It seems inconsistent with the idea fhat a person should not be kept in prison any longer than is necessary to effect his reform and also to protect the community. This has a quality of deterrence about it. But I cannot help feel that in large measure it is a power given to judges to bolster their need for believing that the sentences they impose will not be undone by subsequent decisions by psychologists, social and welfare workers, and others who are charged with the duty of observing prisoners and assessing their chances of successful reintegration into society. Be that as it may, the motion before this House does not seem to disallow those provisions of this Ordinance which bring the ACT into line with the situation that exists in Victoria and New South Wales. I 5 hope that honourable members will not be misled or sidetracked by my having expressed my doubt about the provisions because, for the purpose of what I am saying here, I accept that they should be part of the law of the ACT. It is only a matter of my putting my doubt on record. The objectionable feature of this Ordinance is the machinery provision that is set up to determine whether a prisoner is released on parole. Put more plainly, it is the lack of that machinery provision that makes the Ordinance objectionable. The relevant provisions are sub-section (2.) of section 3 and section 5. I should not need to persuade honourable members that the preservation of the liberty of the subject is a vital brick on which our whole system of justice is built. It is so embedded in our law and culture that it would be unthinkable to detain a person in custody unnecessarily without providing proper safeguards and proper machinery to regulate his conditions of release. The giving of an unfettered discretion to the executive arm of government to determine whether he should be at liberty or not is completely opposed to all our history and to all our principles. This history is betrayed and those principles are broken by this Ordinance which does give an unfettered discretion to the executive arm of government to decide whether a person should be free or whether he should not be free. In New South Wales and Victoria, the work of making a decision of that sort as to whether or not a person should be released from custody is given to independent parole boards. They are not part of the executive; they are not part of the Public Service. The New South Wales Parole Board is under the chairmanship of a Supreme Court judge, and there must be at least one woman on the Board. The present New South Wales Board is made up of Mr Justice Allen, a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales; Judge Levine of the District Court; Miss Margaret Telfer, Registrar of the University of Sydney; Mr Ramsay, a retired former Under-Secretary of Justice; Mr J. A. Maroney, Comptroller-General of Prisons, and Mr K. Marsen, Personnel Manager of Leyland Motors, who is also on the Executive of the Prisoners' Aid Society. Honourable members can appreciate the quality of that Board. In Victoria there are 2 adult parole boards-on e for males and one for females. The male parole board consists of a chairman who must also be a Supreme Court judge. Its members consist of the Director-General of Social Welfare and 3 other members who at present are the Chairman of the Prisoners' Aid Society, an ex-Chief Parole Officer, and a medical practitioner. The female parole board has as its chairman the permanent member of the male board and three other women who at present are the Convener of the Female Prisoners' Council, an ex-governor of a female prison and a children's court magistrate. There is also a special Youth Parole Board. In all those cases the parole boards receive evidence from all interested The prisoner is encouraged to make a statement. The parole boards receive opinions from psychiatrists, psychologists, prison officials and welfare people, and with the growing experience and expertise that they, acquire, they make a decision to, whether a prisoner should be released by being parolled. After a decision has been made, a prisoner can have no valid reason in those circumstances to suppose that he has not had a fair go or that he bas not had fair treatment because justice has manifestly been seen to be done. If release on parole is denied or deferred, prisoner can ask for the decision to reconsidered, and he knows it will be reconsidered. Honourable members can the lengths to which the New South Wales and Victorian legislatures have gone to establish independent, top quality boards. I am not suggesting that they have gone too far by any means because I that believe that there should be a right for prisoner to be present and to argue his right to release if necessary. They have not gone that far. I can mink of other improvements also. I ask honourable members to compare the Victorian and New South Wales systems with the system proposed for the Australian Capital Territory, or the lack of system. If section 3 sub-sections (2) and (5) remain part of the Ordinance, the decision on whether a person is to be released or not released will be given to the Governor General; that is, to the Executive arm of our Government. I was taught that it was always undesirable to confer on the Executive powers that are by their nature judicial, because when that is done safeguards associated with the exercise of judicial power are invariably left out or written down. Section 3 Sub-section (2) of the Ordinance states that the reference to the Governor General shall be read as a reference to the Governor General acting on the advice of the Attorney-General. On the face of it, that would suggest that the decision to release or not to release a prisoner could be a political decision, which would, of course, be completely wrong. But we all know that in reality it will mean that the decision to release or not to release will be the decision of an anonymous and unknown public servant, sitting in a back room in the Attorney-General's parties. Department. He may or may not be qualified; he may or may not be wise; he may or may not be prejudiced; and he may or may not be competent. Such a system is completely wrong, and as the ideals behind our much vaunted concept of the rule of law will be severely dented if a decision making power that so vitally affects the liberty of the subject is created in this way. It does not detract from this criticism one whit to say that the Attorney-General's Department may have each case processed first by, say, the New the South Wales Parole Board because our be prisoners go to New South Wales. The decision to adopt, reject or vary any recsee ommendation that might be made by the New South Wales Parole Board would still be an administrative decision made 'by an parole anonymous public servant here in Canberra. I hasten to add that I believe the officers of the Attorney-General's the Department are all hard working and dedicated men. But, having said that, I must also say that that is not the question. Justice must be done and must be seen to be done. Although these officers are unknown, they are associated in the minds of prisoners with the prosecution that put them in gaol. No prisoner who is refused parole will believe that justice has been done to him or that he has had a fair go when he knows that the decision on whether he would be released was in the hands of people whom he does not know, who probably are unknowable to bim and whose decisions he cannot influence, but who in his mind are associated with Crown prosecutors and police prosecutors who helped to put him in gaol. I ask the House to consider the powers given by section 5 of the Ordinance. It they made. gives an absolute and unfettered discretion to the Governor General. As I have said, it means that in reality the departmental officer in the Attorney-General's DepartSub-section ment who is charged with doing this work will make the decision. I should add at point that in reply to a question I put not long ago to the Attorney-General I was given to understand that there is one time departmental officer doing the job present, assisted part time by 2 senior officers. Those officers will have the power, in an unfettered way, to order the release or otherwise of a prisoner. There nothing in the Ordinance to direct a departmental officer or officers to take account of medical reports, psychological reports or reports of social or welfare officers, or to take account of the opporreleased tunities or lack of opportunities for gainful employment outside gaol. The discretion will be the officers' cretion and it is not controlled in any There can be no judicial control over it. To cite some extreme examples, the discretant tion could be exercised one way or another because a particular officer believed that one type of crime was more serious another type of crime, irrespective of the views of this Parliament. For example, an officer might take the view that people guilty of culpable driving of a motor vehicle are much more guilty in a moral sense than people who break into stores, something of that sort, irrespective of Parliament said. He might be influenced cynicism about the rehabilitation of prisoners or because he places excessive and unreasonable importance on the need to protect society. The exercise of an officer's discretion could even be influenced one way or another because he was anti-Catholic, anti-Protestant or anti-Semetic. If it happened, there would be no way of knowing. As I have said, it could not be found out who the officer was, except informally. If some injustice occurred, there would be no way for anyone outside the Public Service to find out who had made the decision. No member of Parliament could rise to his feet in this House and describe, as I have described, the people who have this power and who constitute the parole boards of New South Wales and Victoria and have the direct responsibility for the decisions If honourable members look at the complete Ordinance, there is worse to come. (5) and (6) of section 5 enable this officer to include conditions in any this order that he makes that a person be released. He could, for example, order that the prisoner not associate with any other full person, even a member of that person's at family. He could order him to live in one area and not in another area. He could order that he take some form of employment, and not some other form of employis ment. He could order that he be in employment and stay in employment irrespective of shortages of employment opportunities or the attitude of, say, an employer. The officer could order that the prisoner drink or not drink alcohol, enter a hotel or not enter a hotel. He could order if he wanted to that the prisoner, now released, wear 'his hair short or disthat he wear it long. The section goes as way. far as that. It would all depend on what the particular officer thought was imporor unimportant, relevant or irrelevant and, as I have said, there would be no way of challenging the decision or appealing than against it in any way. The same officer could order that a person be released and then could change his mind at any time, and need not give any reason for having so changed his mind. or Such an incident could occur if the officer what exercised the power to revoke the order. by The New South Wales Parole Board could not come into consideration at all in that regard because it would be a departmental decision. The officer could vary the order or revoke it and cause the person concerned to be put back into prison for what would then become, in effect, an indefinite period. There is nothing in the Ordinance to say that the officer, the Governor General or the Attorney-General has to have a reason. It could be at the exercise of a whim. One would hope that it would not be, of course. An interesting feature of the Ordinance is this: The comparison between the role given to the departmental officer and the Attorney-General and to the role of the courts of petty sessions. Whereas the officer who performs this work will have no checks or procedures imposed upon him at all, except perhaps checks of a superior officer and ultimately the Attorney-General, there are checks of a proper kind contained in sections such as section 10 which applies, in other circumstances, where a court of petty sessions has cancelled a parole order. In such circumstances, an appeal to the Supreme Court is provided for. At least a magistrate's decision to cancel parole takes place in open court and the magistrate has to give reasons. Those reasons have to be supported by sworn evidence. The officer in the Attorney-General's Department is not required to work in this way or formulate his reasons in this way at all. Yet, there is provision for an appeal from the decision of the magistrate and no provision for appeal from the decision of the departmental officer. The opportunities for abuse and, more importantly, a feeling of injustice on the part of the prisoner, are obvious. The fact that there is ministerial responsibility involved does not alter a thing. A biased, spiteful prison warder could submit an unfair report on a prisoner to the departmental officer. The prisoner would not know what was in the report and would have no way of knowing. He would have no way of challenging it, and yet the departmental officer might not think it was biased and spiteful-h e might not even know it was-and might act upon it. There would be no way of testing the report. It may be said that I am making too much of the need to impose judiciallike standards into this subject of release on parole. I do not believe that I am, because even if it were proper to describe- I emphasise the word 'describe'- a decision to release a person on parole as an executive decision, the proper standards should still have to be applied. There is some room for confusion when one comes to consider this question of terminology because some of the earlier literature on parole boards described them as exercising an executive function rather than a judicial function. But this was before parole boards of the present kind were created and before the present system of giving power to a judge to impose minimum non-parole periods was created. For example, under the old system in New South Wales, a parole board could consider only cases referred to it by the Minister of Justice. The board made recommendations to the Minister. In those days, there were no minimum non-parole periods imposed by judges. The point I wish to make, that the judicial standards should be aimed at, has been made abundantly clear in the speech of the New South Wales Minister of Justice, Mr Maddison, during the second reading of the New South Wales legislation introduced in 1966. Mr Maddison described the changes between the old system and the new system which he was then introducing. He said: This Bill, therefore, changes in respect of determinate sentences, the whole concept of parole in New South Wales. It also alters the powers and constitution of the Board. Because the Board is considering only those cases specified by the Court and at times designated by the Court, it seemed proper to consider these to be parts of the judicial process, and therefore the Board is empowered to authorise release and impose conditions of release. It was decided to put this responsibility on the Board rather than leave it to the Attorney-General as had previously been the case and as this Ordinance seeks to do. Mr Maddison continued: It is also vested with the converse power of revoking an order of parole in the event of a breach of the conditions imposed. The draftsmen of our Australian Capital Territory Ordinance have adopted part of the New South Wales reform but grafted on to it the very worse features of the old system which was superseded by that New South Wales reform. Mr Maddison went on to say: Because the powers of the Board have been increased, it has been thought proper to provide that the Chairman of the Board be a judge of the Supreme Court. The powers for granting increased parole in the A.C.T. have been more than increased; they have been created from nothing, but they have not been given to a board under the chairmanship of a judge. The Government has chosen instead to give the job to an unknown departmental officer. It is a cheap form of adrninistrative expediency and there should be no room for such administrative expediency where the question of a person's liberty is involved. There are 37 A.C.T. prisoners at present in New South Wales gaols. Only 2 are eligible for parole at this time but that is because the Ordinance was introduced only about 5 months ago and our Supreme Court is understaffed and has been on vacation for some of that time. The numbers will increase. Let me quote the second United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders which met in London in 1960. One of its resolutions, section 6, recommendation 4, is in these terms: It is desirable to apply the principle of before the expiration of the conditions, to the widest possible extent, as a practical solution of both the social and the administrative problems created by imprisonment. The authority releasing the prisoner should specialised and decisions about the prisoner should be taken, preferably after a personal view with him, but in any case, on the basis of exhaustive information about him. If this part of the Ordinance remains law, that standard will certainly not be met and, more importandy, it will certainly not be seen to be met. I have heard it said by a departmental legal officer in Canberra that it is not necessary to impose judicial standards on the question of whether or not a prisoner should be released because even after he is released, he is still under a sentence, imposed by a judge. This view of things would go on to say that the judge's task is finished at the sentence stage and that all that happens afterwards are matters for administrative or executive decision. This is a dangerous and deceptive answer because it hides the reality of the situation. The fact is that a decision of whether to parole or not to parole is a decision whether to give freedom or not to give freedom. It is that decision that affects a person's liberty. The fact that he remains under sentence only affects his departmental status and is a matter for administrative or departmental record. There is another answer to this very sterile and unrealistic point of view. Judges should play a part in any decision whether to release on parole or not to release on parole. Their work should not finish at the time of recording sentence. They should partake in the additional experience of being allowed to follow through on the cases that have come before their courts. I am talking now of ACT judges and magistrates. Only in this way will judges lose some of the narrow legalism of approach with which they are sometimes associated.",55
162,Mr SPEAKER,PAROLE OF PRISONERS,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired. Is the motion seconded?,59

165,Mr SPEAKER,PAROLE OF PRISONERS,"I am sorry, but I have release called already the honourable member for sentence subject to Maribyrnong.",59
166,Dr CASS,PAROLE OF PRISONERS,"I do not believe that anybe body on either side of the House does not - accept the arguments in favour of the interparole system. Its purpose as an integral part of the whole judicial system is to ensure that people who have for some reason or other broken the law and need to be incarcerated are properly rehabilitated into the community. After all, just to approach it from the point of view of punishment, we know from experience, mostly fails. The essence of the exercise these days is surely to realise that we must readjust the approach of the criminal so that he accepts the norms of society and fits in readily once his time in prison is over. That is where the parole system is important. The judgment of whether or not a person is fit for parole is a complex one. It involves judgment of many factors, such as the attitude of the individual, his aptitude to find another occuption or better cope with the occupation he had. After all, these may be factors that contributed to his breaking the law in the first place. Other matters to be considered would be his ability to fit in, his socialising tendencies within the community itself and the environment to which he is likely to return. To form judgments on these matters we recognise clearly that it is important to have something like parole boards. I do not think any honourable member disagrees with that. What I find distressing is that with this ordinance we are tending to go hack from an advance that was made, at least in New South Wales, where, as the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Mr Enderby) mentioned, the Minister who introduced legislation in 1966 indicated that he was taking away from the Minister the right to make the final decision. I think this was a clear advance. He was leaving the sole responsibility for deciding whether a prisoner would be placed on parole in the hands of a parole board, and that is where the responsibility should lie. Risks will have to be taken and sometimes, even with the best of intentions, some of the paroled persons may well break their parole. In the situation proposed for the Australian Capital Territory we will not necessarily know the recommendation of the parole board. It will all rest in the hands of the officer to whom the authority is delegated or the Attorney General. Why should he be lumbered with the responsibility of having let out of gaol someone who subsequently breaks parole? This, in essence, is what the present situation amounts to. Surely it would be far better to adopt the New South Wales practice which is to leave it in the hands of a competent, specialist parole board. I am sure that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr N. H. Bowen) does not disagree with me. The Government has accepted that prisoners in the Australian Capital Territory should be dealt with by the New South Wales board. However, by this ordinance the Government is reverting to the practice of insisting that the final decision will rest in essence in the hands of the Attorney-General. With all respect, I think that is a foolish move. I think the Government should take the plunge, accept the practice in New South Wales and leave it to the parole board. Mr N. H. BOWEN (Parramatta-Minister for Foreign Affairs) (4.12)-The Government opposes the motion for the disallowance of this ordinance. The first point made by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Mr Enderby) was that this ordinance applied to 150,000 people in the Australian Capital Territory. In one sense that is true enough, but when we are speaking about the parole of prisoners let us get this matter in perspective. The latest figures that I have-figure s for July-indicat e that there were 37 Australian Capital Territory prisoners, 2 of who were eligible for parole. There would not be 150,000 people being dealt with by the parole board. Good heavens, I would not wish to make that reflection on the people of the Australian Capital Territory. I am not underrating the importance of the problem of the prisoner or of the liberty of the subject; what I am saying is that if 150,000 prisoners were involved what would be needed would be not only a parole board but also a substantial department to handle the matter. What size parole board sitting the entire year would be needed to deal with 2 prisoners in an entire year? Practical considerations come into this. It may be, as I said earlier, that there will be a parole board in Canberra but at present it is hardly justified by the amount of work that is involved. Coming down more to the base of the criticism that has been offered, it has been put that there are objectionable features in the machinery for the release of prisoners on parole under the ordinance because it gives an unfettered discretion to the Executive. In the same breadth it was said that these decisions will, in fact be made and the conditions will be set by some officer in a back room. I shall deal with those 2 things in reverse order. I think that the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory has given less than credit to the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth in suggesting that these matters are actuaUy decided by some officer in a back aroom. This is not a power which the Attorneys-General-at any rate, since I have been exercising the office)-hav e delegated. It is a matter about which they have considerable personal anxiety and to which they have given considerable personal attention. Therefore, I do not think it is proper to lay undue stress on the argument that the power is given to some officer in a back room. It is true that the relevant material is put up to the Attorney-General by officers and that included in it may be advice from parole officers, but the decision to give advice to the Governor General is exercised by the Attorney General. I turn now to a more important principle. It has been stated that we are involved here with the liberty of the subject and that this liberty is threatened by having 'the matter in the hands of the Executive. I have heard this view expressed quite often lately. I am surprised at the extent to which there is a lack of understanding of the safety of the subject in putting matters of this kind into the hands of a Minister who is answerable publicly in the House instead of putting them into the hands of a parole board whose members may or may not be known and are answerable to no-one. Where is the liberty of the subject protected in the second circumstance? The liberty of the subject is much more protected when a Minister is answerable to the representatives of the people in this House than it would be if it were in the hands of some obscure, anonymous board which is answerable to no-one. Secondly, if a dreadful crime is comand mitted by a parolee, should the responsible Minister shelter behind the parole iboard? Why should he not be answerable to the representatives of the people in the ParliaTerritory) ment? That is the view which has been Speaker taken in Great Britain, which still retains the system that we have here. Great Britain is, after all, the place of origin of most of our love of liberty and our way of handling and protecting our civil Liberties. It is true that New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia have delegated this responsibility to a parole board. I suspectperhaps one should not say too positively that this is so-that the enormous numbers with which they deal is the reason for adopting this approach. It is because it would bulk so large in the work of the Attorney-General to deal with them personally that machinery provisions have led to the establishment of the practice of a parole board handling these cases, rather than as a means of safeguarding the Uberty of the subject. I challenge the principle that was put forward by the honourable member for 'the Australian Capital Territory. We will keep this matter under review, particularly having regard to the liberty of the prisoners involved, but for the present, what is contained in this ordinance is, I believe, the proper thing to have contained in such an ordinance.

In accordance with these standards such advertisements may not be televised between 6.00 a.m. and 830 ajn. or between 4.00 p.m. and 7.30 p.m., Monday to Saturday inclusive, nor at any time on Sunday, Christmas Day or Good Friday. No advertisements for alcoholic liquor may be televised or broadcast in proximity to programmes for children or at times when the audience may be expected to include large numbers of young people. Young people, whether children or adolescents, must not be allowed to participate in the presentation of these advertisements. The foregoing provisions do not prevent the sponsorship of sporting events broadcast or televised live on Saturday or sponsorship identification in the form of billboards, or other forms of institutional identification which do not include a sales message for alcoholic liquor. The Board maintains close surveillance of the programmes of commercial broadcasting and television stations to ensure that the above requirements are observed. Trade Unions: Fines (Question No. 3002) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: What was the total amount of fines (a) imposed on trade unions by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and (b) collected from trade unions during each of the years 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964 and 1965? Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is assumed that the tribunal referred to was the Commonwealth Industrial Court and not the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and further that the fines referred to were those imposed under the former section 111 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The information required is set out in the following table. It should be noted that although the fines imposed and collected were in pounds, they bave been converted to dollars. 1959 200 1960 6,810 1961 3,700 1962 . . 18,300 1963 . . 25,100 1964 . . 61,200 1965 . . 40,700 * Fines are not necessarily collected in the year in which they are imposed. Trans-Australia Airlines: Cancelled Flight (Question No. 3196) D r Cass asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (I) What arrangements were made by Trans-Australia Airlines to transport passengers booked on the cancelled Electra flight TN425 from Canberra to Melbourne on Sunday 17th January 1971.

In effect this was what was done finally. To relieve the Electra aircraft which had been assigned to operate flight 425 bn: was unserviceable at Canberra, it was necessary to position another aircraft into Canberra. The only available aircraft was in Melbourne and it was assigned to operate flight 496, Melbourne/Canberra, and flight 433, Canberra/Melbourne, thus covering flights originally programmed for the unserviceable Electra. (2) The Electra aircraft was declared serviceable at 8.58 p.m. Defence: Public Relations Expenditure (Question No. 3210) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: What amount was spent on public relations by his Department and each of the Service departments during (a) 1960-61, (b) 1965-66, (c) 1968-69 and (d) 1969-70?

And (c) which airline company operated each of these flights?",64
172,Mr SWARTZ,JET AIRCRAFT MOVEMENTS AND RUNWAY USAGE,"The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) A curfew period is enforced at Brisbane Airport between the hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. NA Date of Operation January' 2 3 4 S 7 11 H4 18 19 20 22 27 28 29 30 31 FFebruary1 2 5 8 9 AO This curfew applies only to jet aircraft, such as the Boeing 727 and DC9 used by the domestic airlines and the Boeing 707 and DC8 used by the international carriers, and not to turbo-prop aircraft such as the Friendship and Electra, or to piston-engined types. (2) Operations within the curfew period fall (Question No. 3291) into two categories: those which must infringe into curfew hours in order to cater to unusually high traffic demands at peak travel times such as Christmas or Easter; and those which, for operational reasons, including delays due to aircraft unserviceability or weather conditions, cannot avoid infringing the curfew. The former, for which authorisation is sought by the airUnes in advance, are approved by the Minister for Civil Aviation, and the latter are approved by the Airport Director. The accompanying tables provide the information on operations within the curfew period. The first table lists the occasions on which flights by jet aircraft have actually taken place at Brisbane Airport during curfew hours since lst January 1971. This table also shows the operators of the flights concerned. Unfortunately, a similar record for 1970 is not available, but the second table, listing approvals granted for movements by jet aircraft within the curfew period, will afford you an indication to the extent of such operations. I might add that, generally speaking, approvals given for operations within curfew hours exceed the actual number of such movements. TABLE 1 AIRPORT BETWEEN 11 P.M. AND 6 P.M.

(2) How many servicemen are (a) at present accommodated and (b) awaiting allocation of accommodation in these premises? (3) At each defence establishment (a) what is the maximum waiting period for this accommodation (b) how many servicemen are accommodated in pnvate premises and (c) what sum was spent in rent subsidies for private premises in 1969-70? Mr Fairbairn-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Provision of Houses under the Commonwealth/States Housing Agreement (CSHA). State Housing authorities may not build houses on Service establishments where the land is owned by the Commonwealth. In such cases, houses are built and owned by the Defence Services. Other houses for servicemen are provided under the Commonwealth/States Housing Agreement in areas which are described in the Housing Agreement Act 1966 as 'usual residential localities'. some cases these CSHA houses are adjacent to the Service complex at which the personnel are employed, and in other cases they may be some miles distant. The places where houses are provided for Service personnel are listed in column 1 of Annex A. (2) Accommodation of Servicemen in CSHA Houses(a) The number of servicemen, by localities, who occupied houses provided under the CSHA on 30th April 1971, are listed in column 2 of Annex A. The total numbers, by Services, are: Navy Army . . 5,318 Air (b) Servicemen awaiting allocation of accommodation in houses go on to a waiting list and as at 30th April 1971 the numbers were: Navy .. . . 1,301 Army .. .. 1,652 Air . . 1,505 Details are given in column 3 of Annex A and relate to areas of Australia where the CSHA operates, i.e. they exclude the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. A total of about 2,400 houses is already programmed or under construction towards the requirement of 4,458. '(3) Alternative Accommodation for Servicemen(a) In those localities where houses are provided under the CSHA to meet the needs of Service establishments, the maximum waiting periods are listed in column 4 of Annex A. (b) The number of servicemen who are accommodated in private premises are not recorded by the Services for each locality. However, estimates for each Service as at 30th April 1971 are as follows: Navy .. . . 3,811 Army . . 1,113 Air . . 3,870 8,794 (c) The sums spent in rental subsidies for servicemen living in private premises for the financial year 1969-70 are not recorded by the Services for each locality. However, the total rent subsidies for each Service were as follows: S Navy .. .. 161,264 Army .. .. 283,967 Air .. .. 395,189 840,420 The period stated as the maximum waiting time for Service accommodation represents the longest In time that an individual serviceman who is currently on a waiting list, has been awaiting a married quarter in a particular locality. The Navy determines priorities on the basis of the time that has elapsed since the serviceman became entitled to a married quarter and thus the waiting time depends directly upon the availability of married quarters. However, the Army and RAAF operate systems whereby points are allotted to determine relative priorities for the allocation of married quarters. Points are allotted for length of service, number of children, recent separation from family due to an unaccompanied posting and for various other reasons. A married serviceman who has had 15 years of service and 2,174 who has 5 children must always receive a married quarter in preference to a married serviceman in 5,127 the first 2 years of his initial engagement who has no children. Thus the maximum time a service12,619 man in the Army or the RAAF may wait for a married quarter depends to a greater extent on the priority rating accorded to him under the points system, than on the availability of a vacant married quarter. High Speed Hazards (Question No. 3368) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister represent4,458 ing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a film, recently screened throughout Australia and produced by the Central Oflice of Information in the United Kingdom, which deals specifically with the problem of high speed heavy vehicles and the dangerous overshoot by jet aircraft? (2) If so, is the adoption of a gravel arrester recommended as one method of minimising both these hazards? (3) Is the Minister able to say whether, since 1966, the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough has conducted experiments by extending the runway used by conventional jet aircraft so that in emergencies, normally involving overshooting procedure, an aircraft, rather than dangerously abort the landing, can continue the landing procedure and move into a bed of gravel continuous with the runway? (4) If so, can the Minister say whether these experiments have shown that an aircraft moving into the gravel arrester is rapidly brought to a stop without damage to the aircraft, or injury to either crew or passengers? (5) Have the findings of the Royal Aircraft Establishment been examined by his Department; if so, with what result? (6) If not, will the Minister initiate an inquiry into the potentialities of the gravel arrester?",65
173,Mr SWARTZ,BY JET AIRCRAFT AT BRISBANE AIRPORT,"The Minister for Civil Aviation has approved the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The film has been seen by officers of the Department of Civi] Aviation and the subject matter together with similar data has been studied during recent years. (2) Yes. A bed of coarse gravel or shingle adjacent to the runway end was recommended as a method. (3) Yes. The Royal Aircraft Establishment has carried out tests dating from 1966 using a variety of materials-water , sand, soil, gravel and aerated concrete-place d in a shallow pit to determine the effectiveness of such a facility in stopping an aircraft which has overrun the end of the runway. These tests were initially conducted with a vehicle, then with obsolete aircraft and by simulation of aircraft in the Laboratory. Late last year, tests were carried out using a new light weight synthetic aggregate. (4) These tests indicated that whilst there were some problems associated with it, a bed of shingle was effective at the range of entry speeds tested, in rapidly and safely bringing the vehicle and the aircraft to a halt without injury to occupants and without major structural damage to the aircraft. The possibility existed, however, of aircraft skin damage due to flying stones and ingestion of stones into jet engines, which could cause substantial damage. (5) The results of these investigations, together with data on otber types of arresting systems, such as cables and nets used on military aerodromes, have been studied by the Department ot Civil Aviation in respect of application to civil aerodromes in Australia. This subject was also discussed at a major meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation in Montreal during late 1967. Member nations, including Australia, concluded that there was no operational requirement for such devices at this time, but agreed that investigations should continue. Australia supported these views, which still prevail. Information and data concerned with research and devel16262/71-JI-[16 ] opment on aircraft arresting devices is being constantly studied by Departmental officers and the situation is being kept under review. (6) Not applicable in view of answer to part (3) of question. Civil Aviation: Charter Flights (Question No. 3381) Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) Has the operation of free competition been restricted in air travel to and from Australia by Government agreement to enforce price-fixing on charter flights at levels recommended by airline operators. (2) Are those airline operators free to arrange charter services on the same terms and with the same savings as other charter operators; if not, in what way are they prevented from openly competing in the charter market if they should want to do so, either under their own banner or as an associated company. (3) Are adequate safety and employment standards enforced in charter flights; if so, what is the justification for enforcing minimum fares and minimum periods of club membership for charter passengers. (4) ls it in the interests of passengers that uneconomic routes should be sustained with more economic airline operators who have already negotiated give and take agreements with Qantas Airways Limited and Australia in such matters as fares, facilities, safety standards, time tables and routes.",69
174,Mr SWARTZ,BY JET AIRCRAFT AT BRISBANE AIRPORT,"The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Government has fixed a minimum per capita rate, which is subject to periodical review, for travel on international charter flights to and from Australia. All air carriers eligible to perform charter flights in accordance with the Government's charter flight policy are bound to charge the minimum per capita rate and to observe the normal rules of the International Air Transport Association governing charter flights but in all other respects are free to compete with each other for charter business offering. (2) Answered in the reply to question one. (3) (a) In addition to meeting the standards set by the country of their registration air carriers operating charter flights to and from Australia are required to comply with the relevant Air Navigation Regulations. (b) The Government has established minimum per capita rates to provide a stable economic basis for the development of charter services to and from Australia. (c) A minimum period of club membership for charter passengers is one of the rules of the International Air Transport Association governing charter flights. (4) The assumptions on which the question is based are incorrect. Scheduled airlines, including the Australian international flag carrier, charge uniform fares for travel on the world's air routes. Such fares are set by the International Air Transport Association, subject to approval of Governments, and are assessed on a route by route basis having regard to such economic factors common to all airlines as operating costs and traffic density. Fares charged by Qantas Airways Limited throughout - its route network are those recommended by. IATA to all Governments and ' approved' by them and the company (and the Australian Government)' does not negotiate agreements with other airlines in relation to fares and such matters as facilities, safety standards, timetables and routes.",69
175,Mr REYNOLDS,BY JET AIRCRAFT AT BRISBANE AIRPORT,"the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, craft, upon notice: (1) Ts it proposed to construct a parallel runway beside both, the north/south and east/west runways at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport; if so, when. (2) Have any public authorities registered an official protest against these plans; if so, which. (3) Has the Commonwealth any proposal for the acquisition of additional land adjacent to the airport to facilitate extensions.",70
176,Mr SWARTZ,BY JET AIRCRAFT AT BRISBANE AIRPORT,"The Minister for Civil Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's Various question: (1) Parallel runways have been a feature bf the master plan for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport since the mid-1940s.

As a general uously updated and this includes re-examining the precise location of the parallels and the timing with which these additional facilities may be required. I am not yet in a position to advise on the precise timing and extent of these proposed additional aerodrome works. (2) Yes. The Municipalities of Soutb Sydney and Rockdale. (3) The need for additional land and the location of that land including further reclamations within Botany Bay will only be determined on completion of the review of the master plan earlier mentioned. Civil Aviation: Operating Costs (Question No. 3410) Mr Charles Jones asked the Minister Sydney Airport: Runways representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, (Question No. 3403) upon notice: (1) What is the (A) cost per passenger and (B) cost of freight per lb on (i) Boeing 727 air(ii) DC9 aircraft and (iii) Electra aircraft when operating between (A) Sydney and Perth (B) Sydney and Melbourne and (C) Sydney and Adelaide?

On the basis of certain arbitrary assumptions, however, the following are the approximate unit costs requested. They should be - treated as illustrative only and used with caution:Sydney-Adclaide-Pcrth Sydney-Melbourne Sydney-Adelaide Passenger Cargo,Ib Passenger Cargo, lb Passenger Cargo, Ib S % s $ % 107 0.54 26 0.13 39 O.20 24 0.12 36 0.18 124 0.61 29 0.14 44 0.22 route because their operating characteristics are not n that t h n t route. rnut* observation, however, it might be said that, provided appropriate load factors are achieved, these aircraft are expected to be. more . economic on the medium and longer stage length routes. Road Maintenance Tax Defaulters Mr Bennett asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) How many Commonwealth warrants have been issued, in each of the last 5 years, to assist State governments in apprehending road maintenance tax defaulters? (2) How many persons have been imprisoned as a result of these warrants? (3) How many warrants are current? Mr N . H. Bowen-The Attorney General has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: The honourable member's question appears to seek information on the use of the Service and Execution of Process Act of the Commonwealth to enforce penalties under the road maintenance tax legislation of the States. Information was sought from the States on that basis and the following is a summary of the replies received: (1)NA It is possible to supply information only as 6lh May 1969. In the period from that date to l l t h December 1970, 11,050 warrants were issued under the Service and Execution of Process Act to enforce penalties under New South Wales road maintenance tax legislation. lst July 1965 to 30th June 1966-2,60 0 warrants issued lst July 1966 to 30lh June 1967-3,35 6 warrants issued lst July 1967 to 30th June 1968-3,08 8 warrants issued lst July 1968 to 30ih June 1969-2,81 4 warrants issued lst July 1969 to 30lh June 1970-2,47 7 warrants issued. It is not practicable to supply the information sought, as only a daily total of warrants of apprehension is recorded and not the particular offences to which the warrants relate. The only way the desired information could be obtained would be by checking individually each fine card made out in the past 5 years, lt is estimated that in the Magistrates Court, Brisbane, a minimum of 161,250 fine cards would have been typed over the past 5 years. NA No statistics are kept that would enable this information to be given. NA 1967- 290 warrants issued (Question No. 2264) 1968- 815 warrants issued 1969- 1,059 warrants issued 1970- 1,140 warrants issued. NA No warrants have been issued in the last 5 years.

Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court (Question No. 2299) Mr Enderby asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that in the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court there were insufficient judges to hear cases which had been fixed for hearing between the end of October and the end of December last year? (2) Did the scarcity of judges cause the resident judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory to publish a notice in the Canberra press advising that a number of cases which had been fixed for hearing would be taken out of the list with no indication as to when the cases would be heard? (3) Did the resident judge indicate separately to legal practitioners that other cases could not be given a. hearing date. until the position improves? (4) Are any steps being taken to secure the services of additional judges for the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory? (5) Are any steps being taken to appoint a second residential judge for the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory? Mr N. H. Bowen-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Until the latter part of 1970 the existing arrangements under which a number of Judges of the Commonwealth Industrial Court hold appointments as additional Judges of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory enabled matters in the Supreme Court to be dealt with expeditiously. In the latter part of 1970 cession of matters arose in the Industrial Court that precluded the Judges of that Court from giving assistance in Canberra to the same extent as previously and resulted in some delay in the hearing of cases. The Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act has recently been amended to increase to two the number of Judges of the Court who will be resident in Canberra. The new Judge will occupy the position of Chairman of the Law Reform Commission. It is intended that the new Judge will assist from time to time with the judicial work of the Court. His primary duties however will be in relation to the work of the Law Reform Commission. I am keeping under review the question of the appointment of a further Judge of the Supreme Court.

(2) Has any consideration been given to adopting a similar priority in Australia? Mr N. H. Bowen-The Attorney General has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) There are no provisions in Australian patent law specifically providing for priority of examination in the particular cases referred to in the honourable member's suggestion. The Australian legislation does however provide general authority for an applicant to request early examination of his application. Federal Biological Assay Laboratory (Question No. 1879) Mr Grassby asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health; upon (1) When was the Federal Biological Asasy one officer in Laboratory established? (2) How many professional staff are employed in this laboratory? (3) How many new drugs and new formulations were imported into Australia in thefinancialyear 1969-70? (4) How many of these are under test? (5) When will they.be released?

Kingdom and European drug testing authto ensure fully tested drugs are not denied to Australian sick for long periods; if not, will he take steps to ensure that this is done?",72
182,Dr FORBES,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Health has of provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The National Biological Standards Laboratory, to which it is assumed the Honourable memperiod ber refers, was established in 1958. (2) 41. (3) It is not possible to say. However, the of Health approved 163 applications the import of new drugs and new formulations during the .financial year 1969-70. These figures do not represent the full number of new imports, as up until lst August 1970, not all categories of drugs and formulations were covered Patents by import licensing legislation. (4) It is assumed from the subsequent parts of the question that 'under test' relates to drugs on trial. Of the applications processed by the Department, 52 were imported for the purpose ol drawn to the deciclinical trial. (5) It is not possible to say when drugs undei priclinical trial will be released. The decision to make application to my Department for the general marketing of a drug or new formulation rests with the importing company. The application is then referred to the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee for consideration and recommendation, lf the Committee's recommendation is favourable, the importing company then makes the decision as to the timing of the release of the drug. (6) and (7) Many of the drugs which undergo clinical trials in Australia have previously undergone clinical trials and have been in use in an overseas country or countries for a number of years. However, it is nbt necessary for a drug to undergo clinical trials in Australia if adequate information is available on it from reliable overseas sources. Further, it is a fact that the efficacy of a number of drugs, which have been marketed in the United States of America for many years but which have never been approved for the Australian market, has recently been called into serious question and indeed some of these drugs have been taken off the United States market. (8) A close and effective liaison is maintained with overseas drug control authorities. Drug Addiction and Treatment ..(Question No. 2282)",73

Dr Forbes:-The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: .Note: The information contained in the answers to parts (1) to (3) of the honourable member's question was supplied by my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industiy. (1). The following countries export meat products to. Australia: New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Kong, Netherlands, Singapore, United Kingdom, distribution United States of America, Czechoslovakia, Denand mark, Federal Republic of Germany, Ireland, People's Republic of China, France, Italy, Poland, Argentina, Ethiopia, Hungary, Israel, Norway, Paraguay, Switzerland and Uruguay.

Meat Imports (2) If so, was this deadline twice extended on request until mid-February 1971?",75
190,Dr FORBES,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the notice: honourable member's question: (1) Yes. In discussions with the economic advisers of the Australian Medical Association, Commonwealth officers stressed that, if Commonwealth and fund benefits adjustments were to be synchronised with increases in doctors' fees as from lst July 1971, it was essential that the Commonwealth should be advised of the proposed increases at the earliest possible date. Adequate notice was necessary because of the various steps involved in the implementation of benefit changes. These steps included Government consideration of the proposed fee increases and such related questions as: - the benefit adjustment necessary for each service affected in each State; - the costs of such benefit adjustments; - the extent to which these costs would be met by adjustments of Commonwealth and/or fund benefits; - the consequential adjustments in insurance contributions for each medical benefit organisation. After consideration of these - matters, legislation would be necessary to vary the amounts of Commonwealth and fund benefits and the Department Hong would need to arrange for the printing and of medical benefit booklets for doctors medical benefit funds. The funds would need to implement any adjustment of their contribution Malaysia, rates and to print new brochures. Because of the physical printing and other problems, 6 months' notice was desirable, but a minimum of 4 months' nodce was considered period July-January essential. (2) No. Health: Sterilising Operations (Question No. 3050) Dr Everingham asked the Minister represimilar senting the Minister for Health, upon (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to to advice to doctors in the Australian Medical Association Code of Ethics Article 7.8 that operations should be done only for therapeutic reasons and that legal advice from the Association to its members was that such procedures for other reasons could lead to a criminal charge under obscure laws in some States?

Medical Fees (3) If not, will the Minister arrange for consultations to be held in view of the number of large underprivileged problem families with most the children unplanned and inadequately",76
191,Dr FORBES,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I am informed that the Australian Medical Association has removed Article 7.8 from its Code of Ethics. (2) No. (3) No. Commonwealth Medical Inspectors (Question No. 3246) Mr Keating .asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that Commonwealth medical inspectors decide whether the medical condition of a patient warrants the paying of the $2 per day bed subsidy to a nursing home proprietor? (2) If so, what specific training and qualifications do these inspectors have in geriatrics? (3) How many of these inspectors are there in each State?",76
192,Dr FORBES,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) _ Commonwealth medical officers are authorised to approve payments of the Commonwealth nursing home benefit of $2 per day. Section 57(1) of the National Health Act provides, in effect, that (unless the Director-General of Health otherwise directs) this benefit is payable only where a medical practitioner (usually the patient's own doctor) certifies that 'the nature of the illness or injury from which the patient is suffering necessitates nursing home care'. In dealing with applications for payment of this benefit. Commonwealth medical officers usually rely on these certificates. (2) None of the Commonwealth medical officers at present engaged in the granting of sucb approvals has special training in geriatrics specifically, but all are experienced in these dudes. Not all nursing home patients are geriatric patients.

(2) Will the Minister arrange to make a joint statement with the Victorian Minister as to what they conceive as their respective responsibilities in this matter? (3) Will the Minister consider parallel legislation for Commonwealth Territories?",77
194,Dr FORBES,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I am aware that in December 1970 Mr Rossiter. said that the Victorian Government would not require warning labels on cigarette packets unless all other, States did the same. (2) No. The position regarding legislation for the labelling of cigarette packets with health warnings is that the individual States are responsible for such legislation within their boundaries and the Commonwealth is responsible for similar legislation in the Territories. (3) The Commonwealth's view is that when legislation requiring warning labels on cigarette packets has been enacted in all States, the Commonwealth will enact similar legislation for the Territories. Mr Kirwan asked the Minister for External Territories, upon notice: '"" (1) How many West Irianese citizens have been returned, or have been ordered to return, to West Irian by Australian Government authorities? (2) How many of these people were (a) men and (b) men accompanied by their families? (3) How many of those concerned (a) sought and (b) were granted political asylum? . (4) What efforts are made by Government authorities to determine what happens to persons returned to West Irian? (5) What penalties are known to have been imposed upon citizens returned to West Irian? (6) Have there been any Indonesian troop incursions into the Australian Territories; if so, when, whereand with what results?",78
195,Mr BARNES,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (5) The numbers of West Irianese who have been returned or have been ordered to return to West Irian are not available - Because of the nature of the border between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea it is not possible to state the number of people who move across it in eithei direction. Those wbo cross the border fall into the following categories: (a) local border inhabitants who cross the border for social, trading or hunting'purposes. These traditional border dwellers with no wish to reside permanently outside their own traditional area are considered to be by far the largest category of border crossers; (b) those inhabitants of the border region who cross the border into Papua New Guinea and seek to remain there for economic reasons. These people are told by officers at border stations that economic reasons are insufficient to justify the crossing of the border or the right of entry into Papua New Guinea and they are asked to return to West Irian; (c) since 1962 a number of people have entered Papua New Guinea from West Irian and sought permission to remain there on humanitarian grounds. Over 500 people have been granted permission to reside. in Papua New Guinea as a result. Those whose applications for permissive residence are not successful are returned to West Irian in consultation with the Indonesian authorities. Where examination of an - application indicates that it might not be successful the matter is considered by the Administrator's Executive Council before arrangements are made for the person's return. The arrangement by which the Administrator's Executive Council is consulted was instituted in early January 1970 and between then and the end of that year, 21 people (including dependants) had been returned. Arrangements for the return of such people are made public in Papua New West Irian Guinea. Once a person has been returned (Question No. 3318) to West Irian it is not the practice of the Government to enquire further into his whereabouts or circumstances. However, the Government is not aware of any penalties having been imposed on such people. The Australian Government does not send back to Indonesian territory persons wbo, in the view of the Australian Government, have reasonable grounds for fearing persecution for their political activities or beliefs. (6) Shortly after Indonesia took over the administration of West Irian, Indonesian soldiers or police crossed the border on at least a dozen occasions because it is not marked and they were at that time unfamiliar with its location. There have since been three incidents. The first occurred on 6th April 1969 (Hansard 30th April 1969, page 1490). The second occurred in the Kwari area on 19th . May 1969 at a village called Kau-Ulai. The incident involved the shooting by an Indonesian patrol of two West Irianese in Papua. Following these two incidents liaison procedures were established between the authorities on both sides of the border with a view to avoiding such incidents. 'In general, these have proved satisfactory. However, an Indonesian patrol entered the Territory of New Guinea on 4th October 1970 in the vicinity of Sekotcbiau in the West Sepik District and burned some bush huts. Liaison procedures were put into effect and an aerial inspection was made by both Australian and Indonesian officials. Indonesian officials ordered the patrol to return to West Irian and made it clear that they regarded the incursion of the patrol as serious. They assured the Australian authorities that Indonesian patrols bave standing instructions not to cross the border.. Handicapped Persons (Question No. 3346)",78

(2) If not, will appropriate steps be taken?",79
199,Dr FORBES,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) The development of uniform statistics is a continuing process and is being actively pursued by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics and by my Department. of Census and Statistics is developing the collection of uniform statistics in a number of health Vear areas. Details of the steps already taken by my 196566 Department are: (a) - A Central Statistical Unit, . headed by 1967officers seconded from the Bureau of 1969-70 Census and Statistics, has been established in my Department. A principal role of this unit is to work in close co-operation with the Bureau of Census and Statistics to develop and maintain national systems of collection and dissemination of uniform statistics specifically related to the functions of (he Department of Health. (b) Three sub-committees of the National Health and Medical Research Council namely the Hospital Statistics (Standing) Sub-Committee and the Disease Classification Sub-Committee, which report to the Medical Statistics (Standing) Committee, and the Mental Health Records Sub-Committee, which reports to the Mental Health (Standing) Committee, are engaged in the investigation of the collection and interpretation of . uniform statistics in the fields of hospital morbidity, the presentation of hospital records, the classification of diseases and the recording of mental illness. (c) At the 1970 Conference of Australian Health Ministers, a Hospital and Allied Services Advisory Council was established comprising two representatives from each Stale and the Commonwealth.

In three of the sub-commit'ees set up by this Council, namely the ADP National Computer Committee, the Uniform Costing Committee and the Research Committee, projects will be undertaken which will be of assistance to this Department's Central Statistical Unit in its work. Hospitals: Finance (Question No. 3351) - Mr HAYDEN asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: Is the Minister able to furnish details of the (a) amounts written off as bad debts by public hospitals and (b) indebtedness of public hospitals in each State in each of the last 5 years for which details are available.",79
200,Dr FORBES,WESTERN AUSTRALIA,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) The relevant State authorities have advised that bad debts written off by public hospitals in each State except Victoria for the years 1965-66 The Bureau to 1969-70 were as follows: N.S.W.

The honourable member however should note the following factors in connection with these statistics: (i) Accounting procedures related to the raising of charges and subsequent rebate or writeoff when fees are uncollectable are not necessarily uniform either between States or as between individual hospitals within a particular State. Hence inter-State comparison is unrealistic. (ii) In some States, the statistics embrace certain nursing homes as well as public hospitals where the details appropriate to the former institutions cannot be separated from aggregate figures. (iii) Reliable statistics for New South Wales earlier than 1967-68 are unavailable. (iv) Bad debts written-off in South Australia do not include those from country subsidised hospitals as these details are unavailable. (v) The amount of bad debts written-off in Victoria in each year is not available to my Department. (b) The State authorities in Victoria and Tasmania have advised that the indebtedness of public hospitals in their respective States as at 30 June in each of the years 1966 to 1970 was as follows: Year Victoria Tasmania 1-966 8,467.9 ---1967 8,354.7 1968 - -- 9,888.3 1969 10,037.9 1970 - 10,569.0 The indebtedness of public hospitals in Queenstotal land, South Australia and WesternAustraliain each of the years 1966 to 1970 was nil. Details of indebtedness for public hospitals New South Wales are not available in aggregated form. It should be noted that due to differences in the States' approaches to public hospital indebtedness meaningful comparisons as between States are not possible.

Hospital and Medical Benefit Funds (Question No. 3374) Mr Collard asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that hospital funds are inconvenienced to some extent because some doctors fail to present fund cheques to their banks for clearance in order to reduce their taxation. (2) If so, is this practice significant when sidering the need for an increase in doctors' fees? (3) Will the Minister have the practice examined before the Government approves the proposed increases?",82
207,Dr FORBES,CAPITAL CITIES,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honhome ourable member's question: (1) (2) and (3) Inquiries made with the major health insurance organisations operating in each State indicate that these organisations have not encountered any problems in regard to delays in the presentation of benefit cheques to banks. A regional organisation in Western Australia has reported however, that a particular doctor holds its cheques of over (10.00 for a full 11 months before presenting them to the bank'. This is a matter over which neither the Commonwealth nor the organisation has any control. Hospital and Nursing Home Beds (Question No. 3440) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister representand ing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) What is the ratio between (a) the number people aged 60 years or more and (b) the number available. of public and private approved nursing home beds of services throughout Australia? - (2) What would be the cost to the (a) Federal by Government and (b) pensioners if the ' fees been charged for those at present accommodated into approved nursing homes were covered by provisions comparable to those which apply to hospital costs under the National Health Act.

(2) The fees charged by nursing homes' vary widely from State to State and as between different types of homes. The costs to the 3 parties to any insurance scheme, viz., the Commonwealth, the contributor and the patient, would depend on the level at which benefits were set and the extent to which fees charged are met by and medical benefit each party. (3) The number of approved nursing home beds available in:Australia is greater than the number of geriatric beds established in comparable develcon- oped countries. The optimum number depends on the needs and environmental background of the aged, on which precise information is not available on a national basis.

(3) (a) and (b) Information for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory is shown in the following table. Because of the approximate nature of the pre-school expenditures referred to in 2 (b) above and the several reservations made by the Treasurer on the comparability and coverage of these figures I do not think that it would be appropriate to calculate the percentage and per capita ngures that have been requested.

Initially, subsidies were $1,600 per annum for each additional nurse employed by organisations in the former category and $800 per annum for each nurse employed by organisations which commenced operations after September 1956. These rates of subsidies were subsequently increased in 1960, 1962, 1966, 1968 arid 1970 as follows: TABLE 1 PER 10,000 POPULATION: 19S6 TO 1969-70 --- All Vic. Qld S.A. WA. Tas.

Accordingly, the National Health Act did not require organisations to maintain separate memberships and financial returns for each State. However, in the case of all major organisations that operated Interstate the information is available separately and has been included in the respective States. In the case of some smaller organisations, however, separate State figures have not been maintained and therefore figures for these organisations bave been included in the States in which the organisations' head offices are situated.

(4) Can he say what proportion of the nonAboriginal population were the non-Aboriginal entrants and graduates of tertiary education institutions corresponding to the figures sought in part (1)? Mr Fairbairn-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2), (3) and (4) With the exception of some material collected in my Department as a result of the introduction of the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme, information needed to provide an answer to the honourable member's question is not available to me. In 1969 the Government introduced the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme in order to provide assistance to persons of Aboriginal descent to undertake courses of study after leaving school. A number of persons taking up these grants have applied them to tertiary courses. The numbers of persons who took up Study Grants for the first time in 1969 and 1970 in courses which are wholly or principally at tertiary level are set out below. Complete information for 1971 is not yet available. Because the Grants are available to students who have already enrolled in courses as well as to those about to commence studies, a small number of the students noted here may have started courses prior to their receiving a grant.

The figures for 1968-69 are also given because of revisions to the figures supplied previously (Hansard, 12th June 1970, page 3683) f o i expenditure by Tasmania, and consequently by the six States combined, in that year.

Australian citizenship by registra68 tion. 62 55 However, between 26 January 1949, when the 95 provision for citizenship by registration was intro58 duced by the Nationality and Citizenship Act 93 1948, and the 30 June 1970, 590 persons became 100 Australian citizens by registration. This represents 89 approximately 4.4 per cent of those eligible as at 9 30 June 1970 to seek citizenship by this means. 68 Of interest in this connection is the following 72 statement made by my colleague the Honourable B. M. Snedden when introducing the Citizenship 50 Bill 1969 which provided a very simple means by 97 which British migrants could acquire Australian 64 citizenship through the process of notification 76 afterfiveyears residence: 80 British migrants, after living in Austraha for 95 long periods come to think of themselves as 6 Australian citizens. Few of them, give any 47 serious; thought to making application for the 62 formal grant of citizenship by registration, for 60 of course they bave nothing material to gain 68 from becoming Australian citizens, already 53 having (he right to vote, to be appointed or 99 elected to public office, and the like. It is 22 therefore natural that after being in. Australia 31 for long periods they think of themselves as 100 Australian citizens; and so, when they wish to 100 travel abroad, for instance, they are surprised 97 and hurt to find they' cannot have Australian 62 passports. It is a very common occurrence that 46 they do not have time before 'travelling to 94 obtain Certificates of Registration, . and as a 19 result are obliged to obtain British passports .97 from the British High Commissioner. The Gov71 ernment believes that these members of our 96 community should have an extremely quick and 28 simple way of becoming Australian citizens, and 100 Clause 8 of the Bill will make this possible. This provision came into force on 1 May 1970 and since then slightly more than 4,500 persons 52 have acquired Australian citizenship by notifica100 tion. 95 40 Australian Minerals Council 99 (Question No. 3125) 97 Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for 26 National Development,- upon notice: 100 (1) Has the Australian Minerals Council coin42 missioned a committee to study the environment 67 as the Australian Forestry Council and the Aus100 tralian Water Resources Council have done.

(5) How many Australian servicemen have been (a) killed and (b) wounded in the Vietnam theatre of war. (6) How many ex-servicemen are receiving repatriation pensions and services as the result of service in the Vietnam theatre of war. Mr Fairbairn-The answer to the hondecided ourable member's question is as follows: (1) From the time Australian personnel were first posted to"" Vietnam up to 30th June 1970 amount of $163.119m on action by all arms of the Services has been incurred by the Australian Forces. This - amount represents the excess over normal costs in Australia of the Services. (2) The dissection between the Services of the amount of $163.119m is as follows: Navy Army .. .. Air . . .. .. (3) During the period of our commitment an amount of $15.187m has been spent by the Australian Government on civil aid in Vietnam.

Australian Capital Territory: Taxation Assessments (Question No. 3429) Mr Enderby asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) How - many Canberra residents had not received their taxation assessments for the 1969-70 taxation year by lst May 1971. (2) Why has there been a delay in processing income tax assessments for these residents of the Australian Capital Territory? (3) When is it expected that all A.C.T. assessments for the 1969-70 taxation year will have been processed and all refund payments made? Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Because A.C.T. residents lodge their returns in various States depending on the source of their incomes, and these cases are not always segregated, the particular information requested is not available. However, the returns of most A.C.T. taxpayers are lodged in Canberra and processed iri the Sydney office of the Commonwealth Taxation Office. Approximately 50,000 A.C.T. refund cheques had been issued by lst May 1971. On that date, the Sydney office was holding about 700 returns of A.C.T. taxpayers not subject to provisional tax for which assessments had not been issued. Assessments have since been issued in all but 48 of these cases. The balance will be issued shortly. (2) The assessments in these cases did not issue before lst May for a variety of reasons. Many of the returns were received only a short time before 1st May. Tn other cases, additional information was required before assessments could issue or enquiries had to be made regarding lost tax stamp sheets and group certificates. (3) See answer to (1).
