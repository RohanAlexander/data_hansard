2,Mr FENTON,Unknown,".When w e were discussing the limited agenda-paper for the Washington Conference, the Prime* Minbounty ister (Mr Hughes) promised that he would tell the House later what instrucbeen arrived .at? tions would be given to the Australian delegate at Washington, and how he would act. Is the right honourable genaging tleman in a position to do that now?",19
3,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"What I said, so far as I can recall it, is that I would take an cotton growing. opportunlity of discussing the matter of instructions with the Leader of the position and the Leader of the Country party, and that if there were a difference of opinion between us I would have to take the responsibility of acting for self, or would submit to Parliament the matter in dispute. So far, no instrucwithin tions of any sort or kind, either in writhead-quarters ing or viva voce, have been given.",20
4,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Has the right honourable gentleman discussed matters with the leaders of the other parties in the House?,20
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,No instructions whatsent ever have been given.,20
6,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Then, has Senator Pearce a free hand?",20
7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Absolutely . Senator Pearce is a citizen of this country, who knows well the feeling of its people, having been a member of this Legislature for twenty years continuously. If honourable members desire that he shall receive structions, let them state what they wish to instruct him about,, and we can have a discussion on the subject.",20
8,Mr EILEY,Unknown,"'How do we know that the Government? Senator Pearce will represent the wishes of this country in regard to disarmament, seeing that as Minister for Defence he prepared large estimates of expenditure for armaments during the coming year? What guarantee have we that he is pared to advocate a policy of disarmamember ment?",20
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"-The question is algow, most metaphysical in its subtlety, and this hour of the morning, after my other labours of the past few days, I do not feel capable of answering it . BOUNTY ON COTTON.",20

We are Avatching the position closely, and as it is the desire of the Government to encourage the growing of cotton in Australia, we shall take such action as the circumstances may warrant. SUGAR INDUSTRY.",20
14,Mr OORSER,Unknown,"Since a deputation recently waited on him in connection with in the sugar industry, has the Prime Minister come to any decision on the matters put before him then; or can he give us any information as to the intentions of",20
15,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"No action will be taken by the Government without the has fullest opportunity being given to the House to consider and discuss the matters referred to. A deputation, consisting of prethe honourable member, the honourable for Herbert (Mr Bamford), the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs), Senator Crawford, Senator Glasand others, waited on me last week, at and the same gentlemen have seen me on occasions; and I have promised that if and when the Government contemplates dealing with the sugar ""question, or considers that circumstances demand further action, it will consult the members this Parliament who are directly inbefore it formulates its policy. conThe honourable member may accept my assurance that that will be done. At the present time, these matters have not ceived the consideration of the Govern the ment; but probably some time next year they may require attention. Until then, nothing will be done. WAR SERVICE HMS. WESTERN AUSTRALIA.",20
16,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I ask the Minister in charge of the War Service Homes Commission whether complete arrangements have yet been made for the building of homes in Western Australia, more particularly in the country districts of that State?",21
17,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Yesterday , I had an opportunity of conferring with the Premier of Western Australia on the subject, and of concluding final arrangements with his Government for the completion of our programme in that State. An agreement embodying the terms arrived at will be prepared and laid on the table in due course. Next week, I propose to make a statement concerning the affairs of the Department, and shall then deal more fully with this matter. NEW HEBRIDES. OFFER OF LAND.",21
18,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.13] - I wish, with the permission of honourable members, to mention a matter upon which I desire the opinion of the House-a offer made on behalf of the French proprietors of land in the New Hebrides sell their interests for a sum of money Hebrides-£22,00 amounting to £500,000; and the option Customspreparing expires almost immediately.",21
19,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Shal l we have opportunity of discussing the matter ? Is the right honourable' gentleman making a statement by leave, or is he going to move a motion?",21
20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am not aware whether the Prime Minister intends to conclude with a motion. If he wishes to make a statement, it will be necessary to get the leave of the House. Leave granted.",21
21,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"If I did not mention the matter now, I might be open to censure, because it might be said that I had deprived Parliament of the opportunity to accept the offer. Honourable remembers know that the conditions under Condominium are very unsatisfactory. The acceptance of this offer would place all the land in the New Hebrides under the control of British holders. Perhaps I had better lay on the table a paper which I have here giving a summary of the proposal.",21
22,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,How long has the right honourable gentleman had the option?,21
23,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I could not say; but a long time. I am against the acceptance of the proposal horse, foot, and artillery; but I am only one member of the House, and honourable members may do as they please concerning it. The offer was made when I was in London, and I had the option extended.",21
24,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Unti l what date?,21
25,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Fro m memory, I cannot give the date. It is stated in the paper which I propose to lay on the table that the New Hebrides Company say that, failing immediate acceptance, they must deal elsewhere. I do not know that we are really concerned in the matter as a Government; but, as the offer has been made to me, I put it before Parliament, so that honourable members can share the responsibility of dealing with it. I now lay the paper on the table.",21
26,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Why not read it, so that we may know what the offer is?",21
27,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The statement with which I am furnished is as follows:n AUSTRALIA'S INTERESTS IN NEW HEBRIDES. Since 1902 the Commonwealth Government to has spent approximately £134,000 in New 0 for assistance to settlers in land claims, £4,000 in refund of duties, and about £108,000 on a steamer service. o an Australia naturally gets the bulk of the export trade as a result of this latter expenditure. Our main interest, however, lies in the fact that the natives of New Hebrides are decreasing, and labour must be imported. The French own the bulk of the land, and it is understood are anxious to import Asiatic labour. The presence of any considerable number of Asiatics so near Australia, especially as we pursue a policy of exclusion in our own island territories, would be embarrassing and possibly dangerous. The French own 600,000 hectares out of a total of 1,200,000 hectares of land. The natives own about 522,000 hectares. A French company known as the Society Francaise des Nouvelles Hebrides is the owner of the 600,000 hectares above mentioned, and in addition has been granted trading concessions in the group. The company is willing to sell its property and trading concessions for 25,000,000 francs (about £500,000). All the bases and ports except Port Olry form part of the company's land, and are susceptible of exclusive private ownership with unrestricted sea rights. The possibility of the sale to British ests has been disclosed to the French Government, and it is stated that the transaction will meet with no objection on their part. On this point I cannot speak officially. The purchase of this property by British interests would reverse the present position so far as dominant land ownership in the group is concerned, and such would pass from French to British control. It is understood that Japan is pressing the sellers for an offer failing Australian acceptance. On the 13th October a cable was received making an 1 offer to arrange payment by bonds maturing over five years-7,000,00 0 francs maturing the first year, 3,000,000 the second year, 5,000,000 each of ing years-bond s for full amount being deposited at time of purchase and maturing accordingly. It was added that if this offer did not suit, an endeavour to meet Commonwealth wishes would be made; but payment in francs was insisted on, or if in another currency in cash or security for which francs could be obtained now, in order to avoid possible loss of present advantageous exchange, which naturally greatly reduces the cost in sterling. On the 21st October a cable. was received stating that the company was holding a general meeting on the 27th October, and would greatly appreciate any information available before that date. No reply to this cable has been made. A further cable in the following terms was received on 1st instant:-""Ne w Hebrides Company state that failing immediate acceptance they must deal elsewhere. Please telegraph. Private American now trying to negotiate.""",21
28,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,What opportunity - will we have to discuss this offer?,22
29,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The House can have the whole of the day to discuss it. I want only to say that I am not in favour of the proposal, for the reason that I do not think that we could get a secure title to a great deal of the land.",22
30,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,This matter has been brought before us at the last moment. The Prime Minister tells us that it is urgent; but unless he moves that the paper be printed we shall not have an opportunity to discuss it.,22
31,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The House can discuss it today, and if it agrees that we ought to buy the land we can do so.",22
32,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I do not think we can agree to that, but we ought to have time to discuss the proposal. Will the Prime Minister move that the paper be printed ?",22
33,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Yes . The House may discuss the question today, hut I am afraid I shall not be here, because I have to attend the Premiers' Conference. The inter- reason why I am opposed to the acceptance of the offer is that I do not think the purchase of the land would place us in tie position suggested in the paper. Even if it would, whether the land itself is worth the money is a matter on which I am not able to express an opinion. I do not know the land. I know, however, that the Condominium, which it is proposed to continue, is most unsatisfactory. I shall make available all the information I hare.",22
34,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,It is wrong that this offer should be thrown at the House at the three follow- the eleventh hour.,22
35,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The matter was brought under my notice when I was in England, and I obtained an extension of the option in order that Parliament might have an opportunity to express an opinion'about it. I sent out a cable",22
36,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,Does this offer cover the whole of the Erench interest in the Island?,22
37,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I think so. In the paper I have read it is stated that the French own 600,000 hectares, and that is the area which this French 'company is prepared to sell to us.",22
38,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,But even if we did acquire in this way the whole of the French interest in the. lands of the New Hebrides that would not abrogate the control of the French over the New Hebrides. 1,22
39,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Quite so. The Condominium would remain exactly as before. The point raised by the honourable member is a vital one. Labour laws have been the real cause of the trouble in the past, and even if we did acquire this land the control would remain exactly as it is. It is an integral part of the Condominium. I have no doubt that the missionary societies would strongly favour the purchase of this land by the Commonwealth, but the question is whether we would be able to get a good title for it. If honourable members desire it, I will have prepared a statement giving a legal opinion, for what it is worth, as to our position in regard to this land if we acquired it, but I doubt very much whether we would get a clear title. All the titles to land must come before the Condominium Court. Honourable members know how that Court is constituted. ..If the natives said, ""We do .not admit that we sold this land,"" and the Court held that their contention was right, I do not know that we could get a clear title.",22
40,Mr GBEGORY,Unknown,"I suggest that the Prime Minister place on the table of the Library all the papers dealing with the matter, so that if any honourable member wishes to take up the question he may do so.",23
41,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I will place the whole file on the Library table. Honourable members understand, of course, that there may be in the papers references to another Power that ought not to be made public.",23
42,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"I understood that documents laid on the table of the"" Library were available only to members, but it has become the custom to allow the press access to them in such circumstances, and the press, in some cases, publish almost verbatim copies.",23
43,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"We could not allow that. A business firm has made this offer, and in this paper references are made to one of our Allies which I do not for one moment accept. That being so, if the file is placed on the table of ""the Library we must say, ""We do not believe these statements,"" although we are going to deal with the men who make them. I have just noticed at reference to a point I . have already made. The file shows that of the 600,000 hectares of land which we are asked to acquire, the title of the company to 376,000 hectares is established. The rest of the land is only partially marked out, and the titles to it are not established.' I shall lay such portion of the file as is proper on the Library table. I move That the paper be printed.",23
44,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [11.27] - ! do not intend to enter upon a discussion of the merits of this question, since, with the scant information at our disposal, it would be impossible to do justice to it. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), very late in the day, has given the House an opportunity to deal with it. He states that he has brought the matter before us now because of its urgency, that the offer was made to him while he was in the Old Country, and that he secured an extension of the option so as to enable him to consult Parliament.",23
45,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,And to make inquiries.,23
46,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The right honourable member has said also that he is opposed to the purchase of the land, and since that is his view it might have been said of him later on had he failed to take this action, that he had allowed the Commonwealth to miss an opportunity to acquire this interest in the New Hebrides. The offer was made some months ago, and we should have been given a chance before this to consider it. As it is, an endeavour should be made to obtain an extension of the option for some months, so that Parliament may deliberately deal with the whole matter. I am not committing myself in any way, since it would be ill-advised to express an opinion on a proposal of which one knows practically nothing. We have not the information to enable us to discuss the merits of the question at this stage. All we know is that an offer has been made by a Erench company to dispose of certain vested interests in the New Hebrides. It is prepared to sell 600,000 hectares of land to us for £500,000, but, in the absence of further information, we cannot deal with the offer. I rise now merely to protest against the Prime Minister's action in allowing this matter to remain in abeyance right up to the last moment, and then making it an urgent one.",23
47,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I do not make it an urgent matter at all.,23
48,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has told us that he lays the matter before the House, because he does not wish to be charged at a subsequent date with not having taken honourable members into his confidence. But what chance has the House to deal today with a question of this kind?",23
49,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The House really does not wish to deal with it.,23
50,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I do not say whether the House does or does not desire to deal with the matter, but if it is one of no great importance to the country the Government snould take the responsibility, and risk any strictures being passed upon them at a later period.",23
51,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The Government take the responsibility. Mr CHAELTON"" - Ha d the Government done, so there would have been 7iothing to say, but for the Government to place themselves in a position to say that they have consulted the House, when the House has had no opportunity to deal with the merits of the case, is a wrong procedure. Honourable members ought to be place.d in possession of the fullest sible information.",24
52,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"A month ago I gave House an opportunity to say whether it was in favour of wireless, and from day to this honourable members have never said one word about it .",24
53,Mr CHAELTON,Unknown,"Unti l the Governsension ment bring down a concrete proposal regard to wireless, the House is not a position to discuss the subject.",24
54,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,You have a concrete proposition.,24
55,Mr CHAELTON,Unknown,There is no prowhole position on the business-paper.,24
56,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The business-paper!,24
57,Mr CHAELTON,Unknown,"The Government which, control the business of the House, and arrange the business-paper, and if this subject is of such urgency, it should have been there given a place.",24
58,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"You have never asked good. any questions regarding it, and now, when I say I am not in favour of the proposal, you say there must be "" something in it .""",24
59,Mr CHAELTON,Unknown,"I do not say that, but, personally, the proposal does appeal to me at the moment. However, I know nothing about the merits of the proposal, and it is not fair to proceed in such a way that if the House makes a mistake, the House, under the circummillions stances, is to be held responsible. I submit that we ought to be given opportunity to deal with the matter in proper way.",24
60,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Herbert) [11.33] In 1915 a Royal Commission was apI pointed at the instance of the then Postthe master-General (Mr Mahon) to visit New Hebrides, and make inquiries into postal^ matters generally. Many plaints had been made with regard > to the manner in which Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company were conducting do mail service. A voluminous report was prepared by that Commission, and from it a good deal of information may be obtained regarding matters referred to in the document now before the House. Before leaving for Europe the then Prime Minister (Mr Fisher) suggested that the Royal Commission's inquiry should take a wider area than that of postal services, and embrace any matters in the New pos- Hebrides considered to be of importance; and the result was that the Commission presented two reports, which I suggest the honourable members should consult.",24
61,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [11.35]. that - Like the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) I have visited the New Hebrides, where a good deal of disand difficulty arises out of the in Condominium, in the administration in of which a Spanish gentleman was appointed Chief Justice for the settlement of land claims. If Australia is not content with the vast area within her own frontier^, and desires the of the New Hebrides, then by all means we ought to carry out this purchase. The area is 600,000 hectares, at 2 | acres to the hectare, means 1,500,000 acres. Considering the climate, with the heavy rainfall and the richness of the soil, the amount involved does not mean an expensive investment.",24
62,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Provided the title is,24
63,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"In purchasing land one always takes care that the title is good, and in this case ""we look to the Crown Law authorities to do their duty. not At a moment like this I may be excused for speaking plainly: If we think it wise that the French flag should be kept flying there on account of the danger from the north, where there are many massed, then I should be inmerely clined to agree with the view of the an Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). I shall the certainly require further information before coming to a decision.",24
64,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Dampier) [11.37] t is somewhat difficult to deal now with questions that have been placed before the the Chamber, and I hope that some honourable member will move the adjournment comof the debate, so that we may have an opportunity of discussing them on a future date with fuller information at our comthe mand. It appears to me that the main question is wliether the Prench company shall sell its rights and interests to the Australian Government, and we have very little information as to the real value of those rights and interests. Por a considerable time there has been anxiety connected with the control of the New Hebrides. The Condominium has nob been a success, and during the last six or seven months there has been much correspondence in the newspapers, particularly in the Sydney Morning Herald, on the affairs of the New Hebrides. Apparently the question of the Condominium and that of general control was considered some time ago, and it is in this regard that Parliament feels some anxiety; perhaps, more than in regard to the purchase of the lands held by the French company. This purchase may be essential, of course, to proper control, but without the fullest information it is not possible for honourable members to form any opinion as to the value of the option, and what action should be taken. If the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) feels any anxiety about laying these papers on the table of the Library, I suggest that he might make them available to honourable members in his own office, so that any one feeling a special interest, would be able to peruse them. I feel quite sure that if this debate be adjourned, and the papers are made available as I have suggested, a good purpose would be served, the Government could then at any time afford^ us an opportunity of an immediate discussion of the subject. Debate (on motion by Mr JOWETT) adjourned. WAR INDEBTEDNESS. FUNDING ARRANGEMENT-INTERES T CHARGES-SINKIN G FUND .",24
65,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. What are the particulars of the general funding arrangement made with the Government of the TJnited Kingdom on the 2nd February, 1921 ? 2. At what rate per cent, is the contribution £1,013,560 to the payment of the principal of Australia's war indebtedness to the Government of the TJnited Kingdom? 3. On what date will the loan he redeemed? . 4. How much of the £1,9S6,440 sinking fund on Loans for War Purposes (see page 355 of Estimates) is at the rate of i per cent, contribution and how much at the rate of 1 per cent,?",25
66,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"for Sir JOSEPH COOK). - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The total indebtedness of the Commonwealth under the funding arrangements with the British Government is £92,480,157, made up as follows:i i per cent. Bonds .. £11,500,000 3 i per cent. Book Debt .. 1,263,158 6 per cent.

The amount is applied in the first half year in payment of interest as follows:On £1,263,158, at 3$ per cent, per annum. On £11,500,000, at i l per cent, per annum. On £79,716,998, at 5 per cent, per annum, and the balance is taken in reduction of principal. In subsequent half-years, the amount is first applied in payment of interest at the before-mentioned rates on the balances of the principal sums outstanding, and the remainder is taken in reduction of principal. By this means, the indebtedness will be wiped out in Hoi years, or in 1956. 2 and 3. See answer to No. 1. 4. A lump sum of £3,000,000 is provided for sinking fund on war loans. Of this amount, £1,013,560 is applied to redemption of the indebtedness under the funding arrangements with the British Government, and the balance (£1,986,440) is to be paid to the Loans Sinking Fund. This latter payment represents a contribution of about J per cent, on the remaining war loans.

Senate's Request - Ad val., British, cent. t",25
67,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Richmond - Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.47] - I move That the requested amendment be not madeFor a number of years past a small fixed duty per gallon has been imposed on varnishes, and by that means we have built up, to some extent, the manufacture of low-grade varnishes. But, owing to the fact that the fixed rate represents an almost infinitesimal ad valorem duty on the higher grade of varnishes, nobody attempted, until after the outbreak of war, to manufacture them locally. During the war considerable progress was made in this respect, and we decided to provide for an alternative ad valorem duty upon high-grade varnishes, that being the only effective method of protection. The mere increasing of the fixed rate of duty would not achieve that purpose, because it would provide too high a rate of protection on the lower grades of varnishes, but would not give sufficient protection on the higher grades unless it were made so high as to become an absurd impost on the lower grades. The only way to give satisfactory protection to both classes is to have a fixed rate of duty on the lower grades and an ad valorem duty on the higher grades.",26
68,Mr GREGORY,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"On e authority points Q out in a letter, which no doubt the Minister has seen, that these duties range from 75 to 350 per cent.",26
69,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"That cannot be so when the schedule only provides for a duty of 25 per cent. What the writer means is that the 25 per cent, ad valorem duty is a 350 per cent, increase upon the protection formerly provided. The mere fact that a 25 per cent, ad valorem duty represents such a tremendous increase as the honourable member has indicated shows the utter absurdity of the fixed rate of duty on higher grades of varnish. MCWILLIAMS - Does not the 350' increase indicate a little ab",26
70,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"No , because the duty we are imposing is only 25 per cent. The fixed rate of duty is no protection at <all on the higher grades of varnish; it is merely a small revenue duty per gallon.",26
71,Mr MOWILLIAMS,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,Are the higher 15 per grades of varnish being manufactured locally ?,26
72,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"They are now. This industry was started as a result of the war and is growing. The Committee would be taking a retrograde step if it were to do anything to destroy what has already been achieved. If the manufac-' turers of high-grade varnishes abroad care to come here and set up their works, as manufacturers of other commodities have done, good luck to them. The more experience of that character we can gain the better ",26
73,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,How many local firms are producing high-grade varnishes ?,26
74,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,At least three firms are making them in quantity. TheTe may be other firms producing on a small scale.,26
75,Mr FOLEY,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,Does the Minister know what prices are being charged in Melbourne for local varnishes?,26
76,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"I have not those particulars, but I think the price charged for the local article compares favourably with the price charged for the imported varnish.",26
77,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,This is a line that affects the Government considerably.,26
78,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I have had no complaint from the Government.,26
79,Mr GREGORY,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I am advised that the trade has sent in numerous protests against the high duties.,26
80,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"I receive protests from all side?'-fro m the manufacturers that the duty is quite inadequate for their .purpose, and from the users that the duty is ruinous. Between the Scylla and Charybdis, represented by the opposing interests, the Minister 12478 Customs Tariff [REPRESENTATIVES.! has to steer what he considers a safe path. The 25 per cent, duty formerly agreed to by the Committee is reasonable; it .certainly is not excessive. I willingly admit that it is a considerable advance on the fixed rate of duty, hut I repeat that the latter is simply a revenue duty on the hligher grades of varnish, and does not produce the result for which we look.",26
81,Mr RICHARD EOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,From what countries do we import our varnishes principally ?,27
82,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"I should say that Great Britain sends us the bulk of the varnishes we use, but there is also a considerable importation from America. During the war large establishments for the manufacture of varnishes were brought into existence, and Mgh quality varnishes are being produced today which in years gone by the local manufacturer could not attempt to make. The Committee would do well to adhere to the duties to which it originally agreed.",27
83,Mr FOLEY,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Kalgoorlie) [11.55] This item provides another illustration of how .the ulfrra-Protectionlists, having, first of all, put as high a duty as they eould possibly get on the raw material, use that duty as an argument for increasing the impost on the manufactured article.",27
84,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,Has the honourable member forgotten that he was one of those who asked for a duty on the raw material from which varnishes were made?,27
85,Mr FOLEY,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"During the general discussion on the Tariff I said that I would vote for any duty which I considered fair, and throughout the schedule I have been consistent in my attitude. I have not voted to impose duties on articles simply because they were produced in my electorate, but that influence has been at wprk in regard to the local manufacture of varnishes. We have heard all the high Protectionists in this Committee express the desire that the manufacturers should get a fair price for their product, but I have heard very few say that they wished the. consumer to be supplied at a fair price.",27
86,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,That is the object of Protection.,27
87,Mr FOLEY,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"The Minister, when inwould troducing the Tariff, said that high Probeen painted. tection must mean an increase of prices. BM.",27
88,Sir ROBERT BEST,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Eo r a time. - Mr FOLEY - That time has lasted long enough. The varnish being made in Australia at the present time is sold at, say, 17s. per gallon. The British varnish, which this item affects, is sold at 34s. per gallon. Therefore, the consumers will be penalized by every additional penny of duty we impose. If the fact that the price of the British article is 100 per cent, higher is not sufficient Protection for the local product, .the Australian manufacturer is not worth his salt. Some honourable members seem to think that it is our duty to make' the imposts upon all imports as high as we possibly can. They are doling nothing to protect the users of varnishes. One statement has been made with the deliberate intention of injuring the reputation of imported varnishes. It has been said that the British varnish is thinned down after importation to a consistency of one in three. British varnish is left in vats for twelve or twenty-four months and then tinned in gallon measures and exported. It would be spoiled if any attempt were made to thin it down. I am told, not only by varnishing firms, but also by people who are excellent authorities on the subject, that it is not possible to do so. The only effect of increasing the duty will be to increase the cost of the best class of work. The Minister says that he is not in favour of having a fixed rate of duty on the better quality varnishes, but the Australian manufacturer should not require more than a fair handicap in the race of competition with the British manufacturer, whose output is absolutely necessary and is used on a great deal of Government work. A very unjust differentiation will be created by the adoption of an ad valorem rate on the higher quality varnishes. The oils used in some of the local varnishes are not of good quality. Any painter will admit that the linseed oil used at the present time is quite inferior to that which was imported in pre-war days. Quite recently I had the exterior woodwork of my house painted. I already had a 5-gallon drum of the old linseed oil, but the painter I employed used the ordinary linseed oil of the present time. In two months one not have known that the house had",27

Mr FOWI.EE - A painter told me the quest. other day that he would not use it.",28

In three months one would not have known that anything had been done to the lattice work. 1 had again to use some of British oil to go over that work. duty imposed should be sufficient put the Australian article on ing, with just a slight advantage in the competitive race with the imported article, but the present proposal before the Committee is absolute Tariff madness. The local article which is claimed be as good as the British article costing 34s. per gallon can be sold gallon, and yet the manufacturers want the duty increased. It is unreasonable. We are now building motor ear bodies, which require the very best quality of material. paints and varnishes. If Australian varnishes are used in preference to British, .difference can easily be detected in months. My contention is that if a man is anxious to do good work and is willing to pay 100 per cent, more for the best varnishes, that 100 per cent, increased should be quite sufficient to give tralian manufacturer an opportunity establishing the varnish-making industry.  Tariffist can argue that this particular affects their constituencies. duty is necessary to make Australia self-contained, that general shibboleth used by high Tariffists being blown out in this case because all the raw materials necessary for making varnish have to be imported. In these circumGovernment stances, the imposition of an increased duty for the purpose of establishing [497] unnatural industry will merely tend to increase the cost of living. Otherwise those who are engaged in polishing furniture and kindred occupations will be to work with inferior material as the better-quality article produced by firms elsewhere who have been established for centuries. This duty will not help Australia to build up a natural industry - Therefore I shall vote in the direction of agreeing to the Senate's re",28

He is like a lot of others who are staunch Free Traders on occasions and very staunch Protectionists when o something affects them personally or My friend tells the Committee that the Australian varnish is of an inferior quality. No one would suggest that the Victorian Railways would be prepared to use anything cheap and nasty. The whole tendency in services in making purchases of stores is to get the very best. Yet this an Department, having had the Australian varnishes analyzed 'by chemists and subjected to very high tests, has accepted them in - open competition for use on railway work.",28
96,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I have also a certificate from the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the South Australian Eailways. I hand it to the honourable member. He may quote it if he desires to do so.,29

Chief Medianicn 1 Engineer's Office. Dear sirs,-Wit h reference to smnples of varnishes received on 8.Lst January, 1920, I have to advise that these were put into use for trial on carriages issued to traffic' on 10th March, .1920, and 17th May, .1920, respectively, and they have given every satisfaction. 1I have therefore decided to add the name of your firm to my list of accepted manufacturers of varnishes in order that you may have an opportunity of tendering for this class of material when next we are in the market - Yours , &c, B. F. RUSIITON, Chief Mechanical Engineer. In South Australia Australian varnishes have been subjected to the actual test of use on railway carriages. If the firm on whose behalf efforts are being made is desirous of supplying high class varnish to the Australian public, let it establish itself in Australia. We should be glad to have it make varnishes here, bufc we should not, while it is merely an importing firm, give it an advantage over the local manufacturers of varnish - Surely Australian varnish is not to be condemned merely because the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Eoley) is not satisfied with the result which he obtained by putting oil on a house in Western Australia. As the raw materials from which varnish is made are dutiable, the manufactured article should also be dutiable.",29
100,Mr MATHEWS,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Melbourne Ports) [12.19] - During the Tariff discussions many misstatements have come from the Corner party, and now we have the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. Foley), a direct Ministerialist, proving that he is not particular about what he says, though a member of his long experience might be expected to weigh his remarks carefully. He said that Australian varnish is inferior to imported varnish because of the oil used in it. He found fault with the quality of Australian linseed oil. He said that that oil is not as good now as it was in pre-war days. I do not know that the honourable member would recognise good varnish if he saw it. I admit that I would not, though I might be able to say whether a job done with a particular varnish was a good or a bad job. Bad workmen are accustomed to blame either their tools or their material, and the honourable member, after varnishing a house, possibly laying on the varnish as if it were whitewash, appears to have been dissatisfied with the result, and blames the Australian varnish for it. When he was speaking there was within the Chamber a gentleman who knows something about varnish, he being a. representative of a Victorian varnish company. This gentleman says that the local oil has been very regular in quality.",29
101,Mr FOLEY,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Did he say whether the quality is medium, good, bad, or indifferent?",29
102,Mr MATHEWS,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,Le t us deal with one question at a time. T. hold that as we protect the varnish-making industry we should insist on the use of local oil in its manufacture.,29
103,Mr FOLEY,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,But what is the quality of that oil?,29
104,Mr MATHEWS,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Le t me deal first with the honourable member's statement that the quality is not as good now as it was in pre-war days; in otlier words, that it has been irregular. I wish to refute the honourable member's statement that the Australian oil is irregular in quality My authority, who knows something about varnish, says that it is his experience' that it has been very regular in quality. Those who use oils know that you can get inferior imported oils; that the imported oils vary in quality.",29
105,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,That is true.,30
106,Mr MATHEWS,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"But the honourable member for Kalgoorlie would not admit it. He must have used imported, not local, oil, because, according to my information, the local oil has been regular in quality, and of a fair sample. The suggestion of the honourable member was that before the war the Australian oil was good, but that in pure cussedness the local manufacturers are now producing a poorer quality.",30

Locally-made varnish is also used throughout our public institutions. We are justified in encouraging this industry.",30
110,Mr GREGORY,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Dampier) [12.2S] I have no objection to protection being given to this industry, but surely the Committee might well discuss the amount of protection to be given. I do not know, much about varnish, but I wish to see fair play. The Minister and the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) both evaded the point. 'We should not unnecessarily provide manufacturers with the opportunity of making enormous profits out of the public. The other day the Minister said that he had consulted [497]- 2 various manufacturers regarding the duty on perfumed spirits. But I am afraid that he has been badly advised in regard to matters of this kind. The Minister discussed very fully the arguments advanced in opposition to the proposals ins regard to perfumed spirits, and stated that the 'information obtained by his Department was that the higher duties were* essential. The manufacturers, he said,, had been consulted. He also told us this morning that the manufacturers of varnish had been consulted. I propose to> show by reference to a letter sent to the?

The Department, no doubt, has its own methods of obtaining information, and the Minister must take the advice of his officers, but I have 'here papers showing' that the statement made by the Minister that the manufacturers of perfumes had been consulted, was not correct.",30
113,Mr MATHEWS,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I think that the honourable member's papers must have been compiled by Free Traders.,30
114,Mr GEEGOEY,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"It is interesting' to note that honourable members opposite who favour high duties are not desirous of light being thrown on the subject. I have no personal interest in this matter, and the only information I have witli regard to it comes from an interested source. I have here a circular from W. Harland & Sons, and their agent here, who is naturally desirous of protecting h!is principal's business. In this circular it is pointed out that under the old duty, the amount payable on 93S gallons of varnish of the net value of £1,023 would be £117, whereas under the present duty £281 would be collected. Is such a high duty essential?",30
115,Mr MATHEWS,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"As a matter of fact, the importation of varnish ought not to be allowed.",31
116,Mr GREGORY,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"In other words, the honourable member says that we should not 'be allowed to trade with the Old Country. We should live entirely ito ourselves, neither importing anything nor exporting our products. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Eenton) took up that attitude with regard to agricultural machinery, and we now have the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) expressing the same view with regard to the importation of varnishes. The suggestion is absurd. That £281 should be collected by way of duty on varnish of the value of £1,023 is preposterous. If local manufacturers can- not carry on without such an enormous duty it is time that they closed down.",31

I hope the good sense of the Committee will lead - to the acceptance of the Senate's request. Surely a duty of 15 per ceut. under the British preferential Tariff is sufficient. We have no objection to the higher duties under the intermediate and general Tariffs, but we think a duty of 15 per cent, as requested by the Senate is ample in respect of British varnishes of the high value shown in the invoice to which I have referred. I know that the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) is a sturdy Protectionist anxious to build up Australian industry, but if the figures quoted by Harland & Sons are correct they suggest that the high duty under the British preferential Tariff would lead to the exploitation of the people, and I do not think he would support anything of the kind.

Por instance, a large quantity of marble of this class is used m the making of tables. It was a request from the monumental masons of Sydney which induced a member of another place to have this marble made free, but I may say that no request of the kind came from any other State. I ask the Minister to reconsider hi3 proposal. It is within my own personal knowledge that a company is being formed in South Australia to de? velop the white marble industry, and that already an order has been received for 12,000 table tops a year.

This company has offered to pay a deposit (or pTemhmi) of £100 to the Zinc Company if it will legally guarantee us of that position for a reasonable term, or that this company will not be in any way prejudiced by the duties, but the Zinc Company has declined to enter into any contract. I would point out that the Fertilizers Association and the Zinc Company 1ms closely connected interests, and the directors of the get co-operative eompany, which is not a member ourselves. of the Association, feel that if the duties are passed, tliey will be forced into one or other n.e.i.,"" of the following positions. That they will have to spend £100,000 extra on plant,' which means, a heavy levy on the primary producer who jnnst find this additional money; or pay concerned 20s. (or SOs.) per ton on fl to 20 tons of crude sulphur per day. In laying the above facts before you' the directors of the company feel that while they can rely on your assurance of the 21st July last to permit no inequitable acts towards the co-operative company, the latest position as above should be made known to you. In the first place the Phosphate Company is not guaranteed these concentrates, and, in the second place, if it were guaranteed of Aus- them, it would be compelled to erect for machinery to the value of £100,000. The company has a registered capital of £300,000, and it is not yet able to start operations. In order to erect the necessary plant to deal with concentrates, it will have to increase its capital to £500,000. It is not prepared to do that. The Electrolytic Zinc Company cannot supply the Co-operative Phosphates Company with sulphur - because sulphur cannot be made from concentrates; they yield only a crude form of sulphuric acid. If we have to importvolcanic sulphur or brimstone, the primary producers of this country will be penalized to the extent of fro m 6s. 3d. to 8s. on every ton of superphosphates used in the Commonwealth. Before the war the farmers were able to get the superphosphates at £ 4 7s. 6d. a ton. The price increased year by year until today it is £ 6 3s. per ton, notwithstanding the fact that bags The are only half the price this year that they were last year. It is said that this country should be self-contained, and that we should manufacture all the sulphur necessary for the purpose of making munitions of war, lest in the event of war we be not able to import munitions from abroad.",34
143,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,What proportion of existing output of superphosphates made in Australia is made with pyritic acid ?,35
144,Mr HILL,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I could not say.,35
145,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I understand that it is 30 per cent.,35
146,Mr HILL,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"That may be so, but if the Combine are to be placed in the favoured position of being able to get their pyrites, sulphur, or sulphuric acid at a price below that which the Phosphate Co-operative Company will be obliged to pay, the Committee should take off the duty.",35
147,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I have the assurance of the Electrolytic Zinc Company that the co-operative concern will be placed in exactly the same' position as any other buyer.,35
148,Mr HILL,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"We can get no assurance to that effect from the companies. The manager of the co-operative company's works writes as follows: The term """"brimstone"" should be used instead of the term ""volcanic sulphur,"" otherwise there is a probability of American crude Bulphur being held by the Customs Department to be not of volcanlic origin. It has not been geologically practicable to determine the origin of the American sulphur beds. proportion of ten tons of superphosphate to one ton of sulphur is not applicable to this company. Under our proposed system of working it is eight tons of superphosphate to one ton of sulphur. The Electrolytic Company is reported to have purchased 750,000 tons of zinc sulphides lying at Broken Hill from the British - Government, which had bought them for their zinc contents during war time, and is reported to have sold them at a considerable loss. Under the practice of the metal market it is improbable that either the British Government or the Electrolytic Zinc Company paid anything for the sulphur in these concentrates, as in that form it has no commercial value. It is unfair that the farmer should be made, by duties, to pay the Zinc Company for what it probably did not pay for itself. The sulphur must, in any ease, be roasted,out of - the sulphides as liminary to treatment for the zinc contents. In view of the stocks of concentrates held at Broken Hill and elsewhere, it is improbable that .the miner will, by increase of work, reap any benefit for many years. There is an iron sulphides deposit inland in New South Wales: but, owing to the cost of transport, such iron sulphides can have nothing but a local value. Honourable members opposite need not imagine that by adhering to this duty they are conserving the interests of the men working in mines. They are merely building up a huge concern that will not give a co-operative company an opportunity to live, to say nothing of reducing the the cost of production. There are already sufficient conoentrates on hand at Broken Hill to last for many years, and this duty will not improve the miners' position in any way. The following appeared in the Argus of the 26th October last: The British Board of Trade announces that it has instructed Broken Hill, to supply zinc concentrates, with the view of enabling British smelters to resume work. It also invites offers of concentrates, deliveries to extend over a period. [Under the terms of a contract entered into between the Zinc Producers' Association (of Australia) and the British Board of Trade, the Board was to take uip to 300,000 tons of zinc concentrates a year for a period of ten years after the termination of the war. Owing to the subsequent reductions in the price of zinc, the shipments to Great Britain were small, and although the concentrates - were paid for by the British Government, they were allowed to accumulate at Broken Hill. In September the Board of Trade sold 750,000 tons of these concentrates to the Electrolytic Zinc Co., Tasmania. Although no prices were stated, if. is understood that the British Government sustained a .serious loss under its purchase of Australian zinc concentrates. Under the contract deliveries of these concentrates to the Electrolytic Zinc Co. extend over several years. In August the British Government was stated The to have 056,000 tons of concentrates stacked at Broken Hill. Private adviice has been received in Melbourne that the British Board of Tradehas decided to take deliveries of concentrates, and sell them at a loss to the British smelters, Zinc with the view to the re-opening of the smelters, and thus assisting to relieve unemployment. Up to date shipments of concentrates have heen small, but instructions have been received to forward larger consignments.] It is quite plain that it is impossible to produce sulphur from concentrates. I have here some extracts from a letter written by Willia m M . Hamlet, an analytical and consulting chemist, of 32 Elizabeth-street, Sydney, which have more application to sheep dip than to superphosphates', but some of the argua pre- ments in which apply also to the matter now under consideration. They are as follow: Having jfiven some consideration to the problem of sulphur in Australia, and from my experience in the manufacture of sulphuric acid, the question appears to narrow itself down to the two following propositions:(1) The economic production of crude and refined sulphur in Australia. (2) The production of sulphur from the minerals now existing at Broken Hill, Tasmania, and various parts of Australia, and also whether the product would be suitable for use in the arts and industries. 1. The first proposition may at once missed, because no deposits of sulphur - exist in Australia. 2. The sulphur actually present in iron pyrites, copper pyrites, zinc blende, arsenical pritcs, gypsum, &c, are locked up, and economically unobtainable. Commercially, it is impossible to obtain sulphur from these metallic sulphide ores. The only use to which these sulphide ores could be put would be the manufacture of impure sulphuric acid for manurial purposes, and even then the process would be dangerous to life. . . . [ ask honourable members to take notice imipurities, o . that last statement. f",35
149,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,How can he reconcile that statement with the fact that in every country in the world except Australia these things are made with pyritic acid?,36
150,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,They are also made here with pyritic acid.,36
151,Mr HILL,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Mr Hamlet also says that pure sulphur is wanted in medicine and pharmacy and in the making of gunto powder. The manager of the Co-operathe tive Company writesWeak or impure sulphuric acid is practically of no importance in making modern explosives. All the plants established in England towards to the primary producers. the latter stages of the war were for "" oleum,"" a highly concentrated form of sulphuric acid. I am credibly informed that no oleum was produced in Great Britain during the latter part of the war from sulphuric acid. The British authorities preferred to use pure sulphur.",36
152,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I think that the honorare able member's information is incorrect.,36
153,Mr HILL,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"The letter proceedsThis oleum when added to nitre produces nitric acid. There is no nitre produced in Australia, so we could not possibly be self-contained in respect to this commercial commodity, even if we could produce pure sulphur from zinc or any other form of concenof trates. The letter proceedsIn the manufacture of munitions a mixture of nitric acid and sulphuric aoid is added purified cotton waste or similar material. The action of the nitric acid on the cotton produces nitro cellulose, the main constituent of explosives. Practically all the cotton the nitre used in England and Australia, imported, and in view of the comparatively small amount of explosives required for a population of, say, 6,000,000, it is futile p propose substitutes for them. mineral, and there are no known deposits of in Australia. - be disI have also a letter from Mr W . W . Dods, a metallurgical chemist and assayer, of Melbourne, who writes as follows:Sulphur (as sulphur) is not commercially produced from pyrites, ""but when pyrites is heated sufficiently high in presence of air, the sulphur which is combined with iron in pyrites is oxidized by stages to sulphuric aoid in the presence of water vapour and oxygen-giv.ing compounds, the sulphur being evolved as a gas, and finally converted into sulphuric acid. Sulphuric acid as used largely in the manufacture of superphosphate of lime. Sulphurie acid obtained from pyrites usually contains chiefly arsenic. Volcanic sulphur (free sulphur) lis used in processes of manufacture for making cattle dip, sheep dip, lime sulphur, sodium sulphide, and otlier products. Volcanic sulphur, or free sulphur, cannot be commercially obtained from pyrites. It all resolves itself into this: that the primary producers of Australia are to be compelled to adopt one of two courses. Firstly, they are to be compelled to use concentrates, and this they do not want do because of the expense attached to erection of a plant, which would cost £100,000, a.nd would probably not be running for the whole of the year. That would he a tremendous handicap Secondly, making if we cannot provide that amount, we shall have to pay duty equivalent to an impost of from 6s. 3d. to 8s. on every ton of superphosphate that we put out. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports and others have spoken of the machinery used on a farm, but the only rural machinery with which they familiar is the intricate machine known as the wheelbarrow. The farmers have to pay duties on everything that they use. It is the imposts on a thousand and one things that, i u the aggregate, must break their backs-as the last straw is said to break that of the camel. This may be said to be the "" last straws"" We have heard a great deal of the high cost living, and of the dearness of bread; it is not the farmer who is responsible for either. For the dearness of many comm o d it y it is the system of distribution to that is chiefly to blame. I do not say that the millers or the bakers are making high too much profit, or that the workers are and all getting too much; but when men are are being paid £ 4 , £ 5 , and £ 5 10s. a week for driving carts for the delivery of milk, to bread, and meat-and there are a dozen Nitre is a of these carts delivering in every street of it the city-the cost of the articles delivered must be high. Everything that the farmers are now producing is being produced at or below the fair cost of production. That is true of wheat, wool, butter, cheese, hay, oats, barley, onions, potatoes, eggs, milk, and f r u it . It has been contended here during the past day or two that higher duties are needed to keep our workers employed. I wish to see the workers employed, and wish them to get the highest wages that industries can reasonably be asked to pay. But I give members warning that the result of in creasing the price of agricultural machinery by the imposition of high duties will be that the primary producers-particularly the growers of wheat, who have had a moderately good time during the past four or five years, and have put what they made into increasing their plants-wil l in future buy as littl e machinery as they can. There will be no boycott of the machinery manufacturers, but stern necessity will prevent the men on the land from purchasing more than they can help. Speaking with inside knowledge, I say that the farmers need not buy many machines during the next ten years. The old single - furrow and double - furrowploughs and the 5 and 6 feet harvesters have been put on one side in favour of more modern appliances; but the farmers will not he able to continue to buy harvesters if they have to pay £ 2 0 0 , £230 , and £260 each for them. The proposed duty on sulphur will increase the load on the men on the land, among whom are many returned soldiers. Is that fair? I ask our friends opposite not to feed the fat men-the big men of Broken Hill and other places-to the in j u ry of the farmers. These duties will not benefit the miners, .they will merely put money into the pockets of those interested in the big mining companies.",36
154,Mr WAT T,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Balaclava) c think that the Minister is doing wisely accepting the amendment of the Senate. perty. It seemed to be a weakness in item 275. - as it left this House that it made vision for the production of pure sdlphur, or, as it is described 'here, volcanic phur. As for sub-item A (1 ) , which deals with sulphur n.e.i., I think that the best opinion in the Department and in the trade is that the proposed duties are necessary. I followed the honourable member for Echuca in the somewhat passionate .and forceful address which he made on behalf of the rural producers, whom he so earnestly represents, but T was not convinced by it .  wished to be.",37
155,Mr WATT,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"As a user of superphosr phates, I wish to get the best article at a low price. I think I use as much of this material as does the honourable member, and I am in a position to speak on the subject, although I - do not represent a farming constituency. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) naturally, though not quite clearly, divided his remarks into two sections-the national section, in which he dealt with the economic effect of the duties, and the defence section, covering the advisability or wisdom of making the country self-contained in time of war. As for the purely economic point of view, I think there is no reason why Australia, whose futur e will depend more on the wise use of artificial manures than upon anything else, should not encourage this industry. There are many things that have been done with or without the concurrence of the honourable member which are not so important.",37
156,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,Has Australia manufactured all her requirements in the matter of superphosphates ?,37
157,Mr WATT,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"F o r many years Australia, has imported superphosphates and sulphur for making them. Recently sulphuric acid has been produced in the country, and w-e are becoming more and more self-contained. I wish to see this process continued. As a result of the war, we authorized the Government to in vest millions of pounds in partnership . with . the Governments of the TJnited' Kingdom, and New Zealand in the mandated island of Nauru, and that pledges us to the support of the superphosphate [ 2 . 5 2 ] - I industry. If we are wise we shall take in our phosphatic rock from our own proKnowing how important crude sulphur and crude sulphuric acid are for no prothe conversion of phosphatic rock into superphosphates, should we be wise in sulallowing thousands of tons of sulphur to escape into the air from roasting works, to the destruction of all vegetable life in the surrounding country, when, by the application of modern scientific methods, we can arrest this waste? I was recently in South Australia, and saw the roasting work's which treat the ores fro m Broken Hill , as well as from ""Wallaroo and Moonta. The waste of sulphur hitherto has been criminal.",37
158,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,Is it not true that the use of this sulphur will make profitable mining ventures which today are unprofitable? Mr HIM . - But it is to be done at the ' expense of the primary producers.,38
159,Mr WATT,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"The honourable member has contended that because, for a considerable time to come, it is the metalliferous material from dumps that will be roasted, and not the newly-extracted ore, the mining industry as a whole will not benefit: but clearly, in the end, the mining industries throughout Australia will benefit in many ways. The more we make miningprofitable by saving and using waste products, the better for all connected with mining; the greater the profits of those who have money invested in the industry, the higher and surer the wages of those employed in it . The future pros-perity of low-grade ore deposits in Australia depends largely upon the selling to advantage of what have hitherto been waste products.",38
160,Mr RTCHARD FOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,Broke n and Wallaroo have been saving these products for years.,38
161,Mr WATT,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Yes , but we wish to in crease the saving to such an extent that we shall not have to import sulphuric acid - or brimstone.",38
162,Mr HILL,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,How much will it add to the value of mining materials?,38
163,Mr WATT,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"It will benefit the mining industry to the extent of the value of the hitherto waste products that are saved. I have heard complaints of the manner in which the superphosphate companies of Australia treated the rural producers during the war : but an examination of the facts has convinced me that more generous treatment was never given to any group of men than was given to the rural users of artificial manures by those controlling the output of superphosphates. Had all those who were engaged during the war in manufacturing or in vending goods acted similarly, there would have been nothing heard about profiteering. The honourable member for Echuca complains that superphosphates are dearer now than they were before the war. Well, everything that is manufactured is dearer. Wages have risen, freights and charges dependent on the cost of wages have risen, and as wages and freight charges are both big elements in the cost of superphosphates, these are dearer now than they were before the war. That cannot be a matter of complaint.",38
164,Mr EICHARD FOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"To be fair to the superphosphate companies, it must be 1 said that they have shown, with each rise in price, the details of tlicir increased overhead charges.",38
165,Mr WATT,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Precisely ! An examination of the trade should convince any one that no impropriety has been inflicted upon consumers by the manufacturers. Every rise in price has been conditioned by a definite expenditure to which they were committed. I doubt whether there is more profit now, per ton of output, than was made before ""the war ; indeed, I think there"" is rather less. There has been no profiteering. The liigher price today, compared witli pre-war rates, can be easily understood. Here is an important feature which the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) and those who think with him overlook: not far from the Australian coast we have huge deposits of Hill phosphatic rock. If we can get the other necessary elements fro m within our own country, and can manufacture them in combination with that rock and so produce commercial superphosphates, we shall be making sure of essential supplies for our own growers. The matter of surety is just as important to the farmer as the question of price. Germany found that out during the war period. It is my belief that the chief compelling element at the close of the Avar in Europe was the absence of superphosphates, for more than four years, in the German agricultural soil. Germany went down because tillage had become less productive, due to the absence of superphosphates. Germany was forced to her knees, apart altogether from Ihe military position, by economic pressure, which sprang from restricted rural production and the consequent shortage of foodstuffs. Surety of supply is to Australia, isolated as she is, even more important than it was to Germany; for she, in her Continental situation, could smuggle at least some portion of her most urgent needs across her borders, oven in the most oppressive years of conflirt. Germany imported no nitric acid during the greater period of the war, but she made her-own nitric acid, electrically, from the air. She did not quite secure the equivalent of her former mineral i m portations, but, by the application of modern scientific methods, she manufactured a substitute.",38
166,Mr HILL,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,That substitute cannot be manufactured here ,39
167,Mr WATT,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I am assured by chemists that such is not the case.,39
168,Mr FLEMING,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Can it be made in Australia as a paying proposition? Mv. WATT - It was not done, or in tended to be done, in Germany as such. It was an emergency measure forced by stress of war conditions, and I am dealing with that phase of the argument in reply to the honourable member for Echuca, who said that without importing nitric acid we could not secure our own supplies of superphosphates. I desire to see the manure industry protected, and I want to see the sulphur industry established in Australia. I do not think one genuine argument can be advanced to show why the Committee should depart from its support of the policy enunciated by the Minister and decline to encourage the establishment of an industry which would represent a great national asset. The question concerning how far the Cooperative Phosphate Company of Victoria oan be fairly dealt with under this duty is an important one, though not so important as the general issue. I accept the assurance of the Minister (Mr . Greene) that the firms concerned in. the production of sulphur for manurial purposes have given him a specific undertaking.",39
169,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I shall presently quote from a letter definitely bearing that out.,39
170,Mr WATT,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"I do not want to see company, co-operative or otherwise, squeezed out of business, because, while some are able to make arrangements with the sulphur producers, others cannot succoncentrates ceed in so doing. This Committee, and the Minister certainly, would regard such procedure as being unfair and inintimated vidious treatment. I have made indivisistance dual inquiries concerning the attitude the Electrolytic Zinc Company, and I have been assured'-jus t as the Minister concern. has been able to assure the Committeethat the manufacturers of sulphuric acid have KDecifically informed the Co-operathe tive Phosphate Company that the latter would be accorded exactly the same treatment, and be subject to precisely the same conditions, as any other similar concern.",39
171,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"I have a letter beforeme which states that at an interview with the Hon. W . L . Baillieu, at which Mr Gepp, the General Manager of theElectrolytic Zinc Company, was present, Messrs. Morton and Wolskel-the latterbeing the general manager of the Cooperative Phosphate Company-were assured that when they wanted concentrates they would be made available to the company on the same terms and conditions as applied to other Victorian concerns.",39
172,Mr WATT,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"I think it would be well to study the situation. The Electrolytic Zinc Company has given an assurance that the Co-operative Phosphate Company will be accorded exactly the same treatment as any other firm. The answer of the Co-operative Phosphate Company is that they do not wish to use concentrates for the reason that they would be involved in an expenditure of £100,000 in respect of machinery and the like. It will , apparently, be news to the honourable member for Echuca that the other manurial com panies advanced the same argument, and that the sulphurproducing concerns undertook to find the necessary money, and moreover, that they will do precisely the same for the Cooperative Phosphate Company.",39
173,Mr HILL,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I am not in this inner circle. They do not confide in us.,39
174,Mr WATT,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"I am not in any Combine, and have no interest in any such concern, but I have conceived it to be my duty to find out how certain basic enterprises are working, and whether their activities may be calculated to benefit or injur e Australian industries. any If the. Electrolytic Zinc Company are willing to deal on exactly the same terms with the Co-operative Phosphate Company; and if , in respect of the use of by the latter there Is difficulty in providing necessary capital, in any regard to which the Zinc Company have their preparedness to offer asalong the lines of capital charges, 9 of surely that must remove the objection from the stand-point of the co-operative However, while it may overcome the individual objection, it does not do away with the general objection; price of manures may be increased. But the offer, certainly, has effectually ""taken away the main argument of the ""honourable member for Echuca, that groups of companies are to get an advantage over one company. I do not think it wise that representatives of country interests should urge the weakening of the manure trade. Their best plan would be to advocate the manufacture within Australia of all the. superphosphate which can be produced to meet the requirements of the farming community. I have a good deal of sympathy with the farming representatives today, when they see prices for their products falling, and perceive this Tariff confronting them in respect of quite a number of items. But what is required is a long-sighted national view. For example, honourable members of the Opposition naturally desire to support and extend this industry in all of the industrial centres where works are and may be established. So do I . So should honourable members of the Country party, for the reason that, using our own products, the effect would be to warrant surety of supply of requisite quality, which is essential to the existence of primary industries. What would be the alternative? We would start to import foreign sulphur, wEich would be chiefly Japanese brimstone.",39
175,Mr MATHEWS,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I think the commodity can be secured more cheaply from the TJnited States of America just now.,40
176,Mr WATT,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"That may be; but whether supplies are procured from America or from ""Japan, the Australian policy should be to use Australian raw products wherever possible. And until it has been shown to be a bad policy I shall vote for the imposition of duties which will encourage that practice without inflicting serious in j u r y on any section of the community.",40

The Committee is dealing with an industry which Australia has had practically in her own hands many years-that is to say, importations have been very small. Australian agrithe culturists were well pleased when the Oommoinwealtih was given control over Nauru Island, but they have been someprimary what disappointed to find that their, generally. superphosphates cannot be secured any njpre cheaply today than in the past.",40
178,Mr WATT,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"There , again, increased freights must be reckoned with .",40
179,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"That is true, of course.",40
180,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"And meanwhile we have a very big monetary liability to carry, which in time, however, will have been liquidated.",40
181,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"I know that, and in any case we must turn to Nauru Island for our supplies. It is probably a matter of ten or twelve* years since we imported superphosphates from abroad. At any rate, very littl e of that product is being brought into Australia. In South Australia, the Wallaroo Company and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company have been recovering sulphur for some years. Other companies are following suit, but we are not getting sufficient supplies. The demand for superphosphates is growing, and must become even heavier. The Minister (Mr Greene) has asked this Committee to accept the request of the Senate, the effect of which, in part, will be torelease from duty whatever quantities of sulphur may be required for purposes of manufacture.",40
182,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,In cases where pyritic sulphur is not suitable.,40
183,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,A m I to understand that the product is to be duty free only so fa r as concerns its use for chemical purposes? That will not affect the manufacture of superphosphates.,40
184,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"I forgot to inform the Committee that I propose to accept the Senate's request with a modification that the imposition of the duty be deferred until 1st January, 1922.",40
185,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"The effect of such deferment, I take it , will be to give an opportunity to secure sufficient supplies on the present basis for next is season. I have listened carefully to the statements of the honourable member for In fairness I am bound to say that during the war the superphosphate concerns did not treat for Australia badly. Those who know anything about this business are aware that large companies are practically one, and provision must be made to prevent the exercise of their monopoly against the producer, or the public interest",40

199,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"I Jo not care where it was given, but they would not give me a written endorsement of it . in Adelaide.",41
200,Mr HILL,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,They will honour it only at the point of the bayonet.,41
201,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"I am not troubling about that, because there 13 a way of making them honour the undertaking. When we first used superphosphates for whaet-growing in this country, and had to import supplies, we were called on to pay far more than we should have been asked to do,- but that trouble was corrected by the Government of South Australia, and some of the State Governments, I believe, are . importing supplies for the farmers.",41
202,Mr WATT,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"If there is any doubt as to what these companies intend to do with the Coi-ope-rative Company, the Minister can get from them the required assurance in writing before this schedule leaves us.",41
203,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,We ought to have it in writing.,41
204,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I will do what the honourable member suggests.,41
205,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"My attitude with regard to the request relating to superphosphates, manufactured, will depend upon - there being a clear understanding regarding the matter immediately under review.",41
206,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I can only give it so far as the Electrolytic Zinc Company is concerned.,41
207,Mr MATHEWS,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Melbourne Ports) [3,21] - I have listened with great interest to this debate, and think that the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. Watt) has dealt exhaustively with the position. The Country party should be satisfied if they receive an assurance that the Farmers Co-operative Company will be treated the same as all other corporations. I know that the crude material withwhich they will be supplied will not be of much use to them, but if they are assured of the same treatment that is given all others, I - do not think they need "" growl."" If the companies dealt with, brimstone or volcanic sulphur they would need an establishment for that purpose and would not concentrate. Honourable members of the Country party always seem to fear that local manufacturers are against the farmers. The Minister has said that the parties interested can meet and make arrangements to prevent the application of the duty on sulphur being too premature. If that is and an arrangement is made which will not bear harshly on any one, there will not be much room for complaint. I come now to the health side of this question. So far as the workmen are concerned, no greater disability attaches to the produccan tion of flour sulphur than is associated with the working of the concentrates. If I thought there was, I should take stand agaiust this proposal. that it should be necessary for meu work in superphosphate establishments. The work, however, has to be carried out, and we must see that fair payment is made for it . The remuneration of the workmen in the industry is better than it used to be. Those who follow dangerous or unhealthy occupations should be well paid. My desire is proach that the men in this industry shall recause ceive adequate wages, and the farming section should not complain if ",41
208,Mr MATHEWS,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,The farmers should see to it that the men in this industry get a fair wage for the work they do. Honourable members of the Country party Watt). know full well that the farming section the community was saved by the manuused facture of superphosphates in Australia. Will any of them say that the farmers would have done as well had they been discussed. left to the mercy of the importers ? W i they deny that but for the manufacture of superphosphates in Australia the farconcentrates mers would have had to pay more for their manures?,42
209,Mr STEWART,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"I believe they would have had to pay more, and I am glad have local manufacturers of superphosturers phates.",42
210,Mr MATHEWS,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Then , in return for the safeguarding of the interests of many new industries. the farmers in that respect, I demand fair wages for the men working in the industry.",42
211,Mr STEWART,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,As long as they do howl at the same time for cheap primary products.,42
212,Mr MATHEWS,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"The honourable member is never tired of telling us that the farmers have to take the world's parity for their produce and to pay for productive. the protection . of secondary industries. Thelocal manufacturer of superphosconfers phates has protected the farmer, and my endeavour is to secure the same result from every protected industry. The Pardone, tners Co-operative Company should be protected, and I hope that it will secure the whole of the superphosphate trade of the Commonwealth. If the arrangements made prevent the co-operative company fro m being penalized, no exception be taken to this proposal. It is necessary also to see that the application of the duty will not operate harshly on a those who are using flour sulphur. The I regret position is an interesting' one, and if the to Minister's scheme succeeds he will have achieved, in respect of this particular item, what is absolutely scientific Protection. I hope that he will carry out this proposal in a way that will benefit considerably the whole community.  this item with all seriousness, be there can be no question that it is exceedingly foolish, in a country like Australia, to levy a duty on either manures or their component parts. I have to congratulate the Combines and those who are interested in this industry on having obtained the able advocacy of the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr . They have thus brought into of this Chamber a very powerful gun to be in their interests. Prom time to time in the board rooms of big companies in our large cities various enterprises are There were working difficull l ties associated with the Broken Hill concentrates, and the English owners of those suggested that they could be properly treated, and their various by-products extracted, provided that the assistance of a protective duty were secured. we Who is to pay this duty ? The manufacof manures will pay it in the first place, but will pass it on to the farmer. We have the same procedure in regard to Duties imposed for their protection are borne by the man on the land. No one will contend that the farmer in Australia is too prosperous, not and the spoon-feeding of this particular industry will have a serious effect on the whole Commonwen-lth. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) told us how Germany had found it necessary to produce manures in order to make the. country more Any one who brings into, this country a cheap bag of manure a benefit on the whole community; any one who makes it difficult to do that is an enemy to the country's best interests. I agree that the manure manufacturers acted fairly during the war period; they recognised the peculiar position in Australia. They experienced great difficulty in delivering phosphatic rock and sulphur to their various works, and the shortage of shipping added to their costs. But I ask honourable members to appreciate the facts. The farmers in Western Australia paid before the war £4 2s. Gd. per ton for superphosphates. I do not think that anybody can say that any of the men upon the land in that State, wliether growing root crops, fruit, or grain, were over-prosperous. On account of the extra cost of freightand other thiugs during the war, the price rose to £6 15s. per ton; but that high price, which was the result of abnormal conditions, continues today, and the farmers are paying it, notwithstanding that the prices of primary products are falling steadily, so that most of them are below the pre-war prices and many are below the cost of production. The use of superphosphates for growing wheat and other grain has revolutionized Australian production. That is the means by which we can add to the production of, not only wheat, but everything that comes from the cultivation of the land. It pays even the dairyman to apply superphosphates to his grass lands. It would be a fine thing for the Commonwealth to make manures available. We could then extend production for the benefit of all. The State Governments have recognised the importance of cheap artificial manures, and in Western Australia they .are carried on the railways at the lowest rates in the schedule. The State Government realise that the bread cast upon the waters in this way will return to them after many days. The Committee by this impost is asked to .allow the farming community to be further penalized. If the companies that are extracting sulphur ' are so important to Australia, let the whole people pay to help them by means of a bounty. I like to hear those honourable members who are farming in the cities of Melbourne and Sydney talk glibly, about the importance of the sulphur industry to the farmers. The honourable member  for Balaclava (Mr Watt) referred to the quantity of artificial manure he uses; I guarantee that it is not enough to bury himself in. He asked where would the Australian farmers have been during the war but for the locally-produced artificial manures? What a ridiculous question!. The whole of Australia depends on primary production, and when. that ceases, Australian settlement will revert to a few scattered villages and whaling stations. I do not know what the Committee will tax next. An effort is being made to tax out of existence every form of primary industry. This item and a later co-related item - manuresshould be free of duty. The - benefit which would result would not only go directly to the primary producer, but indirectly to the whole community. No other factor can be regarded as of greater importance than the factor of increased primary production. Any person who sends cheap manures to Australia confers a greatei* benefit on this country than on the country from which the manures come. Lands which cannot be profitably cropped under natural conditions can be made profitable by the application of artificial manures if they can be obtained cheaply. If the farmers are deprived of cheap fertilizers, Australia will retrogress. I desire to move that the Senate's request be amended to provide that sulphur or brimstone required for the manucheap facture of superphosphates be admitted free of duty.",42
213,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"If the honourable member desires to move in that way, I ask leave to temporarily withdraw my motion. Motion, by leave, withdrawn.  posedThat the requested amendment he made, but that all the words after "" purposes"", first occurring, in paragraph (A ) (2) be left out.",43
214,Mr FLEMING,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,Robertson) [3.45] - I ask the Minister to agree to postpone the further consideration of this item until the undertaking which the Minister has announced as having been entered into is brought here in writing.,43
215,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,I have no objection to doing so.,43
216,Mr WATT,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,Canno t honourable members accept the Minister's word?,43
217,Mr FLEMING,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Yes ; but a doubt has been expressed as to whether the agreement exists or not. We should he very chary about doing anything liaible to injure the manufacturers of manures ' in this country. They have stood up to . their obligations very well, and have turned out a first-class article, and are entitled to our support if they continue to produce a good article at a reasonable price. But honourable members in the corner are afraid that, as has been the case in almost every other matter affected by this Tariff, the primary producer will still be obliged to carry a heavier burden.",44
218,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,This duty will assist one branch of primary production very materially.,44
219,Mr FLEMING,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"If the Minister can assure us that the producers of manure will he able to meet the farmers as generously as they have done in the past, particularly during the war, there can be very little opposition to his proposal; but we want an undertaking that the primary producer, in whom we are more directly interested at the present time, will not have burdens piled on to him to an unbearable extent.. An y one who has watched the progress of this T a r i ff - through the Committee must recognise that the tremendous bulk of the burden imposed by it has been placed on the man who grows the raw product, and not on the man who manufactures it into the finished article. We simply want an understanding that the producers of manures will continue to treat the farmers as they have done in the past, and we want it in such a for m that there will be no doubt concerning it .",44
220,Mr MATHEWS,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,The undertaking is that the CoToperative Company will be for treated the same as others.,44

It has been shown conclusively that in this country we are making the very best arsenate of lead, and selling it at a price which compares favourably with the cost get of importing. The duty, as agreed to by the Committee previously, imposed no additional burden on any one, and at the same time enabled the fruit-growers of Australia to secure one of the best chemical sprays made from our own arsenic, of which there is plenty in Australia.

This gentleman is Mr R. E . Boardman, honorary secretary of Australian Conference of Fruit-growers.",45
226,The CHAIRMAN,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH," The honourable member will not be in order in reading a document dealing with the duty prepared by some one outside who, he says, knows the subject better than himself. - Mr HILL - I propose to quote f it extensively.",45
227,The CHAIRMAN,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,The honourable member may do that.,45
228,Mr HILL,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Unles s the orchardist prospers the orchard implement maker and the fruit-case maker cannot prosper. The smaller apple crop in Victoria this year partly accounted for the lack of employment in the hardwood saw-milling industry. The fruit-grower bears more burdens than almost any other class in the community. He not only takes his own share of the general duties, but is also called upon to pay duty on the raw material of the orchard implement maker. He is burdened with increased cost of cases and increased freights. He suffers more than do others in the community by the increased price of sugar. He is at the mercy of frost, hail storms, droughts and wind-storms, and also numerous pests. The only means by which he can cope with these pests is by spraying with arsenate of lead. Mr Boardman contends that the fruit-grower ought to be able to purchase any kind of spray, and should not be unduly penalized for using the imported article. I am not an applegrowing expert, but fruit-growers tell me that they have used the local article, in many instances with disastrous results.",45
229,Mr MAXWELL,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"On the other hand, you will find experienced men say that they have used it with every satisfaction.",45
230,Mr HILL,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"I am quoting the opinion of the Australian Fruit-growers' Conference, who surely ought to know their own business. However, at this late hour I shall not inflict this document on the Committee. I content myself by protesting against this high duty on arsenate of lead.",45
231,Mr FLEMING,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"Robertson) [3.58] The honourable member says that the fruit-growers bear more burdens than any other section of the community; they certainly do bear a very fair share of them, and their troubles are mostly pests, some native and some introduced, for which they must have the very best the sprays. Some people say that the localiyproduced article is good, but others, with very wide experience, do not care to say so. They are much in the same position as th© men who dip sheep. When we were debating the duty on sheep dip, some honourable members contended that the locally-produced sheep dips met all requirements. Others, for good reasons, r o m declared that they required imported dips.",45
232,Mr CORSER,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,They are all too conservative; they can believe in nothing but what is imported.,45
233,Mr FLEMING,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"It is all a matter of what pays one best. The fruit-grower has not a very great margin to work on, and he must use the spray which pays him best in keeping his orchard clean. So far imported sprays have proved better than the local makes. Senators did not take the b it in their teeth in this in stance, but, after considering the subject very carefully, decided that Australia would benefit more by having clean f r u it trees than by the establishment of one or two spray factories. All along this Committee has been giving the benefit to a few at the expense of the many. The f r u it industry has recently attracted many maimed men who are unfi t for other occupations. Men who have partially lost their sight or have been gassed have become fruit-growers. All these men are to be heavily taxed for the sake of a few persona in the cities.",45
234,Mr MASSYGREENE,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,We have given the f r u it growers protective duties going as high as 100 per cent.,45
235,Mr FLEMING,POSTMASTERS INNEW SOUTH,"The banana-growers, who do not require spraying machines, are heavily protected, but those who use these machines have not received much consideration. The banana-growers, and in some respects the citrus-growers, have been helped.",45
