1,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"An article inyesterday's issue of the Melbourne Age contrasts the vigour of the Postmaster-General's administration with the weakness of that of his predecessor. It states thatAlthough the new Postmaster-General been less than a week in office, he has already set his hand upon some weaknesses' ih administration that have been the source of considerable public inconvenience in the past. The article concludes with the statement by the honourable gentleman himself that ""the engineering staffs of his Department! must be as ready for all emergencies as are the members of the fire brigades."" Does he agree with the contrast in administration drawn by the Age, and will he ascertain if his predecessor likewise does so?",14
2,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"My business is too important, and the work of the Department too pressing, to permit me to answer such absurd questions. TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES.",14
3,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"It frequently happens that telephone subscribers are informed that they have been rung up by other subscribers who have given their numbers; but it is often impossible to"" ascertain to whom these numbers belong. Will the Postmaster-General, therefore, in issuing future lists of subscribers, adopt the practice which formerly prevailed in Victoria, of printing subscribers' names in numerical as well as alphabetical order, so that a reference to to the directory will show at a glance who is the lessee of any particular telephone? I think that many subscribers would be ready to pay a small sum for this information, if it could be given without extra expense.",14
4,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I recognise that if would be a convenience to telephone subscribers to have this information, and I shall inquire if it can be given without much additional expense. If it can, I shall be happy to adopt the honourable member's suggestion. ' NA MEDICINES.",14
5,Mr THOMAS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Has Mr Beale's report upon patent and proprietary medicines yet been presented to the Governor General?,14
6,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I received a telephone message from . Mr Beale this morning, saying that the report had been presented to the Governor General. The report has not yet come into my hands. I have ' promised that when it does, I shall lay it upon the table-of the House. PULMONARY PHTHISIS.",14
7,Mr LIDDELL,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"the Acting Prime has Minister, upon noticeIn the cases of how many prohibited immigrants within the meaning of sub-section (d) of section 3 of the Immigration Restriction Acts 1901-1905, has that provision been put in force on the ground that immigrants were suffering from pulmonary phthisis (consumption) ?",14
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"The reply to the honourable member's question isThere is no record of any person having been refused admission to the Commonwealth under paragraph (d) of section 3 of the Immigration Restriction Acts 1901-5, on account of suffering from consumption. Two persons suffering from the above disease were, however, prohibited under the provisions of paragraph \ i ) of this section, on the ground that they were likely to become a charge upon a public or charitable institution. CANCELLEDMAILCONTRAC T: But GUARANTEE.",15
9,Mr JOHNSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"the Postmaster General, upon notice Whether he will lay upon the table of the House all papers relating to the matter of the Â£25,000 bond in connection with the cancelled mail contract of Sir James .Laing and Sons, in pursuance of a promise made by his predecessor in office on the 10th of July last?",15
10,Mr MAUGER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I shall be very pleased to carry out the promise made predecessor, which was to lay the in question on the table when the is completed. DUTY ON TEA .",15
11,Mr KING OMALLEY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon noticeIn view of the fact that tea importers are now bringing tea into the Commonwealth in small packages of one pound put up in India, China, and other cheap labour countries, thereby depriving Australian white people of work, will the Government impose a duty on all tea contained in packages under the weight of twenty pounds?",15
12,Mr CHAPMAN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I shall be pleased to afford a definite reply to the honourable member at a later date. QUARANTINE BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 6th August, vide page 1468): Clause 4In this Act, Quarantine has relation to measures for the exclusion, detention, segregation, isolation, protection, and disinfection of vessels, persons, goods, animals, or plants, and having as their object the prevention of the introduction or spread of diseases or pests affecting man, animals, or plants. Upon which Mr Glynn had moved, by way of amendment-That after the word "" introduction,"" line 6, the words "" into the Commonwealth"" be inserted.",15
13,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Wilmot) [2.40] This clause gives the Commonwealth authorities very extensive powers. I admit that whatever authority is appointed to deal with such matters as quarantine and the preservation of the public health should be clothed with the fullest powers, for use in times of emergency, and we must trust that a wise discretion will be exercised in their use and administration. Whatever powers we give to a Commonwealth Department, they should be full and complete for the proper administration of the matters with which we wish that Department to deal. I doubt, if it be wise to give, at the present time, such large powers as are conferred by the Bill . I am not sure that we have the constitutional right to endow any Commonwealth Department with such powers. Therefore, the Government would do well to accept a reasonable compromise. It would not be right to put the States to the trouble of showing that this Parliament had exceeded its powers, and it would be a reflection upon us if the High Court by my ruled any of the provisions of a Commonpapers wealth Act to be ultra vires. Therefore, matter we should try to ascertain exactly what is our constitutional position in this matter. Not even the Attorney-General has shown that the Commonwealth Parliament can legislate with respect to more than the quarantining of human beings and animals. A memorandum upon a report by the Public Health Department of New South Wales has been placed before us, which contains this paragraphThe term "" Quarantine"" has long been used in England, in Australia, and elsewhere, as applying, not only to maritime quarantine in relation to human diseases, but also as to land quarantine and quarantine of animals. See Imperial Diseases of Animals Act 1S0.4, section 26, schedule 3, &c.; New South Wales Stock Act 1901, Pt. IV . , sees. 146, 151, &c; United States Act of 29th April, 1878, chap. 66. In that memorandum there is no claim that the Commonwealth can take any further power in regard to quarantine than may be exercised in the case of animals. At the Federal Convention of 1897, held at Svdney, Mr O'Connor, the present Justice, endeavoured to amend paragraph n of section 51 of the Constitution. He moved that the word "" quarantine"" should be omitted with a view to inserting in .lieu thereof the words "" public health in relation to infection or contagion from outside the Commonwealth."" Mr Isaacs, the present Justice, asked Mr O'Connor not press the amendment, and said I think that the meaning of the word antine"" is pretty well known. There is no gulations. doubt that leaving the sub-clause as it is preserves to every State the power that it now has to make laws in relation to all such jects. It does not vest an exclusive the Commonwealth to pass such laws. State can pass its own law, and alter it as it pleases; but I think it as well to do as was done in the Canadian Act in that respect, give a power which the Commonwealth might, in case of emergency, employ for the sake the general health-powe r to make a law respecting quarantine, as it is generally underas stood, so as to preserve all the ports of the Commonwealth, not only from infection abroad, but also from the danger of any tion which might have reached one port of the Commonwealth spreading to the rest of the Commonwealth. I think that there is no great harm in retaining the word "" quarantine,"" that, if we were to eliminate this word, day might come when we would very much regret having done so. The Hon. E. E. O'Connor : The sub-clause as it stands now provides for the quarantine of animals. The Hon. I . A. Isaacs : I believe it include the quarantine of animals if those animals when slaughtered would go. into consumption as food, and might thereby affect public health. The Hon. Dr Cockburn : What about quarantine of dogs? The Hon. I . A. Isaacs : I think that Federal Parliament should have the power deal with this matter if it thinks fit to do so. I quote this to show that when the stitution was being framed, the idea quarantine did not extend to plants or goods. Mr O'Connor withdrew his amendpresent ment after Mr Isaacs and others had - spoken; but none of the latter hinted for. moment that paragraph n conferred anyThe thing like the extensive powers proposed as followsunder this Bill.. Under the circumstances, it would be wise, I think, for the GovernareThenot Vegetation ment to take some notice of the States' treatment protests, and to come to the conclusion that there ought to be a central Commonwealth This body or Bureau of Immigration estabisolating lished, which should be assimilated with, or take over, the States bodies ministering the quarantine regulations relation to oversea communication. When a ship arrives within the 'Commonwealth the central authority should have the to inspect it, and, if there be either plants or anv other classes of goods on board likely to spread disease, the Federal authority should have power to impound them or 'deal with them as the occasion requires. moniously? But once the ship has been passed, and ithe goods or plants taken into a State Mr Atkinson. to a certificate to the effect that they are clean, then the States should be left to "" quardeal with them under their own local reMr KING O'MALLEY - Would not that subgive rise to conflict between the States and power in the Commonwealth? The Mr ATKINSON - Not necessarilv. If the Commonwealth, in the first'place, only to dealt with oversea quarantine, I do not think there would be any conflict, beof cause the Commonwealth, although acting the central authority, would utilize the States officers, just as these officers are now from utilized. In my opinion, we have not the infecconstitutional power to include plants and animals within the operation of this Bill ; and if we have not the power, it would not and be wise for us to assume that we have. the The States are already protesting against our action; and to take the proposed powers under the circumstances, would only give further reason for what, perhaps, may be unnecessary disquiet. That is not what we would desire. Possibly we are the powerful bodv, but, if so, we ought to make a generous the use of our power, and thereby strengthen the confidence which the States ought to the have in the Commonwealth. This is not a partu matter, and there is no need for the the Ministry to endeavour to win a party to battle. We are all satisfied, up to a certain point, that the object of the Bill is Concommendable, and that the measure is a of good one. I ask the Government not to go any further.than I have suggested at the juncture, because, in view of the fact that the States are now doing the a work exceedingly well, there is no urgency. last paragraph of the memorandum is Diseases Acts of the States affected as regards the extirpation or of diseases. The advantages of local legislation and administration are admitted. Bill , so far from diminishing their usefulness, will superimpose national measures for and localizing these diseases where, from the nature of the case, State action is now adlikely to be ineffective. in That goes to show that there is no need for the Commonwealth to take the proposed power at the present time. If there power is no urgency, why should the Commonwealth, simply because, possibly, it may have the power, seek to pass this measure in the face of the opposition of the States, with whom we ought to try to work harI f we introduce a system which works well the States will be all the on more ready to hand over further powers to us when occasion requires, which will be quite soon enough for the Commonwealth to assume the responsibility. If the Bill be passed as it now stands, the Government may be led to incur greater expense than the Treasurer anticipates. When he introduced the Bill, the honourable gentleman said he. did not anticipate there would be anv additional expenditure; and if the Commonwealth confines its attention to oversea matters, and eliminates plants and goods, we might obtain a very effective administration, probably at less cost, and certainly at very little more cost, than at present. There would be more effective contiol, because the central authority could arrange that a ship which had got pratique at Perth, could continue the voyage round to Sydney without further molestation. Under the present arrangement it frequently happens that a ship is inspected at each port, and the owners thereby put to much inconvenience and expense; while the new arrangement I have indicated would be a great convenience to shipping business, and lead to better administration from a Commonwealth point of view. Such a desirable result, in itself, affords another reason why we should not go any further than is actually necessary at the present time. If we persist in going further, there must sooner or later be a duplication of officers. For instance, if the Commonwealth thought, it right to assume the functions of'a State Department in opposition to a State's wishes, how could the Commonwealth ask that Department to act at any time? There would have to be fresh officers appointed; and, as I say, there must, sooner or later, be duplication. The fruit industry of. Tasmania, for instance, has been built up gradually, and is now under stringent and effective control by local bodies, who make their own regulations, appoint inspectors, and impose penalties. If diseased apples are allowed on trees a penalty is imposed; and every precaution is taken to keep orchard's clean, and to export only the best and soundest of fruit. The regulations go so far as to insist on cases, which may have been taken to the wharf, being dipped in boiling water before being returned to the. grower, There are different regulations in different neighbourhoods as the local conditions require; and the local bodies aredoing their work thoroughlv and enthusiastically, and far better than it could be done from the distant office of a central body..",15
14,Mr FULLER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Is it proposed to interfere with that?,17
15,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"It is not proposed to interfere with it;, but if the Bill be passed, in its .present form, it will certainly give the Commonwealth power to interfere with it. I say that there is no necessity for us to interfere, and the Government might very well limit the scope of the measure in the way I have indicated. To my mind, they would be acting wisely by so doing. For instance, it is well known that the fruit-growers in the Huon district were called upon to take up land which was covered by dense and heavy vegetation. They have laboriously cleared that land, but even now it i's practically valueless for anything save fruit growing. In many instances their whole lives have been devoted to assuring themselves a livelihood in this way. If their lands are interfered with as the result of some regulation, or if the industry in which they are engaged be threatened, they will have nothing to fall back upon.  member allow them to continue their avocation without check or hindrance?",17
16,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"They are not without check or hindrance now. They are subject to as sound regulations as can be devised. They areunder the strictest supervision at the present time, and, consequently, I contend there need be no apprehension that they will not do their best to keep their orchards free from pests.",17
17,Mr FOSTER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Will this Bill abolisb those regulations?,17
18,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"It will certainly give the Commonwealth power to interfere with the fruit-growers when, as a matter of fact, there is no need to interfere with them.",17
19,Mr FOSTER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,It is a question of administration.,17
20,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"That is so. But seeing that, in these particular matters, the States are discharging their duty so well, why should we interfere with their administration? What authority cando better than Queensland is doing in respect of the tick pest? I would"" be the last to urge the Commonwealth to.surrender its powers in any way. But because it has a giant's strength', there is no need why it should use it like a viant. In view of the fact that the States are efficiently discharging their duty in the matter of preventing the introduction of pests and/"" of disease, why not-seein g that this is at non-party measure-allo w the Government to take unto itself powers of quarantine in respect of oversea ships and animalswhich involve no constitutional questionleaving the control of plants and goods to the States, except at the ports of entry ?",17
21,Mr SAMPSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Why should we do that ?,18
22,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Because , if the matter came before the High Court, it is very questionable whether that tribunal would hold that the power of Federal quarantine extends to plants and goods after 'they have left the ship at the port of entry.",18
23,Mr FOSTER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Why pre-suppose that the Commonwealth will do worse than the Slates ?,18
24,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I do not pre-suppose anything of the kind. I simply maintain that the States are better able to deal with small local matters than is the Federation. They have more local knowledge, the local residents are more enthusiastic, and understand local conditions better. That being so, why should we interfere?",18
25,Mr BATCHELOR,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"The Bill would hit the local people, but it would not hit outsiders.",18
26,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"If the Bill be passed in its present form, the Commonwealth may, with the very best of intentions, do a vast injury to the fruit-growing industry, to which I have already referred. It has been said that the authorities in Queensland were somewhat lax in their efforts to deal with the tick pest. That may have been true in the early stages of the disease, but as soon as it was accurately diagnosed, and its effect thoroughly appreciated, that State was most active in its efforts to combat it. The Commonwealth could not have done better than Queensland has done during the past few years in attempting to cope with that f r i g h t f u l scourge. that the Government will adopt the view which I am expressing. I am sure that they can do so without any loss of prestige. I am satisfied that by acting in the way I have suggested they will be taking a wise step. As the occasion arises, we can afterwards proceed to legislate to the full extent of our powers if the interests of the Commonwealth, or of the States, should demand it.",18
27,Mr KNOX,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Kooyong) [3.7] - Every member of the Committee will agree with me that one of the most important functions which we were led to assume would be undertaken by the Federation was that of quarantine. It is perfectly clear that.the work of oversea quarantine can be most efficiently discharged by the Commonwealth, and I hold that one of the fundamental objects underlying the purpose of Federation was that the Commonwealth should discharge those duties which it could fulfil more effectually than could any of the individual States. Consequently I was of opinion that it would be a mistake for the Commonwealth to interfere with the local conditions obtaining in the various States, and with the arrangements which those "" States have already made. But I must confess that a closer consideration of this question has led me to believe that the Commonwealth should, in the interests of the public health, exercise such powers as would enable it - if by any mischance any of the States neglected to discharge their duties-to assert its authority. I do not think it can be laid to the charge of any State that it has neglected that primary duty. But at the present moment the States rightly or wrongly entertain the view that the Commonwealth Government has introduced a Bil l which, possibly, has a tendency to very seriously dislocate their internal arrangements. Consequently they say, ""We ask you to delay consideration of this measure before coming to a final decision upon it."" I think that without any loss of prestige the Government might have given greater consideration than they have done to the representations which have been made by the different States in - this connection. Representative bodies, whose members are desirous of seeing quarantine arrangements effectively carried out, have also requested the Government to delay the consideration of this measure until they have had an opportunity of making representations in regard to it. Protests in regard to it have come from Brisbane, from Sydney, and from various organizations in I hope Melbourne. The Commonwealth has been six years in existence without undertaking the very important duties of quarantine, and if there has been no need for it to exercise these powers during that period, it cannot be said that there is any extreme urgencv for their exercise now, or to push this matter to its final conclusion immediately.",18
28,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Why should the States manifest displeasure at the Commonwealth taking over quarantine functions?,18
29,Mr KNOX,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Let the honourable member ask them, and he will no doubt ascertain.",18
30,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Does the honorStates able member think their displeasure sonable under the circumstances?,19
31,Mr KNOX,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I will assist the Government to make the Bill an effective regard to oversea quarantine. In my view the object of giving this Parliament poiver to legislate in respect of quarantine thac it might control oversea shipping in that regard. That is the opinion which would probably be expressed by ing the worik well. the ""man in the street"" who has not grasped the necessity which exists to tect the public health, whether in respect of human, animal, or plant life. I hold that disease detrimental to health may be introduced - by means animal and plant life just as easily small-pox or plague may be introduced. I am sorry that the Minister in charge of the Bill is not present, because, notwithrity standing the assurances which he gave terday - assurances which undoubtedly modified the opinions entertained by a numwith ber of honourable members, and made those members more favourably disposed towards the Bill- I wish earnestly to suggest that whereas these enlarged powers may be secured by the Government, they should be accompanied by a declaration that they will not be exercised except in respect of oversea quarantine. The Commonwealth authorities should have power to follow up any importation into State under conditions which are thought likely to be detrimental to the public the health, and which cannot be dealt with effectively by the States themselves. while I feel that it is desirable that the Commonwealth should be able to take such action in cases of emergency, I think that we ought to have from the Minister an assurance that these additional powers not be exercised in any other circumstances. It is true that the Minister could not the actions of his successors. I . hold the kernel of the position rests in the ration having the most ample power, but fraining from exercising it beyond a certain point, except in an emergency..",19
32,Mr BATCHELOR,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Then the honourable member's position is that the Commonwhen wealth should have the fullest should not exercise .it?,19
33,Mr KNOX,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"My contention is that the Federal control should be limited to overamendment sea quarantine, and that its power to deal ber's views. with Intra-State or Inter-State matters should not be exercised as long as themselves are carrying out an efis reafective system of supervision.",19
34,Mr TUDOR,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"But in the event of the States failing to do so, should the Comone in monwealth have power to step in?",19
35,Mr KNOX,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,The Commonwealth should have power to step in when it is was shown that the States are not acting in the interests of Australia as a whole.,19
36,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,But the States are do,19
37,Mr KNOX,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Certainly . I claim that prothey are doing most effective work.,19
38,Mr ARCHER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"They are doing the work more effectively than the Commonwealth the public could' hope to do it. of Mr KNOX - The v are effectively carryas ing out the duties with which they are charged, but cases may arise in which action on the part of the central governing authois necessary to guard the public health. yesI should be prepared to clothe the 'Commonwealth with the power not only to deal oversea quarantine, but to step in and deal with Inter-State quarantine in cases of emergency, or when the States concerned were not taking reasonable precautions to safeguard the public health. I do. not propose to traverse the ground which has been so well covered by members of the legal profession in the House. I would not presume to deal with the constitutional aspect of this question, but I may say at a once that I think the Commonwealth should be prepared to take considerable risks from constitutional stand-point, in order that the health of the people may! be safeBut guarded. The provisions of this Bill go to the very foundation of the measures necessary for the preservation of the health of the people, and consequently, notwithstanding legal quibbles that may be Taised, will I am certainly disposed to say that we should be prepared to take some risk in bind the interest of the nation as a whole. that While the proposal that the CommonFedewealth should have Dower to quarantine replant life is regarded as being somewhat of an innovation, I think it is a power that should be possessed by it in order that the spread of disease mav be avoided. At the same time, it should be exercised only the States themselves fail to take power, but proper precautions. . Mr KELLY - The honourable member for Brisbane has already circulated an that meets the honourable mem",19
39,Mr KNOX,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I have not seen that the amendment, but am glad to learn that - steps are to be taken in the direction I have indicated. The limitation I suggest would be a wise one to impose. I trust that we shall be careful in dealing with this measure not to place any new obstacles in the way of trade and commerce between our various ports. It is admitted that the method of supervision so long in force in many countries is being 'somewhat relaxed in Great Britain, or, at all events, at the port of London, and I hold that we should be very careful not to impose what may prove unnecessary restrictions upon the free entry of large numbers of people to Australia. As far as is consistent with our desire to preserve the public health, we should remove all barriers to such an inflow. The Other day my attention wa3 drawn to an article which appeared in the Age in July, 1901, and which dealt with this question in a very able and satisfactory way. Capable articles are often published in that newspaper, and evidently the management considered that this one was eminently satisfactory, since . they republished it in globo in the issue of Wednesday, 4th March, 1903. The position taken* up by the writer is a just, reasonable, and rational one. After dealing with the whole history of quarantine, the article proceedsTlie British quarantine procedure, it will be seen, is eminently suited to modern requirements. It may be said to provide the maximum of precaution with the minimum of inconvenience, and hence on somewhat similar lines should that of Federated Australia be based. is required is an efficient system of medical - inspection for all vessels coming from infected ports, OT vessels on board of which sickness has occurred during the voyage. This inspection should take place at the first port of call the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, and it is then that the quarantine precautions should be initiated. Now, as a rule, the three diseases most dreaded in Australia are small-pox, plague, and cholera. Their introduction is most to be feared from Indian and Chinese ports. two first diseases named are, to a certain extent, now regarded as always more or less prevalent, and special precautions in this direction will be required. The method which will naturally suggest itself is that two Federal quarantine stations shall be established, the one for the purpose of supervising the health of vessels coming by our western ports, and this would have to be eitheT Fremantle or Albany, and the other coming by the eastern ports, either at Thursday Island or Cooktown. The duty of the officersdeputed by the Federal Government to carry out the quarantine regulations would be to hold an effective inspection on the arrival of any vessel from an infected port, or having sickness on board. If , on examination, actual cases are found, then the patient or patients should be landed, and the usual precautions taken to prevent any spread of the disease. On Mr Knox. the other hand, if the vessel is found to be free of disease, then a clean bill of health should be given that would prevent the trouble and waste of time that now frequently occurs in holding medical inspections at every Australian port at which an ocean-going steamer may call That appears to be good, sound, common sense.",19
40,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,The Bill itself provides for such a scheme.,20
41,Mr KNOX,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"The view put forward by the writer is to my mind a very sound one. His contention is that the scope of Federal power should be limited to oversea quarantine, and that I believe was the original intention. My only justification for addressing the Committee, after the full and able debate to which we have listened, is my desire to emphasize the reasonableness of the plea put forward by the States Governments, who say, in effect, to us, "" Do not dislocate the machinery that we have built up as the result of years of careful thought. Limit the Federal control to oversea quarantine, except in cases where it is necessary in the interests of public health to deal with Inter-State or IntraState quarantine."" If the Minister makes it clear that the administration of the Bill will be limited in that way, I hope that the Committee will give the Government an effective measure, sufficient to enable them to cope with any contingency, and to deal with any failure on the part of one or more States to carry out these duties satisWhat factorily.",20
42,Mr WILKS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Dalley) [3.29] - I agree with the honourable member for Kooyong within that we should give the Government an effective measure, and, that being so, I intend to support the clause as it stands. I think that the Ministry are proposing that which is necessary in order to secure The an effective system of Federal quarantine. According to some honourable members, the States are afraid that we shall exercise these powers too rigidly.",20
43,Mr ARCHER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,No .,20
44,Mr WILKS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Then of what are they, afraid ?",20
45,Mr ARCHER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,They are afraid that lack of local knowledge may cause the administration of the measure to be ineffectual.,20
46,Mr WILKS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Anothe r honourable member has told us that the States are relaxing their supervision. The objection that the present precautions will be relaxed is met by the. statement of the Minister that he is willing to take over the existing State machinery. If that be done, and the machinery now controlled by. the States is effectively operated by the Commonwealth, great good will ensue. In the first place, the change will benefit the Governments of the States, by removing from their control Departments which are now a charge upon their revenues. Public men in the States have declared that the Commonwealth Government is a costly affair, and we have now to show them how they can save money by handing over certain Departments to Commonwealth control.",20
47,Mr ARCHER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Is the Commonwealth to take into its service the stock inspectors of the States?,21
48,Mr WILKS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Thos e whom I represent are almost wholly consumers, and they ask to be protected from disease likely to be conveyed by f r u it and vegetables, as well as from disease likely to be conveyed by animals or man. I understand that the intention of the amendment is to limit the control of the Commonwealth to quarantine in respect to persons and goods coming from abroad or passing from State to State. In other words, those who support the amendment appear to be ready to go two-thirds of the way which the Government ask us to go. Why should they not go the remaining one-third of the distance, and give the Commonwealth power to interfere for the prevention of the spreading of disease within a State? I remember that, some years ago, it was found difficult to prevent the tick fever froni getting into New South Wales from Queensland, notwithstanding the robust administration of the Agricultural Department of the former State. gentleman, who was a Member of Parliament at the time, evaded the quarantine which was established by avoiding the well known crossing places, and driving 1,700 remounts across the border by an unusual route. I do not pretend to possess any technical knowledge in regard to this measure; but I shall vote for the clause as it stands, in the desire to provide effectively for the stamping out. of disease in every part of the Commonwealth.",21
49,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Wentworth) [3.35] - I cannot altogether agree with the amendment. As it covers the whole ground of the present controversy, I shall not now say anything about the constitutional aspect of the question, or deal with more than the point immediately raised, as to our right to take powers for the prevention of the spreading of disease withint a State, as well as the prevention of the spreading of disease from one State to another. I hold that under the Constitution we can endow a Commonwealth Department with the full powers proposed to be conferred by the Bill ; but I am also of the opinion that expediency must weigh with us in considering the advisability of exercising our constitutional powers. We should be very loth to endeavour to exercise the powers which the Government have told us they, desire to exercise through the local health officers of the States, because we cannot expect to obtain the service from State officials that the States get from them.",21
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"A similar arrangement under the Commerce Act works very, well.",21
51,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"The provisions of the Commerce Act are not so far reaching and extensive as those of the Bill . Does the honourable gentleman propose that the Commonwealth should take over the Stock Departments of the States, and pay the salaries of their stock inspectors? If that were done, and similar action were taken in regard to the Health Departments of the States, we should have to alter our financial arrangements under the Braddon section. But while I hold that it would be expedient to ask State officers generally to administer internal quarantine, I feel that we ought not to limit our powers in any way. The necessity may arise in the future for exercising these powers to the fullest, either because the States have exceeded their powers of local quarantine, or because they have failed to sufficiently exercise them. This matter, however, can One best be dealt with by. clause 13, and consequently I shall not speak at length in regard to it at this stage. I rose to ask a simple question of the supporters of the amendment- I refer to the second proposal, to insert after the word "" spread "" the words "" from State to State."" It has been generally accepted by the Committee that the adoption of that amendment would limit the Commonwealth to providing for quarantine on the borders of the States. Let us consider whether, as a matter of strict fact, the amendment would have that result, if it were made, the clause would readQuarantine has relation to measures for the . . . prevention of the . . . spread from State to State of diseases or pests affecting man, animals, or plants. ' A common-sense Court would interpret for that provision to mean that, to ""prevent"". the spread of disease from State to State, the Commonwealth could track it to its place of origin within any State. If a disease were allowed to spread through a State until it reached its boundaries, nothing the Commonwealth could do would '' prevent'' it from spreading to adjoining States. Consequently, the reasonable interpretation of the provision would give the Commonwealth power to track down disease to its place of origin within a and to deal with it there by any system of quarantine which it might choose to adopt.",21
52,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,The member for Angas says that the amendment to which the honourable member refers will prevent litigation.,22
53,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I do not think that it will; because it leaves the wording of the clause too vague. It is not my purpose to offer a captious criticism upon it, but for the reasons I have given, I shall be compelled to vote against it. I reserve right to so limit the power of the Commonwealth under clause 13 as to make Intra-State quarantine effective only when a State has failed to take proper, action, or has exceeded its proper powers in regard to quarantine.",22
54,Mr WYNNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Balaclava) [3.42] - I was very much impressed by the views put forward by the honourable member for Angas yesterday. He gave the Committee much valuable information. We require a powerful central authority to regulate quarantine, and I shall support the Bill as nearly as possible as it stands. In Victoria, at one time, the care of the public health was in the charge of local bodies; but it was found that on occasions their members were afraid to exercise their powers for fear of offending persons in the district over which the Board had control. The Legislature, therefore, felt compelled to institute tral Board of Health, with power to override the local bodies, which have since been altogether wiped out, the Health Act now being administered by a central department located in Melbourne. This arrangement has been found to work well, and every one is pleased with the change, although, when first suggested, it was opposed by the local bodies. What is proposed by the Bill is a , similar change, although on a larger scale, and, similarly, the State Departments are objecting to the control of a central Commonwealth Department.",22
55,Mr TUDOR,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Has it not been found that the Victorian Board of Health has not sufficient power, and that it could do better work if it had moie power?",22
56,Mr WYNNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"It has more power than it originally possessed, and has done great good by exercising that power. Possibly it would do more good if its power were extended. We do not want to have in existence two sets of authorities. If we State, have both States Departments and a Commonwealth Department, the friction which will be caused should the Commonwealth Department attempt to coerce the States honourable Departments will create more unpleasantness and ill-feeling than the transfer ' of the sole control to the Commonwealth. My view is that the Commonwealth should take over the Departments of Quarantine and Public Health. In my opinion, they would be better administered by one central authority than by independent State authorities. Has the Commonwealth been unable to properly adthe minister the Departments of the Post Office,. Customs and Defence? Are those Departments not as well conducted as they were by the States ? I think they are.",22
57,Mr TUDOR,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Better :,22
58,Mr WYNNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I cannot say that the administration of these Departments is perfect; but I believe that a central governing body would manage quarantine quite as well, if not better, than do the divided authorities of the several States. There are local jealousies already. We have Western Australia endeavouring by a side-wind to keep out fruits from other States.",22
59,Mr HEDGES,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,That is in order to keep out the codlin moth.,22
60,Mr WYNNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Probably Victoria has taken a similar step in relation to Queensland bananas. I do not say that Victoria a cen- has behaved any better than has Western Australia or South Australia in this connection. But the Commonwealth being the superior authority, the more power that is vested in the central body, the better it will 1 be for Australia as a whole.",22
61,Mr BATCHELOR,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Has the honourable member any idea of what the cost would be?,22
62,Mr WYNNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I cannot see that it should cost any more to administer Australia as a whole in the matter of quarantine than it does to carry on the administration of the different Health Departments of the States. If any one would take the trouble to ascertain what the cost is at present, I am satisfied it would be found to be more than would be entailed under a central body; and certainly the administration of the latter would be more in the interests of the public.",22
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,I gave particulars as to the cost in my second-reading speech.,23
64,Mr WYNNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I have not the figures in my mind. At any rate, honourable members would do well to support the Government, and to avoid so legislating as to give the States power to act on exactly the same lines as the Commonwealth- a policy which could only give rise to much friction.",23
65,Mr BOWDEN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Nepean) [3-47]-.There would appear to be two questions before us. First, there is the constitutional question, which has been very exhaustively discussed by honourable members, who, in this House are, perhaps, the most capable of discussing it. I do not desire to go very far' into that question; but I find that the honourable member for Angas, in reply to an interjection by the honourable member for Parkes, said he was not sure whether the Commonwealth could constitutionally take up all the powers sought under the Bill, although he was prepared to "" chance it . "" The honourable member for Kooyong was also prepared to say, "" Let us .risk this departure."" That, in my opinion, is a wrong attitude for the Committee to take. It would be more in consonance with the dignity of this Chamber for us to be sure of our ground before we move; while any false step will only put us more and more in conflict with the States Governments, and invite captious criticism and litigation. So far as the word ""quarantine"" is concerned, I do not think there is any doubt that we have not the powers sought under the Bill. It has been argued, however,, that we have additional powers under the provisions of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce. I am willing to admit that a great deal that is not contained in the provision relating to quarantine may be found in the provision relating to trade and commerce. But we find that the regulations in regard to trade and commerce in Canada and the United States ""are almost entirely, if not exclusively, in regard to Inter-State trade and matters of that description. The honourable member - who submits the amendment, and, I think, the majority of honourable members, are willing to give the Government power to regulate Inter-State quarantine. The only question on which 'we come into collision is whether we should exercise what are called the police function of the States in regard to matters within the States themselves. That is a course which, in my opinion, we are not called upon to take at the present time, even if we have the power. There are steps which may or may not be lawful, but which may not be expedient; and this, I think, is a step which it would be inexpedient for us to take, seeing that such matters can be better administered by the States than by a central authority. We all agree that there ought to be central administration in regard to what may be termed quarantine proper-that is maritime quarantine-so as to prevent the introduction of diseases dangerous to human, animal, or plant life.. These are matters which could be dealt with by the Commonwealth, and Parliament ought to take - the necessary power; but when we come to interfere with the States in the exercise of their present powers-power s which, at any rate, the majority of the States are exercising well at the present time-w e are on another footing altogether. There would be much difficulty in administering the law if we took the full powers proposed in the Bill. The Acting Prime Minister, when he introduced the measure, said I frankly confess that it has been found somewhat difficult to devise a means of doing this effectively aud inexpensively, and I hope that when the Bill becomes law we shall find it possible to work harmoniously with the States As to taking over the machinery of the States, I understand from what the Acting Prime Minister said, that he referred to the quarantine stations and to the health officers, more especially those employed in these stations. I do hot think for a moment that the Acting Prime Minister proposes to take over the administration of the Public Health Acts, the Nuisance Prevention Acts, the Cattle Slaughtering Acts, the Stock Acts, the Fruit Pests Acts, and'similar statutes of the different States; it is inconceivable that the Commonwealth could administer those Acts in the way they are being administered at the present time. All those powers ought to be left to the States, which possess all the necessary administrative machinery. The States Governments have at their disposal the municipal councils, and the health officers appointed by the councils, and also the police, who are often used in enforcing regulations made under such Acts as I have mentioned. The Commonwealth could not avail itself of this administrative machinery, and could not supersede it ; the only course open would be to either duplicate the machinery, or leave ourselves absolutely in the hands of the States.",23
66,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Is there not another course, namely, to keep a reserve power in case of the States either exceeding or not carrying out their powers?",24
67,Mr BOWDEN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"But the only way in which we could enforce such a power would be by some sort of machinery, and by officers responsible to us, and not responsible to the States, and such machinery could not be created without incurring a great deal of expense, and, possibly, creating financial difficulty.",24
68,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"In the case of the States not carrying out their powers efficiently, would the honourable member, merely on the score of expense, not allow the Commonwealth to proceed?",24
69,Mr BOWDEN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"No ; but I cannot see that at the present time it is necessary to. take such a.power. The administration of the States is increasingly effective; and we do not desire to create extensive administrative machinery merely in order to meet such an emergency as has been suggested. Our experience is not that the States do not enforce their Acts, but rather that they are apt to go too far.",24
70,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"And there, again, another power is necessary for the Commonwealth, is it not?",24
71,Mr BOWDEN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Even if in times of panic the States Governments go too far that is better than their not going far enough. What we have to look to is the effective protection of the people troduction and spread of the diseases and pests mentioned. In the case of the Commerce Act, we allow the States to do their own work by experts, and under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, we deal only with matters concerning more than one State; and we ought to act on the same broad principle in the Bill before us. If we do that, we shall have done all that the Commonwealth is called upon to do at this stage; and for the reasons that I have given, I am prepared to support the amendment.  after the lengthy discussion which has taken place, I feel somewhat in doubt as to what course I shall take with regard to the amendment. We have had two or three splendid addresses from the legal point of view; but the speakers appea* to be in conflict upon a very important point. The amendment of the honourable member for Angas commended itself to my judgment; but an equally eminent' member of the legal profession, the honourable member for Bendigo, told us that if we adopt the amendment it will simply shatter many of the subsequent clauses of the Bill. We have no desire to bring about that result-w e would rather accept the measure, and endeavour to make it perfect. I apprehend that the desire of the Committee is to assist the Government in carrying into effect what is undoubtedly an essential part of our constitutional powers. But there appears to me some doubt as to what the Bill is de-' signed to accomplish. Legal members have presented the Bill to us as one containing powers designed to be concurrent with certain powers which the States will possess, even if the Bill becomes law, and will still continue to exercise. That was certainly not the view presented to us by the Acting Prime Minister when he introduced the Bill. I have the Hansard report of the honourable gentleman's speech, and it seems clear from what he said that the intention of the Government is to take over the whole control of quarantine. The honourable gentleman said It is, perhaps, unnecessary to remind honourable members that we have at present six different State laws dealing with quarantine, and - every one will admit it is unwise that the existing system should continue any longer than is absolutely necessary. At a later stage, the honourable member for from the in- Parramatta askedWhat powers of quarantine will be preserved) to the States if this Bill be passed? To that question the Acting Prime Minister repliedI have made inquiry, and am advised that no power will be preserved to them. Consequently it is clear that in the opinion of the Acting Prime Minister we are going to take over the wholepower of quarantine, so that in future no power in that connection will be vested in the States. At alater stage of the debate, the honourable member for Franklin askedIs the Minister advised that the CommonwealthGovernment can quarantine one part of a State as against another without the consent of that State ? The Acting Prime Minister repliedI am so advised. Therefor the intention of the Bill is that the Commonwealth shall assume absolute control of all quarantine arrangements^ including the internal control hitherto exercised by the States. To my mind, it is perfectly clear that if we do take over these functions we shall have done very little more than take over quarantine arrangements so far as the ports of entry are concerned, because no provision has been made by the States for the quarantining of districts or portions of a State. If anything of that sort becomes necessary, action is invariably taken by their Stock Departments, and not under quarantine regulations. Therefore I think we may accept this Bill, which is particularly designed to assume control over existing quarantine arrangements, and from that Stand-point I am prepared to support the Government proposal. I believe that this work can be - discharged to better advantage by the Commonwealth than it is under present conditions, which appear to me to be likely to create difficulties. Only in today's newspapers a report is published of a discussion which has pust taken place in the South Australian Parliament. That discussion had reference to the introduction of the fruit fly, and to the objection which is entertained by the State authorities to the importation of apples from New South Wales. Some honourable members of the South Australian Parliament expressed the fear that if the State Government prohibited the introduction! of apples from New South Wales because of the presence of fruit fly there, the latter State would resort to reprisals by refusing to allow fruit from South Australia to enter Broken Hill. That is one of the difficulties which is always likelv to arise where conflicting authorities exist, and, in matters affecting the whole of the States, I am inclined to think that, it will be in the interest of the general community to secure administration by the Commonwealth. Of course, it may happen that, owing to the establishment of a central authority, we shall not be in a position to secure prompt action in certain' cases. That is one of the difficulties associated with the establishment of an authority which is called upon to govern a very large area The danger which I apprehend is that, in some instances, a disease may evidence itself iii one portion of a State, and before the central authority can be induced to move the area of infection may become enlarged, so that it will be more difficult to cope widi it than it would have been if action had been taken earlier. That, however, is a matter of administration. Unfortunately, Government Departments are proverbially slow to move. I do not know whether they are quite so slow as the average man credits them with being, but I do know that, in many instances, it is very difficult to get them to move. In cases where disease becomes manifest, and requires to be grappled with expeditiously, we must talke care that our organization is such that its services may be called into active exercise at the earliest possible moment. I am quite prepared to support the Bill. Concerning the amendment, I scarcely know what action to tike. Upon its face, I feel inclined to agree to it . But I should like to hear from some member of the legal profession how it would Jbe likely to affect the Bill, because I do not desire the prediction of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo to be realized. We must be careful to guard against that, and, therefore, as a layman, I should like to hear a further expression of opinion upon the subject.",24
72,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Franklin) [4.7] I shall support the amendment. The Acting Prime Minister states that he has an amendment which he may move, but he declines to say whether or not he will move it until clause 13 is under consideration. I do not think that this Committee actually wishes the Commonwealth to interfere with the internal arrangements made by the States in respect of ""health matters and the control of pests. The position I take up is that I desire to see the Commonwealth assume the control of quarantine matters in regard to oversea shipping and as between State and State. But I would point out that if we undertake control of the matters which are now dealt with by the State authori- ties under their Quarantine Acts, we shall not deal with one tithe of the subjects over which they exercise supervision. If we are going to deal with diseases in fruit, why should we not deal with slaughtering operations, and with other matters affecting the public health, which, in some States, are incorporated in their Police Acts, in others in their Vegetation Diseases Acts, and in still others in their Pests Acts? The object of the major portion of this Bill commands the support of honourable members, but I would ask them to recollect that in all the States pests have been dealt with by special"" legislation. When the Acting Prime Minister tells us that he intends take over the existing State machinery relation to quarantine, he overlooks the fact that the larger portion of that mafruit chinery is not included in the States antine Acts, but in their Codlin Moth Acts, their Vegetation Diseases Acts, and their Pests Acts. Consequently, we shall have to devise special machinery to give effect to the provisions of this Bill. In dealing with these matters, it occurs to me that would be well for us to have regard to the experience of other countries. I do that not know of any Federation which pests has assumed control over all these subjects to the extent that we are invited to do. After an experience of years, the United States of America has left them entirely in the hands of the Legislatures. That is the case, notwithStates standing that in America plagues have been these pests. experienced for nearly a century, and the question of quarantine has come into very much greater prominence than it has in Australia. Matters of local concern, can, in my judgment, be dealt with better local boards than by a central authority. Our States Parliaments have found that local bodies can deal with pests such these to which I have referred better can the State authorities themselves. the industry in which I am particularly interested, in order to cope with various diseases, it has been found necessary to move the power of control from the central State authority, and to vest it in local bodies. To that end, local fruit boards have been established which have been granted enormous powers. These have charged their functions better than any tral authority-whether Federal or Statecould hope to discharge them. It may news to some honourable members to learn district a quarantine that in Tasmania these Fruit Boards have power to tax orchards up to ios. per in addition to all State and municipal tion. The object of granting them power is to enable them to insist upon the orchards being kept clean. Yet even there it is not possible to secure uniform control. For instance, one Board has found it necesValley sary to make spraying operations compulof shipment, would be closed. sory, whilst in a neighbouring district it not been deemed desirable to insist ipon compulsorv spraying. In Tasmania, very stringent legislation exists in regard to internal arrangements of the State. For stance, the Codlin Moth Act, which was amended in 1891, makes it penal for any Mr MCWilliams. orchardist to convey from one part of the. to State to another-that is, from his own orin chard to his own yard, if there be a highway intervening-an y infected fruit. That must be destroyed in"" the orchard itQuarself. At varying periods inspectors visit the orchards, and if diseased fruit be found in them the offender is fined. The orchardists are thus obliged - to employ a number of boys and girls to - pick diseased fruit from time to time, and to destroy it. What it machinery will the Federal authority have to carry out any such arrangement ? I repeat the legislation dealing with these fruit is not embodied in the quarantine law ' of the States, but in such Acts as the Codlin Moth Act, the Vegetation Diseases 100 Act, and the Pests Acts, and we have no power under a general Quarantine Bill to' States take over the arrangements made by the in connection with the suppression of",25
73,Mr GROOM,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,It is not proposed to interfere with the police powers of the States.,26
74,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Then what machineryshall we have to create to carry by out the * intentions of the Bill ? This does not provide for police inspection.,26
75,Mr GROOM,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I used the term "" police as powers "" in a technical sense, and not in than the sense of powers exercised by conIn stables. I am referring to powers relating to the preservation of public health.",26
76,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Do I understand refrom the Attorney-General that it is not proposed under this measure to interfere with the local boards appointed by the States to prevent the spread of insect pests? I greatly fear the power to issue disregulations proclaiming any district a cenquarantine district. The Federal authorities will have power by regulation to probe claim any orchard or any part - of a district, and as long as the quarantine continues, not acre, one bushel of fruit may be sent to taxaor from that district. If , as the this result of an outbreak at Glenorchy or Bridgewater, those places were declared a quarantine district, the only right of way between the whole of the Derwent' district and Hobart, its sole port Not a has bushel of apples could pass through that quarantine district, and the result would be that the whole of the fruit produced the there would have to rot in the orchards. inWe' are assured that no Minister would think of taking so drastic a step. The Minister has told us that he does not intend to do. anything of the kind. in framing such a measure as this, we should take care to give the authorities no more power than we think, they ought to possess. We should not have regard to any question of whether the Minister who would be called upon to administer it is favourable or unfavorable to the industries to which it relates. I am sure that honourable members do not think that the Commonwealth authorities should have power to inflict an absolute wrong upon all the fruit-growers in a district by ^proclaiming a quarantined area in the circumstances I have stated. It is not necessary for us to give such powers to the Government. The States Governments themselves have found that it is sufficient to confer on local boards the power to do all that is necessary for the protection of the industries to which they relate. "" In Tasmania local bodies, created under Acts which will not be affected by this measure, have the most extensive and far-reaching powers. They can compel a man to keep his orchard clean, and if he refuses to do so their officers may enter that orchard, and destroy the trees in it . Is anything further necessary ? this Bill we might have a regulation applying to the whole of the States, and, in passing, I may say that I am inclined to think sometimes that the demand for uniformity is destined to become almost a curse in Australia. We might have a regulation that was quite applicable to Queensland or New South Wales, although its effect on other States would be disastrous. The authorities might frame a regulation suitable to Tasmania, but wholly inapplicable fo the conditions prevailing in other States. When the danger of uniformity in this respect is brought under the notice of the authorities,"" they reply at once,, "" We cannot differentiate between the States. We must have uniform regulations."" The demand for uniformity in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department is carried to an extent to which .no business man would be a party. United States of America have found it wise to refuse in many cases to pass uniform regulations. The varied climatic conditions of that vast continent render uniformity impossible. Australia we have an even greater variety of climatic, conditions, and since as the result of an experience extending oyer 100 years, the Government of the United [53] But States have found it absolutely necessary to leave wholly and solely to the States the passing of regulations relating to the quarantining of frui t pests, I think that we should be prepared to follow their example. Some of the ablest constitutional authorities in the House have declared that the Government are proposing to go beyond their power in this respect. But I do not intend .to deal with the constitutional asoect of this question. I recognise that there are certain functions relating to quarantine which the Commonwealth should exercise. I think that every honourable member is prepared to give the Federal Government power to deal with the general question of oversea and Inter-State quarantine, and surely it would be wise for the Minister to refrain from seeking additional power at the present time. Throughout the electorate which I represent there is a feeling of unrest in connection with this proposal. Their experience of the working of the Commerce Act has not been such as to lead them to believe that further interference, on the part of the Federation, with local matters is by any means desirable. This Bill , in Under s.o far as it deals with pests affecting plant life, is of the utmost importance to orchardists. We are dealing here with the very bread and butter of men who have carved out for themselves homes in the bush. Everything they possess is repre-' sented by their orchards. They have made a success of their industry without State assistance, and they simply ask us to leave them, alone. They have shown that they can manage their own affairs far better than the Federal authorities could hope to do. They have done much better than even the State Governments eould hope to do in taking measures to preserve their industry from the various pests that from time to time assail it. It is because of this that the Government of Tasmania have seen fit to vest the local boards with complete powers, and those powers are 'exercised in order to preserve the industry, in which members of the boards, and those Ths whom they represent, have embarked practically every penny they possess. We need not fear that such men are not likely to take the necessary steps to prevent the introduction of pests calculated to sweep away their' In means of earning a livelihood. We know from bitter experience that Government interference in these local matters has been attended by disastrous results. The Acting Prime Minister has said that it is not the intention of the Federal Government to interfere with the local bodies; but is it wise pass a law with the deliberate intention that no machinery to give effect to it shall be created? Under the system prevailing in Tasmania an inspector of a local board may also be employed as a rate collector or secretary of a road trust, and may, perhaps, exercise half-a-dozen other functions. Under the Federal control, however, new machinery would have to be created. We should require new machinery in order that the Act might be properly administered. The orchardists view with alarm the possibility, not only of a more rigid quarantine system, but of the passing of uniform regulations that may break down the barriers they have thought fit to create for the protection of their industry. The Government should be content to acquire general powers of oversea quarantine and quarantine as between State and State, leaving Intra-State matters to be dealt with for the time being by the local authorities. As an honourable member has said, the question is not so much one of legality as of expediency. I do not think any one would say that under this Bill the system of quarantine relating to the suppression of fruit pests should be more rigid than it is in my electorate. I doubt if it could be more thorough, and in these circumstances, I ask whether it is wise for the Federal Government to seek to run counter to public opinion. I have never raised in this House the question of whether it is wise for the Federal Government to come into conflict with those of the States, and I am not dealing with this question from that stand-point. feel that we often make a mistake in speaking of a State Government when we have really in mind the people who have elected us, and to whom we are responsible. This is a question between the Federal Parliament and the people who elect it. Unless we think that some great advantage will be secured by the Commonwealth Government clothing itself with these additional powers, I do not think that we should go out of our way to provide them, and thus create in the minds of our constituents a feeling hostile to the Parliament. On Saturday last, I addressed a very large meeting at Glenorchy, near Hobart, which was attended by representatives of all the fruit-growing districts. The unanimous request made by that meeting was that the local bodies should be left to deal with all local questions reVr. MCWilliams. lating to the introduction of fruit pests. to I hope that the Government will see their way clear to accede to that demand. If they would agree to eliminate from the Bill the clauses relating to plants and insect pests affecting plants, I believe that the remaining clauses would be passed through Committee in a quarter of an hour. I told the Acting Prime Minister on Friday that I did not think there would be much objection to the Bill if he would agree to such an amendment. I do not believe that the Federal Government require this additional power, nor do I think that if they secured it they would exercise it as* effectively as the States are now doing. If it is not the intention of the Commonwealth Government to carry out what I may call the police duties necessary for the proper exercise of the .powers conferred by the Bill, I fail to see what will be gained by passing the measure.",26

78,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"The Government of Tasmania has not found it necessary to have a reserve power in regard to the inspection of orchards, and has thrown the complete responsibility for the proper administration of the law upon those who make their living by fruit-growing. The man who has put all his capital into an orchard has so much at stake that he will do more to bring about the proper observance of the law requiring the keeping down of fruit pests than will be done by any official.",28

There is no need this legislation, and the Bill has already created great friction and alarm. : copies of it throughout my electorate, have since been overwhelmed with telepared grams and letters conveying resolutions public meetings held in the fruit-growing districts. The people there unanimously condemn it, and ask Parliament to allow the orchardists to manage their own affairs.",29
87,Mr GROOM,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Hav e they looked at the matter from the Federal point of view?,29
88,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I think so. They certainly have not been subjected to any outside influence. They realise that this Parliament is being asked to do what State Parliament was asked to do. The late Sir Edward Braddon obtained for the Tasmanian Government certain powers in connection with these matters; but it has since been found necessary to hand them to local authorities, who exercise them well. If pressure cannot be brought to bear on a State Government to compel persons possessing a few fruit trees to keep them clean, pressure could not be brought to bear on the Commonwealth Government to do so. The provisions of this measure,, if it be agreed to it stands, must be administered largely through the Customs Department, as the provisions of the Commerce Act are.

89,Mr STORRER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Launceston) [4.37] I have listened attentively to the debate, and think that the honourable member Bendigo gave us a splendid speech last night, although 1 regret that he referred the State management of quarantine, and suggested that the authorities of Queensland and Victoria have not always done their [53]- 2 to duty in this matter. Whatever law or regulation may be in force, there will always be the possibility of faulty administration, because mistakes are always liable to for occur in any matter under human control. The Constitution empowers this I sent Parliament to pass laws in respect and to quarantine, and we should be pre. to exercise that power. Not only of is it necessary to pass laws for the prevention of the spread of disease communicable by animals and human beings, it is also necessary to prevent the communication of disease by plant life and goods. Twenty years ago, when small-pox first broke out at Launceston, the infection was believed to come from clothes which had been taken from a lodging-house, and put into a store for twelve months, because it was the man who unpacked them who was first smitten the with the disease. An instance like that shows that measures for the prevention of, disease cannot'be effective unless they re'late to goods as well as to animals and human beings. It has been said that the authorities of the States can administer health and quarantine laws better than they could be administered by the authorities of the Commonwealth. That argument has been used by the present Opposition in regard to all sorts of proposals; but when the members of the Opposition party were supporting a Ministry, they took an oppoas site view. Whatever outsiders may say, it is not for us to declare ourselves incapable of managing the affairs of the Common",29
90,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,I pointed out that from it has been held in Tasmania that local bodies can deal with fruit pests better than There can can the State Government.,29
91,Mr STORRER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"If the Government of has found it better to give the I administration of certain legislation to betboards, what should prevent the Commoni f wealth from doing the same thing? I am altogether opposed to the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Bristo bane. Steps for preventing the spread of must be taken immediately. If his amendment were agreed to, the Commonwealth would have to wait until a State had refused or neglected to take action. If small-pox were reported to have broken out for at Mildura how long would the Commonwealth be expected to wait before taking acto tion-a ' day, a week, or a month ? I should be very sorry to see a clog put on the wheel of Commonwealth action in the manner proposed, and would rather leave the whole responsibility to the States. If the amendment were carried, the States would excuse themselves by saying, "" We did not take action because we expected that the Commonwealth would do so."" Wherever there are two authorities, there is confusion, and maladministration. The arguments of some honourable members, if pushed to their logical conclusion, would prove Federation to be a mistake. Is it not a fact that the Federal Parliament has been able to provide for the effective management and administration of the Postal Department?",29
92,Mr BATCHELOR,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,That is a highly centralized business which was a going concern when we took it over.,30
93,Mr STORRER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"This Parliament represents' the united wisdom of Australia, and if we are able to provide for the proper administration of the Postal Department, we can provide for the proper protection of Â«.the public health. I am not in favour of any of the amendments which have been suggested, because I think that the greater the powers of the Commonwealth for the protection of the public health the better. I hope that the Bill will pass as it is printed. Some years ago, when smallpox broke out in Launceston, the people of Hobart isolated the 20,000 inhabitants of that city, putting up barriers on every road, and even preventing the bakers' carts from going to the quarantine station to take bread there. There was a panic'in the southern city, and its citizens wished to injure those of Launceston. That is shown by the fact that, although there has been plague in Sydney on several occasions since, the Hobart people never tried to prevent vessels from coming from that port to Hobart. In a small community, one section will take action to injure another; but under wider control such petty jealousy cannot have effect. I therefore hope the Bill will pass as printed, and that much good will be accomplished by its means. There has been too much diversity of opinion in the past as to what is proper quarantine. For instance, in Tasmania it was for years impossible to import a beast from Victoria unless it remained six months in quarantine, and cattle sent from Victoria to agricultural shows on the mainland could not return to their own pastures before undergoing a similar quarantine. By Federation we have adopted a system of Inter-State free-trade, and, therefore, the.'Commonwealth should have full control of all quarantine matters, because many of the restrictions placed on movements of cattle and goods between State and State have simply meant protection. It is time that we removed the numerous borders and boundary lines which are at present recognised, and secured a wider and purer Federation. Personally, I was in favour t of 'complete unification of the whole of Australia, and I have seen no reason to alter my opinion.",30
94,Mr BATCHELOR,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Boothby) [4.46] The honourable member for Bass, and others who have spoken, seem to have a remarkable faith in the benefits likely to result from Commonwealth administration. Such a faith is simply touching, in view of our experience of some Commonwealth Departments. The Honourable member for Bass asks why we have federated if not to create centralization and uniformity; and he contends that the combined wisdom of all Australia must, of course, be greater than that of any small locality. Quite so; but that same argument could be applied to the question of how the roads in Launceston should be metalled. Nobody will deny, however, that the metalling of the roads is a matter that can' be much better decided by the people of the town. Some quarantine administration deals with matters of purely local concern. Why, then, bring to bear the whole machinery of the Commonwealth ? Why use a steam hammer to crack a nut? The only persons who are affected by, or have any interest in-, the spread of plant diseases from one State to another are those engaged in growing plants: the general community take an interest only in so far as they recognise that such diseases, damage the industries of the orchardists and others. Fruitgrowing districts are widely separated, and have greatly varied local conditions; and the people of the localities have, of their own accord, imposedall kinds of restrictions in order to prevent the spread of disease. The objection to Federal administration is not a fear that the latter will impose greater restrictions, but that it will not impose sufficient restrictions. It has been contended that the Commonwealth is more likely to act than the States; but the contrarv is the case. The small local todies might be induced to act, when the huge machinery of the Commonwealth Government could not be moved. The bigger the machinery, and the more numerous the Departments, the less efficient administration there will be.",30
95,Mr STORRER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"The bigger the machine, the more effective the result.",30
96,Mr BATCHELOR,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"But it is not necessary to have a portable steam-engine in order to draw a child's go-cart; and, in any case, I question whether the huge Commonwealth machine would be the more effective. The best plan is to give the big work tp the big machine-to reserve the Commonwealth machinery for oversea quarantine and quarantine as be- tween State and State. Under no conceivable circumstances could the Commonwealth devise any better administration than can be found locally at the present time. All that the Commonwealth could do would be to ask the local inspectors or officers for advice. If that advice were not acted upon the Commonwealth administration would be shown to be less efficient than the local administration, and if it were acted upon, Commonwealth interference would be shown to be .unnecessary. Honourable members talk in the most airy fashion about the necessity of our taking the widest possible powers. What is the good of those wide powers unless the intention is to interfere in local administration? We have all the reserve powers we want in the Constitution now, and no Act of Parliament can give us more. The only results of Commonwealth interference would be to create difficulty and disturbance where there is now harmony.",31
97,Mr ARCHER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"And to remove the sense of responsibility from local people. - Mr BATCHELOR - That is an important point. At present the whole responsibility is thrown on the people, who have to be constantly moving the States - Governments in order to secure complete protection. If that responsibility be removed, there will grow a general feeling that everything is in the hands of the Federal body; and the tendency of that, of course, will be to encourage rather than to restrict the spread of disease. I should like to hear some practicable proposal. The district which I represent is largely interested - in fruit-growing, and when any proposals are made for an alteration in the conditions of the industry I want to see some improvement as a possible result. do not see that a proposed change will be followed by improvement, but, on the contrary, may possibly lead to harm, it is my duty to voice the opinions of my constituents. We are here as the representatives of local men.",31
98,Mr TUDOR,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Australi a first.,31
99,Mr BATCHELOR,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Yes, Australia first; but Australian prosperity is made up of the prosperity of the units. If the prosperity of any parts of Australia is injured by some Federal action, then, of course, Australia as a whole is injured. We have been told that the Commonwealth ought to take the widest possible powers, but ought not to exercise them. In my opinion it would be much better not to specify those powers in an Act of Parliament. I do not believe that it is possible for any statesman, however able, to devise regulations, especially in regard to diseases of plants and stock, so as to give the satisfaction that is now given by the administration of the local authorities. I intend to support the amendment.",31
100,Mr ARCHER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Capricornia) [4-59]-I should like to emphasize the remarks of the honourable member for Boothby, and to point out that for the Federal Parliament to take power to interfere in internal State administration of quarantine, is not to make for efficiency. This is not a matter of Federal or anti-Federal spirit. I believe in the Federal Parliament taking over to the widest extent the powers which we can the more efficiently administer. I need not even mention oversea quarantine, because that, together with Inter-State quarantine, we all admit, should be under Federal administration as the more efficient. It is necessary to have some supreme power to prevent a State so administering, its quarantine laws as to practically impose a prohibitive Tariff, as has been clone in certain instances in the past. But in regard, to internal and local matters I am satisfied-and I may inform honourable members that I have had considerable experience in regard to the quarantining of stock-that the States can administer regulations much more effectively than can any central authority. Fbr tffat reason I intend to assist those who propose to restrict the exercise of the Federal authoritv to Inter-State and oversea quarantine. To my mind, it is purely a question of securing expediency and efficiency. I had a considerable experience of the' tick If I trouble in Queensland, and in that connection obtained a very good knowledge of how the stock quarantine regulations are administered. My experience of those regulations, even when they were administered from a centre like Brisbane, and affected a distant portion of Queensland, was bad enough. But the difficulties which were' then encountered would be intensified one hundred-fold if an attempt were made to administer similar regulations from a remote centre like Melbourne. It is in the interests of the whole community that the administration of such regulations should be in the hands of some authority as near to the different centres as possible. For that reason, I shall support every attempt which is made to confine Federal action to Inter-State and oversea quarantine. I trust that honourable members will regard the matter from that stand-point. It is not an anti-Federal matter, but simply one of securing the greatest possible efficiency, and of engendering the least possible friction between the States and the Federal authority.

Mr WILSON fCorangamite) [5.10] - It is very necessary that we should clearly set out in this clause that ""officer"" means a duly qualified medical man where diseases affecting human lif e are in question, and. .a duly qualified veterinary surgeon where diseases affecting animals are concerned. This is not a matter which should be dealt with by regulation. It is quite impossible for ordinary Customs officers to deal effectively either with diseases affecting human l if e or with diseases affecting animals.",31
101,Mr JOHN THOMSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,What would honourable member suggest should be done in cases where neither the services of a medical man nor a veterinary surgeon were available?,33
102,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Such cases, I presume, would be dealt with by the Customs officers.",33
103,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"This provision is subject to regulations, and in some cases it would not be possible to obtain the services of qualified men ",33
104,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I wish it to be made perfectly clear that in all cases where it is possible to do so-at all the ports of entry into the Commonwealth-the services, of properly qualified men should be procured. In Victoria, from time to time, the Stock Department has been under the control of men who were not qualified veterinary surgeons, and in many cases the work bas been done in such a manner as to permit of diseases spreading. Mistakes have bee'n made which would not - have been made by properly qualified veterinary surgeons.",33

106,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"That is correct, ibut such an examination does not qualify them to act as veterinary surgeons. A chemist has a considerable knowledge of therapeutics, and an even greater knowledge of pharmacy, yet the possession of that knowledge does not qualify him to act as a medical practitioner. Under this measure, an ordinary Customs officer may be a quarantine officer.",33

110,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"That is true; but the fact that Mr Garran has expressed certain views does not preclude us from discussing the advisableness of inserting in the Bill provisions that will make quite clear our intentions in this respect. I think that we should insert in the definition of ""officer "" words showing that our intention - is that a quarantine officer shall be a duly qualified the medical man.",33
111,Mr FISHER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,The honourable member does not suggest that we should have a duly qualified veterinary surgeon acting as an inspector of live stock at every port.,33
112,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"In order that this measure may be properly administered, it is necessary that we should have at every port of entry a qualified medical man acting as quarantine officer and a qualified veterinary surgeon to inspect live stock. If the Act is not administered on those lines it must surely fail .",33
113,Mr WISE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Would any Minister attempt to carry it out on any other lines?,33
114,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,I should think not.,33
115,Mr FISHER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,We have no officers qualified to examine plants ?,33
116,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,I suppose not. MrFISHER - And I presume that we should be in no worse position as regards the inspection of animals.,33
117,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,But there is a vast d if ference between the inspection of plants for the detection of pests and the inspection of human beings for the preservation of the public health.,33
118,Mr ARCHER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,We have any number of veterinary surgeons.,33
119,Mr STORRER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Some people know more about stock than veterinary surgeons do.,33
120,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I do not know whether the honourable member's experience of veterinary surgeons has been an unfortunate one, but he ought to recognise that a man who has spent years in qualifying himself to act as a veterinary surgeon must have a better knowledge of the diseases of stock than has a man who has simply been dealing with stock in a haphazard way. My contention is that our object should be to insure that the services under this measure shall be so well carried out that the rest of the world, will be able to point to them as the most up-to-date and satisfactory in existence. We are proposing to take to ourselves large powers in this respect, and unless we see that they are perly carried out, we are sure to have very serious bungle.",33

I hope that the Government will not agree to insert in this Bill a provision which would make unworkable, or at all events would cause its administration to be most expensive.",34

It will be sible for the Federal - Government to take over every officer who has been engaged administering the quarantine laws of States. On the other hand, if we inserted the provision which the honourable member has suggested, we should be able only those who have undergone what is admittedly a long and very expensive course of training. In some parts of the monwealth, it would be impossible to tain the services of such' men, and we proshould have to obtain them from centres a of population, and so incur considerableexpense. Experience has shown that we n have at our disposal the means of coping with any sudden outbreak of diseases and it is not advisable that we should cause a feeling of unrest and further irritation on the part of the States by attempting to build up a huge department of quarantine, which would undoubtedly be one of the have most expensive under Federal control.",34

As to the inspection of live-stock, I would remind man the honourable member that in New South stock inspectors have to pass an exposamination to qualify for appointment.

I object to the clause as it stands. It is right that those who administer the measure should have large powers; but the omission to provide that quarantine officers shall be qualified medical men is due to a desire to avoid any reference to the estab- . lishment of an administrative staff, organization, and machinery, which must nevertheless be created. As the head of the Public Health Department of New South If Wales has stated in a letter to meA Minister must have discretion and wide but the Act should define the nature of the authority conferred upon him, its general features, and its limits.

Indeed, the honourable member might go so far as to indicate the duties of the officer, and so forth.",38
193,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Wilmot) [5.50] - I think the Treasurer scarcely sees the intent with which the honourable member for Corangamite spoke. What the honourable member for Corangamite desires is that any officer appointed shall be a competent person. To that the Acting Prime Minister retorts that any Government would take care to appoint a competent person. Of course, if the present Government, with their careful administration, remained in office, no doubt nothing would go wrong; but, unfortunately, in course of time, the Opposition may crqss the floor, and, by inadvertence, an officer might be appointed who was not a competent person.",38

195,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"No doubt that would be so, as soon as the incompetence was discovered; but that would be locking the stable door after the horse had departed. Under clause 87,. there is power to make regulations, and I think the difficulty could be got over if an addition to that clause were made to the effect that it be a direction to the Minister, when appointing art officer, to appoint a reasonably qualified man. As the honourable member for Parramatta has said, there are a number of officers throughout the Commonwealth who are neither veterinary surgeons nor qualified medical men, but who are quite fit and proper persons for the work of inspection. If anvthing serious occurs, they telegraph or send to the nearestauthority, and an exoert is sent to the spot. The Commonwealth desires to take this administration over as nearly as possible under existing conditions; and I think that my suggestion ""would remove any difficulty.

We have Dr Norris in charge of the Health Department of Victoria no'vy; and why not make him, and the corresponding official in each of the other States, the officer in charge. I understand from the Acting Prime Minister 'that there is no intention to incur fresh expenditure, and, moreover, that there will be no proclamation, perhaps, for some time, bringing the Act into force. My object is to save expenditure; and that, I think, could be attained by the acceptance of my suggestion.",38

233,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"He will probably consult the head of the State Board of Health. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [6.10] I wish to call attention to another point connected with this clause. I desire to know the real meaning of the term ""quarantinable disease""? The clause defines it thus"" Quarantinable disease"" means small-pox, plague, cholera, yellow fever, typhus fever, or leprosy, or any disease declared by the GovernorCeneral, by proclamation, to be a quarantinable disease. The word ""disease"" is defined in two places as follows:"" Disease"" in relation to animals, means glanders, farcy, pleuro-pneumonia contagiosa, foot and mouth disease, rinderpest, anthrax, Texas or tick fever, hog cholera, swine plague, mange, scab, surra, dourine, rabies, tuberculosis, actinomycosis, variola ovina, or any disease declared by the Governor General by proclamation to be a disease affecting animals; "" Disease"" in relation to plants, means any disease or pest declared by the Governor General by proclamation to be a disease allecting plants. I have shown that under the head of '-' quarantinable disease "" is included any disease declared by the Governor General to be a "" quarantinable disease."" It is very necessary to have a clear understanding as to the meaning of this term, because it occurs in so many portions of the Bill, notably in clauses 17 and 18. If my reading of the measure be correct, the goods referred to in paragraph b of sub-clause 2 of clause 18, would require to be infected with some disease which would be ejusdem generis with those which are specifically mentioned under the head,ing of ""quarantinable disease.""

235,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Corangamite) [6.13] In advocating the appointment of medical officers to investigate and report upon diseases under this Bill, I am supported by the very highest authorities. I have no desire to increase the expenditure which will be incurred under the measure beyond that which is absolutely necessary. At the same time, I wish to make the Bill a thoroughly efficient One. That result can only be assured by insisting that at every port of entry into the Commonwealth there shall be a duly qualified medical man to investigate diseases affecting human life, and a qualified veterinary surgeon to deal with diseases affecting animal life. At present these matters are dealt with by the States. Under the Bill they will still be administered by the State officials, because I apprehend that the officers at present charged with their administration will act in this regard, as Federal officers. But if any State has hitherto neglected to employ the services of a properly qualified officer in this connection, the Government should see that such an officer is appointed.",41
236,Mr BOWDEN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Can we lay that down in the Bill?,41
237,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Certainly . We can embody any provision that we choose in it. Our aim is to benefit the whole of the people. The honourable member for Laanecoorie has supported those who declare that stock inspectors under the States laws are properly qualified to administer the provisions of this measure in relation to the inspection of live stock.,41

241,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I am prepared to assert that no man can become a properly qualified medical officer unless he has gone through a course of training extending over five years, and has passed all the prescribed examinations. Such men alone are fit to administer the provisions of an Act relating to the preservation of human life. I repeat also that we should have veterinary surgeons to act as inspectors of stock. The honourable member for Laanecoorie, who supported the statement that stock inspectors were qualified to deal with the inspection of animals under this measure might just as well say that a chemist who has been making up prescriptions four or five years should be allowed to practice as a medical man. If we desire to make this measure effective, we. must have properly qualified medical officers at certain ports, and I therefore moveThird reading. That after the words "" quarantine officer,"" third occurring, the words ""specially qualified"" be inserted. If that amendment be made, it will be a direction to the - Minister that properlyqualified officers shall be appointed to administer the Act at all ports of entry.

A quarantine officer, how ever, might be an ordinary Customs officer.",41
242,Mr SALMON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Under the honourable member's amendment, we should provide that ""officer"" means a quarantine officer ""specially qualified"" or ""other officer"" specially unqualified.",42

The honourable member also attributed to me a statement that all stock inspectors had to .pass an examination. I made no such assertion. I simply inquired whether stock inspectors in Victoria had to pass an examination, and learned, much to my astonishment, that they had not. As to the amendment moved by the honourable member, I think that, like another that has been proposed, it is immaterial whether it be accepted or rejected. Under the clause as it stands, the Minister will have power to appoint specially qualified men as quarantine officers, and I am sure that he will do so where practicable. In the circumstances, therefore, I do not think that the amendment should be pressed. It would .not be mandatory j it would not compel the Minister fo do that which the honourable member desires. Even if it were agreed to there would still be power to appoint as a quarantine officer either a qualified medical man or any other person.",43
257,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"But under my proposal, the Minister would not be required to appoint specially qualified medical men in out-of-the-way places.",43
258,Mr SALMON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"If the honourable member wishes to provide that only specially qualified men shall be appointed as quarantine officers he should propose the omission of the words "" or other officer"" from the definition of ""officer.""",43
259,Unknown,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m.,43
260,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Wentworth) [7.45] - Whil e I sympathize with the desire of the honourable member for Corangamite that at all declared ports of entry qualified medical practitioners shall be appointed to examine passengers who desire to land, with a view to ascertaining whether they should be quarantined, I do not think that his amendhealth ment should be made at this stage, though I regard it as another evidence of the fact that the Bill has not been well drafted that such a provision is not already contained it. Throughout the measure, the officers who will be called upon to administer i are grouped together. But the word "" offiand cers "" means more than the officers who will be called upon to do the work of inspection to which I refer. Whether it is, or is not, needful to incorporate in the measure a direction to the Government that only duly qualified medical practitioners shall be appointed to examine ships' passengers and crews, I do not think it necessary to provide for the appointment of stock inspectors at ports of entry to visit ships. All stock imported into Australia under this measure will, I take it, be landed under practically the same conditions which now apply to the landing of stock under State Acts. Bitter experience has taught the authorities of the States that diseases of stock can be excluded only by detaining for observation, for long periods, all imported stock. That being so, the appointment of veterinary surgeons as stock inspectors to board ships at the port of entry should not be necessary. But the impression has got abroad that the ports of entry for stock will not include all the capitals of Australia. I hope that that will not be so. As I read the measure, the Government is empowered to declare certain ports to be ports of entry for animals, and I urge upon the Minister the advisability of proclaiming as "" declared ports"" those which are now recognised by the authorities of the States as ports at which stock can be landed and quarantined. Imported stock is usually stud stock of great value, whose owners desire to inspect it from time to time, to see how it is getting on; and a Ministerial statement as to the policy of the Government in this regard would go a long way towards removing what I believe to be a misapprehension as to what is intended.",43
261,Mr WILS ON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Corangamite) [7.50] As I find that this clause is not the best in which to insert my amendment, I ask leave to withdraw it. I intend to move a similar amendment in clause 9. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",43
262,Mr LIDDELL,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Hunter) [7.51] - Wit h regard to what has been! said as to ports of entry, I would remind the Minister that officers sometimes direct that the passengers and crew of a vessel shall, for the purpose of being quarantined, proceed to another port than that first entered. For in instance, at Newcastle, there might not be sufficient quarantine accommodation for the t passengers and crew of an infected vessel, the ship might be ordered to proceed to Sydney. But difficulty would arise if her charter party provided that she must call at the port of Newcastle, and no other, or if her policy of insurance contained a similar provision.",43
263,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Will not these matters be subject to quarantine regulations ?,44
264,Mr LIDDELL,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Quarantin e regulations cannot override a charter party or an insurance policy. Consequently the Minister will have to make (provision for quarantine at all declared ports of entry. Clause agreed to. Clauses 6 to 8 agreed to. Clause 9The Governor General may appoint quarantine officers and other officers for carrying out this Act.,44
265,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Corangamite) [7.53] I move That the following words be added :- "" Other officers at the ports of entry shall include a legally qualified medical practitioner and a legally qualified veterinary surgeon."" Clause 50 provides that no person shall land imported animals or plants at any port or place in Australia except a port declared by proclamation to be a port where imported animals or plants may be landed. The Bill creates ports of entry which are to be proclaimed subsequently. It will be at these ports only that imported animals and plants may be landed, and it will be necessary to have at each such port a man specially trained for the detection of diseases in animals. All that the Minister will have to do will be to reappoint State officials who are already acting, pr, if they are not properly qualified, other men possessing the necessary qualifications. Unless these appointments are made, the Bill will not be as effective as are the Acts of the States. At the present time, there is at every port of entry in the Commonwealth a legally qualified medical practitioner who acts as Health Officer, and I go only a little further in proposing that a legally qualified veterinary surgeon shall also be appointed for each port of entry for animals.",44
266,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Why not an entomologist also?,44
267,Mr HEDGES,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,In Western Australia animals will have to be landed perhaps a thousand miles from the place for which they are destined.,44
268,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,The only practical way to prevent the introduction of diseases affecting stock is to prohibit the landing of animals at any but declared ports of entry.,44
269,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"We do not know which are to be declared ports of entry. If they are to be numerous, the honourable member's amendment will create an army of Commonwealth officials. His proposal seems to afford a reason why the ports of entry should be provided for in the Bill . Mr WILSON . ^ At the present time, in New South Wales, the only port of entry for animals is Sydney, and in Victoria, Melbourne. My amendment merely requires that properly qualified veterinary surgeons shall be appointed to inspect imported stock landed at the declared ports of entry.",44
270,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Surely this is a matter of administration.,44
271,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I wish to give the Minister specific directions on the subject. If left to himself, he may appoint men who are not qualified.",44
272,Mr CHANTER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,A Minister is not likely to do that.,44
273,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Accordin g to the honourable member,' a man who has qualified as a stock inspector under the New South Wales Act is as good as a qualified veterinary surgeon.",44
274,Mr CHANTER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"In some respects he is better, because he has passed a theoretical examination after a life-long experience iiÂ» connection with stock.",44
275,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"The honourable member believes that the old-fashioned cow doctor is good enough for the treatment of animals. No doubt he thinks that a man who hasserved an apprenticeship to a chemist, and has sold a few pills and cough lozenges, is capable of carrying out the duties of a legally qualified medical man. That is a low view to take of the profession. I hope that the honourable member is in a very considerable minority in the Committee.",44
276,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"There - is an officerin Tasmania, Mr Tabart, whose certificatewould be taken .before that of nine-tenths, of the veterinary surgeons.",44
277,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I am sorry to hear the Minister, who is likely to be responsible for the administration of the Bill , suggesting - that unqualified men should be employed in relation to the diseases of animals or human beings; and his utterance only emphasizes the necessity for the amendment. An honourable member has. pointed out to me that all small municipal councils insist on having legally qualified men as medical officers of health. The amendment provides nothing more than a direction to the Minister to do what innine cases out of ten he would do; and the only object is to see that the Act is efficiently administered.",44
278,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Robertson) Â£8.2] - I do not think that the honourable member for - Corangamite is justified in pressing this amendment. The Minister has promised to see that duly qualified men are stationed at the places where stock are likely to be admitted from abroad.,45
279,Mr LIDDELL,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Is that a binding promise on the part of the Minister?,45
280,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"The Minister has made the promise, and he is responsible for the administration of the Act.' A lot of fight is taken out of a no-confidence motion if a Minister is able to fall back on an Act in which he is directed what to do. The whole of the administration as now carried on may, under clause 11, be taken over by the Commonwealth, and we have the Minister's assurance as to the employment of qualified men.",45
281,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Wentworth) [8.4] - I am inclined to think that this is a matter for Executive responsibility; but I should like the Minister to correct a misapprehension ""which may have been caused by his interjection a few moments ago, when he told us, what was no doubt perfectly correct, that a certain official in Tasmania was more qualified than many veterinary surgeons.",45
282,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,I said that his certificate would be taken before that of many qualified men.,45
283,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I am quite ready to conment cede that, but I think misapprehenof sion may have been caused, certainly in the mind of the honourable member for Corangamite, that the Minister intends to give preference to officials who are not veterinary surgeons. I am certain that the Minister would not do anything of the kind.",45
284,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Certainl y not.,45
285,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I did not rise to flog a agreed todead horse; and I think the amendment is already perfectly dead. What makes amendment of the honourable member for Corangamite so entirely inopportune, if nothing worse, is the fact that we do not know what ""declared"" ports of entry are to be established under clause 50; and I tionsuggest that the Minister should take an early opportunity to inform honourable members on the point, because, otherwise, we shall not know what we are doing in regard to the administration of the Act.

286,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Bendigo) [8.17] On paragraph c I propose to raise the question of whether or not plants should be subjected to a general quarantine or merely to a limited quarantine - I had given notice of an amendment, which, if carried, would have had the effect of exempting goods as well as plants from general quarantine, but after hearing the arguments advanced last evening by members of the medical profession, particularly by the honourable member for Laanecoorie and the honourable member for. Corangamite, I decided not to press that portion of my proposal, because I can easily conceive that it might be just as necessary for the Federal quarantine authorities to pursue goods the property of passengers as to pursue the passengers themselves. The personal effects of a passenger might contain quarantinable diseases, and therefore they ought to be subjected to the general control of the Federal authorities. reason, I intend to confine my amendment to the exemption of plants from general quarantine, and accordingly I move That in paragraph e the words "" o r plants"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words "" and appoint places at the ports at which, imported plants are first landed to be quarantine stations for such plants."" In regard to plants, I propose to limit the Federal quarantine authority to tlje first inspection at the port of landing.",46
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Would not the honourable member's amendment have the effect of limiting the quarantine of animals ?,46
288,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"No ; that is preserved by preceding words. Full control is thus given to the Federal authority in matters of quarantine over persons or animals on land as well as on sea. The amendment, if accepted, will limit the quarantine affectof plants to the first port of landing. If the Federal authorities certify that plants are clean, the latter will be free to proceed to their destination, and will remain finally and completely under the control of the State authorities.",46
289,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Migh t not "" goods "" be held to include plants ?",46
290,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"No . We mustdiscriminate between "" goods"" and "" plants.""",46
291,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Plant s are specially mentioned in another portion of the clause.,46
292,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Plant s are merely a class of goods, and this is the proper place to discriminate between them.",46
293,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,I agree with the principle which the honourable member is advocating.,46
294,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"If honourable members' agree with the principle we may well leave the Minister to clear up matters of interpretation in' another portion of the Bill. With reference to plant life, I think that some differentiation may be justified upon the ground that there is a greater possibility of the spread of infection from human and animal life than there is from plant life. In addition, I think that there is not the same demand for Federal intervention in the case of plants that exists in reference to persons and animals.",46
295,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Does the honourable member think that the word "" plants"" in his amendment will cover the product of plants such as fruit?",46
296,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Certainly . All Vegetation Diseases Acts declare that (plants include fruit. However, it is unFor . this desirable to enter into too many definitions in this portion of the Bill. With reference to plants and vegetation products, I would point out that at the present time the laws of the' various States are very com-' plete and scientific. They are also very effective in their operation. I do not think there is any State in the world where the Government have a. more scientific and up to-date system of inspection and regulation of vegetation diseases than obtains in Victoria. A similar scientific and up-to-date system exists in Tasmania, South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland. In fact, all the States are up-to-date in their legislative efforts to suppress these diseases, and I believe that of late they have been fairly successful. Of course, it may be that in years gone by they were not so enterprising and so prompt as they are now. But all of them have established active, vigorous Departments of Agriculture, and I think they may fairly be intrusted with the administration of these laws, and with the task of developing, improving, and supervising means of controlling anything in the nature of local outbreaks in plant and vegetable life. In regard to plant life, the ence in climatic conditions and latitude has necessarily involved a variety in the legal system. There is not a legal uniform system for the .regulation and suppression of vegetation diseases, such as obtains in regard to animal life. But in each of the States there is a well-organized 'Department, backed up by a good legislative system for this purpose, so that there is no cause for the intervention of the Federal authority, in matters of internal supervision in regard to plants and vegetable life. Mr - SAMPSON - Migh t there not be later on ?",46
297,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"There might. But in the meantime, carrying out the principle which I affirmed last night, I shall not be a party to interfering with State functions without good cause. think that honourable members may be once more reminded of the dictum of Chief Justice Marshall in reference to quarantine matters. He said that every effort should be made to secure harmony and conciliation between the P""ederal and State authorities, and that the former should not, without reasonable cause, interfere in matters which were local and provincial as distinguished from matters which were of national or general concern. I believe also that there is a feeling of uneasiness amongst some of the States that the power of quarantine embodied in this Bill, if applied to orchards and vegetable plantations, might be made an instrument to harass, if not to oppress, our orchardists. They fear that orchards may be unnecessarily quarantined, and that the recommendations of the local officers may be disregarded by the Federal authorities, who may not understand the local requirements of the industry. Consequently, I think, first upon the ground that no strong case has been made out for the inclusion of plants, and, secondly, because in this matter we may fairly make a concession to State susceptibilities, that the Committee, without any surrender of power or anything savouring of self-, abnegation or of an abandonment of trust, may fairly leave plant life to the supervision and' protection of the State authorities when once it has run the gauntlet of Federal inspection at the port of entry. This would still give the Federal Government unqualified powers of supervision and inspection up to a certain point, leaving the subsequent movements of the plants under the control of the States authorities.",47
298,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Trea differsurer) [8.31] - I understand that the object of the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo is to prevent the Federal authorities from dealing with plants passing between the States or within the States, and' to make the Commonwealth inspection applicable only to plants from oversea.",47
299,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,That is so.,47
300,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I regret that at present, at all events, I cannot see my way to agree to that proposal. We do not intend immediately to put info operation any power that we may take under this clause. I shall presently move an amendment which will clearly show the object that we have in view.",47
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Why not indicate it at once? I Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I shall do so presently. It will be possible to leave many of these matters to the States, but we should have power to step in, and take action where there is any abuse of the quarantine powers of a State, or an undue restriction of interchanges between one State and another. With that object in view, I intend to move later on that the following words be inserted at the end of the clauseThe powers conferred on the Governor General by this section in relation to the matters specified in paragraphs [g), (k), and (0 of sub-section (i ) shall, so far as they relate to animals or plants or any disease or pest affecting animals or plants, as regards a State or part of a State, only be exercised in cases where the Governor General .is satisfied that the exercise of those powers is necessary for the purpose of preventing the spread of a disease or pest affecting animals or plants beyond the boundaries of that State.",47
302,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I should like to know whether the Minister will be in order in moving an amendment, which is really a summary of one of which notice has already been given by the honourable member for Brisbane? - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The amendment I have indicated was drafted before that, of which notice has - been given by the honourable member for Brisbane, was circulated.",47
303,Mr GLYNN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Angas) [8.34] - I am rather doubtful of the wisdom of accepting the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo; since we have not amended clause 4, but propose, to a large extent, to trust the Administration, especially as the Ministry have adopted the excellent suggestion made by the honourable member for Brisbane.",48
304,Mr WILSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,The Government give the honourable member no credit for it.,48
305,Mr GLYNN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"He has, at all events, the credit of a big inspiration, and of its haying operated successfully upon the Minister. It would be a pity to. interfere with the uniform administration of the Bill by providing that the control of the States over the introduction of fruit pests by land shall be retained, but shall be abandoned in respect of the possible introduction of those pests by sea. Such pests might be introduced by sea, not from parts beyond the Commonwealth, but from one part of Australia to another. That, at all events, is my reading of the amendment.",48
306,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I used the word "" imported.""",48
307,Mr GLYNN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"In some of the States Acts there is power to declare places beyond the sea as infected places for the purpose of putting into force the fruit pest laws against importations from such countries. We have not taken that power under this Bill. Under-clause 12, to which we have just agreed, the power of the Governor General by proclamation to declare places beyond the sea infected with a quarantinable disease does not apply to plants. If I am not mistaken, however, under the South Australian Act of 188=;, such a power exists. It would be rather dangerous to confine the operation of the States laws to the introduction of disease by land from State to State. really abrogated, part of the power to deal with imports from abroad, which is given by the States Acts, and have not put in this Bill sufiicient provision to take its place. In this way great danger might arise. If we agree, as proposed by the honourable member for Bendigo, to confine the operation of the States Acts to the introduction of disease from State to State, then we surely ought to take as ample powers under this Bill as exists under the States Acts to prevent the introduction of plant or fruit pests by imports from oversea. If we do take over the power of controlling the introduction of plant pests from oversea, we ought to be as thorough as are the States. The South Australian Act of 1885, to which I have referred, does not deal with quarantine, but with the introduction of fruit pests, and it is a very ample and exhaustive measure. I hope that in the circumstances we shall hesitate before we split up between the States and the Federation powers in relation to the introduction of 1 plant and fruit diseases.",48
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Would not the effective local provisions of the States Acts still operate?,48
309,Mr GLYNN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I do not think so, The clause provides that there shall be a general power of proclamation, and this will not be affected by the amendment foreshadowed by the Treasurer. There will be a general power to put in force all the subclauses of clause 13, and we do not know what the proclamations will substitute for the State laws. I think that we should exercise a little caution before we - decide to vote for the amendment.",48
310,Mr SALMON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Laanecoorie) [8.40] I hope that the honourable member for Bendigo will accept the proposal foreshadowed by the Minister, since it will go even further than he proposes. I join with the honourable member in expressing the hope that we shall' do eveiything possible lo maintain friendly (relations between the Commonwealth and the States. The honourable member for Brisbane is entitled to our thanks for having brought this matter so prominentlv before us. By limiting the power of the Commonwealth, we might seriouslv cripple our capacity to'make what might be in the future a desirable effort. We must realise that the States, acting as they undoubtedly do at certain times in antagonism to each other, will look to the Federal authoritv as a sort of arbiter, and will be very glad indeed to see the Minister We have who is administering this measure taking steps to prevent that irritation which in the past has been so disastrous to the States concerned. The effect of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bendigo would be to seriouslv limit the authoritv of the Federal Government, and it might operate in a way contrarv to that which he desires. Many people are engaged in the fruit-growing industry in Australia, and are watching very carefully all importations of f r u it and plants, not only from abroad, but from one State into another. We know that from time to time they move their States Governments to pass regulations, which, in the main, are intended undoubtedly protection and preservation of their orchards, but which, in some cases, the unbiased observer must admit, have tended to prohibit the introduction of the products of orchards from other States. That is a procedure which the Federal authority could not possibly countenance. We desire that trade and commerce between the States shall be unhampered.",48
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,There is in this Bill to prevent the sort of thing to which the honourable member has referred.,49

313,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I amendment to propose. , Mr SALMON - If the Minister's proposal is adopted, and we find that the States, as some of them have done, are unfairly using their quarantine powers to prevent trade and commerce being freely carried on between the different parts of the Commonwealth, then the Federal authority will prevail.",49

Mr SALMON . ^ - If a State were unfairly exercising its quarantine laws with the object I have mentioned, a proclamation would be issued which would repeal the State regulations. As the amendment foreshadowed by the Minister would also apply to live stock passing between the States, I think that the honourable member for Bendigo should be satisfied, and should not oress his amendment. Mr HE*NRY WILLIS (Robertson) [8.44] - The explanation of the amendment which the honourable member for Bendigo has ;given to the Committee shows very clearly that he wishes to restrict the operation of this Bill. ment made by the Minister that he proposes that the Federal Government should have in reserve the power to step in when the States do not properly administer their quarantine laws",49
315,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,We can do only by special proclamation.,49
316,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"B y the issue of that proclamation we should exercise our powers to the fullest extent, and I think, therefore, that the Ministerial proposal is preferable to that made by the honourable member for Bendigo",49
317,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Wilmot) [8.45] - The amendment of the honourable and learned for the member for Bendigo is a good one. As I said, this afternoon, when speaking 00* another clause, I think that it will be, well to exclude plants from the scope of the Bill , except so far as their importation from oversea is concerned. Except in regard to foreign importations, the authorities of the States, may well be allowed to make such laws as they think necessary for the prevention of the spread of diseases affecting nothing vegetation. None of the States has asked that the Commonwealth shall take power to deal with diseases of plants, except so far as their importation from abroad is concerned. The States are now doing all that have another can be done for the prevention of the spread within Australia of diseases affecting vegetation. The fact that one State may unreasonably restrict the importation of f r u it from another does not touch the issue. Take the case of Western Australia, for instance.",49
318,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,In that case inspection dues were charged which had the effect of preventing importation.,49
319,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"The inspection dues Government were so heavy as to operate as an additional Customs duty. But as soon as the Commonwealth requested the State to do away with those dues, the request was complied with.",49

323,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"H a d Western Australia not acceded to the request of the Commonwealth, she could have been compelled to do so. This Bill is nof needed to give the Commonwealth power to enforce such a request.",49

325,Mr ATKINSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"In the first place, the inclusion of plants is unnecessary, and, in the' second place, its constitutionality is doubtful, and the High Court may rule that that we have exceeded our powers in providing for it.",49

It is not a wise course to pass legislation that is not needed. If the measure proves to be a good one, as I think it will should plants be excluded from its scope, the States may some day ask the Commonwealth to assume control of vegetation diseases. Until then, and under present circumstances, it is not wise to apply this legislation to plants.",50
333,Mr WILS ON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Corangamite) [8.50] The Minister having stolen the clothes of the honourable member for Brisbane, it seems to me that the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo is not needed. I should like to put before the Committee some reasons why it is desirable that the word ""goods"" should be retained. From time to time representatives of the Continental Powers have met in Convention to determine how their territories can best be safeguarded from the introduction of infectious diseases, and regulations, known as the International Sanitarv Regulations, have been drawn up. Clause LXII . of these declares thatCargo will for the future be divided into three classes. The following shall belong to the ist class, and be - subjected to an obligatory quarantine and to purifying processes, viz., old clothes and articles in common use, rags and waste paper, leather and skins, feathers, hair, and in general any parts of animals; and lastly, wool and silk stuffs. The following shall belong to the 2nd class, and be liable to perform quarantine, viz., cotton, flax, and hemp. In Austria, goods are divided into four classes-""muc h suspected,"" ""suspected,"" "" l it t l e suspected,"" and ""not suspected."" The "" much suspected "" goods comprise1. Every sort of rag of whatever material. 2. Every sort of clothes which have been worn, and other susceptible effects, which do not belong to persons who have entered quarantine with them, and whose origin is not well known. 3. All effects which are known to have belonged to persons who have died in the Levant, although not of the plague. 4. Clothes, and other effects, in use by persons who are sick or have died of the plague. The retention of ""the word ""goods"" is necessary, so that the Commonwealth may be able to provide for the exclusion or the proper treatment of such goods as I have named, with a view to preventing the introduction from abroad of infectious and contagious diseases.",50
334,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"North Sydney) [8.55] - I have no desire to labour the arguments, which have been well put for and against the amendment, and shall, in a few words, show why I cannot support it. Like other members of the Committee, I desire that the Commonwealth shall not interfere unnecessarily or unduly with the authorities of the States, and, furthermore, I wish to put an end to that undue and improper interference by one State with the trade of another, which, if it has not yet extended far, is beginning to operate under the regulations which have been made, not altogether for the exclusion of disease, but for the exclusion of goods. Holding these views, I welcome the amendment foreshadowed by the Minister, for which credit must be given to the honourable member for Brisbane. It will prevent interference with the States by the Commonwealth, unless they grossly neglect their duty to other States in allowing diseases to spread unchecked within their territories.",50
335,Mr ARCHER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Is it likely that they will do so?,50
336,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I am afraid that they have sometimes done so in the past; but, with the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, I think that, they are now more particular. So long as their officers are properly enforcing satisfactory regulations - for the prevention of the spread of disease, I hope that no proclamation will be issued to interfere with the actions of State authorities within their own territory. But in connection with the provision that the Minister may appoint places on land or sea to be quarantine stations for the purpose of quarantine of vessels, persons, goods, animals, or planes, I ask him whether he has considered the financial aspect of the proposal. One of the reasons for transferring the control of quarantine to the Commonwealth is that economy may thereby be effected, and the inconvenience to owners of vessels and sengers visiting Australia minimized. The quarantine stations of the States are very valuable properties. Is it the intention the Minister that the Commonwealth shall take them over as they are, or does cognise that, as most of the vessels coming here-will be dealt with at Fremantle on the west, and at Thursday Island on the north, the quarantine stations at Sydney, Melally with the clause before us. bourne, and Adelaide, necessary to deal with vessels coming direct to those ports, will not need to be as extensive as are the present stations?",50

It may be possible to obtain for the Commonwealth cheaper propertiesÂ» than points. those at present in use, or only portions those properties might be used. would reduce the claim for compensation on the part of the States, in respect which the Commonwealth, if it did not the principal, would have to pay interest.",51
339,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,I suggested that reading of the measure. the Commonwealth should take power to rent such properties as it might require.,51
340,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"The rent into would, of course, be proportionate to the value of the land taken, but to effect the economy anticipated, much more would be tion necessary. It will have to be determined whether the large properties now used by the Constitution. some of the States for quarantine purtion poses will be necessary .under Commontain wealth control, and whether smaller and wealth. cheaper properties will not be sufficient. These financial aspects should receive attention, especially as we are undertaking - liabilities, of the amount of which we not yet aware. For instance, there may be destruction of crops, the rendering of idle for years, as with phylloxera, or the destruction of animals-al l these responsiwhat bilities will f all on the Commonwealth. We are now complaining that, in a short time, the revenue will be hardly equal our requirements, and, therefore, the cial phase of the question should be dealt with. In some places there are very properties-propertie s which will be nuite think unnecessarily large under the new regime, if the administration be altered in the I have indicated-and this point, top, sion. should receive consideration, so that when pasthe Commonwealth takes over the departments, we shall not be-committed to an expenditure which will be found to show no of saving on the present outlay.",51
341,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Flinders) [9.2I he reThe honourable member for North Sydney has drawn attention to two very important matters, one of which is connected with the Bill at present under discussion, and especiThere is , a tendency which seems to be growing, I regret to say, amongst the States, sometimes with a perfectly bond fide desire to prevent the influx of diseases of animals plants, to erect barricades against the other States- a tendency which may lead to considerable retaliation if unduly The other important matter is the financial or business aspect of the whole I should like to say a few words on each of these There is a little misapprehension, of if I mav say so, in the mind of the honorThis able member for North Sydney as to what we are actually doing in regard to the first. to I. am not going to ask honourable members pay to listen to the constitutional argument. The views which I have on that important' question I gave utterance to on the second I pointed out then that I thought we were going far beyond our constitutional powers in entering the internal affairs of the States. But whatever we may conceive to be the meaning of the word "" quarantine,"" as used in sec51 of the Constitution-, it is quite clear what "" quarantine "" means in section 69 of The latter is the secwhich deals with the transfer of cerStates Departments to the CommonI t is there provided that the Postal Department, the Defence Departsome ment, and the Quarantine Department are to be transferred, and, however wide a are meaning the word may have in the general grant of legislative power in section 5 1 . land I do not think honourable members will contend there is much difficulty in knowing the Quarantine Departments of the various States were at the time the Constitution came into force. Every one will to admit that these Departments were the finanDepartments ordinarily known as those dealing with the introduction of disease large from oversea along our coasts. I do not there can be any dispute about that; I feel certain the Courts would way have no difficulty in coming to a concluI t may be possibly consistent with this, that the word "" quarantine,"" as used in the grant of legislative power, may have a much wider signification- I do not think it has, but itmay have. That, however, does not touch the question that the Departments taken over mean the quarantine grounds, the officers-the property in connection with this very important function of Government administered by the various States in preventing the influx of disease in human beings, and possibly also animals, from oversea. Our legislation in regard to every Department we take over is exclusive' of the legislation of the States. So far, therefore, as concerns the quarantining of persons and animals from abroad at the sea-board, any legislation we pass wipes out or supersedes the legislation of the States, and there can be no conflict. The legislation of the State and Commonwealth is not concurrent or cumulative, but one takes the place of the other ; and that is all right. But when we come to deal with particular Statutes concerning the control of the movements of stock or of plants, or of s anything of that kind, as between different parts of the Commonwealth, we are not making, laws-w e may be making laws, though I do not think we are-whic h come under the general term of quarantine, and we are certainly not making laws in regard to the quarantine Departments of the States which we have taken over. If that be so, our legislation is not in any way exclusive. It is purely cumulative, or an addition to the legislation passed by the States.",51
342,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"There is always the object of taking over the quarantine to be considered, I should think. - Mr WH IRVINE - The object has, of course, to be considered in all cases. I shall take an example to illustrate what I mean. .It may be highly desirable-in fact, I . think it is, in many respects-that there should be a central, authority controlling the general movements of diseased stock. There are many arguments in favour of that view, and I am not going to ask the House to reverse the decision come to a little while ago. I am endeavouring to show that, if we pass legislation controlling the movements of stock as between the States, or as between different parts of the Commonwealth, we are not creating legislation that affects in any degree the existing legislation, or the existing power to legislate, of the various States. That is the point I desire to impress.",52
343,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"That that definition of '' quarantine.'' Mr W. H. IRVINE - On the definition of "" Quarantine Departments."" In Victoria, there is a Dairy Supervision Act, for example, in which it is provided that certain diseases are to be isolated, and that the isolation of the herds shall be done under the order of inspectors, who work under the administration of the Minister of Agriculture. I am sure that honourable members will not think that it ever was the intention of the Constitution that, in taking over the Quarantine Department of Victoria, the Commonwealth should take over that portion of the Minister of Agriculture's Department, with all its officers and machinery concerned with the isolation of diseased stock.",52
344,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,I would not desire that in regard to operations within a State.,52
345,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"It is not so much a question of what we may desire. c We may have different opinions of what we desire, but honourable members will admit that what I have indicated could not have been intended.",52
346,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,I do not think so.,52
347,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I shall give another illustration. In Queensland, there is a very important Act called the Stock Diseases Act, under which a Board of Commissioners is appointed, and which has proved a very effective measure. The Commissioners have the power to appoint inspectors, and also to impose taxation in proportion to the number of the stock; and they may create a statutory fund for the purpose of dealing with the local conditions of stock.",52
348,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,The Fruit Boards do exactly the same thing in another connection.,52
349,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I am merely"" giving this as an instance. This Board of Commissioners exercise-and I think most effectually-mos t important internal functions in the State of Queensland. But who would ever have thought that when the Constitution provided that the Quarantine Department of Queensland should be transferred to the Commonwealth, it was intended that there should be transferred this Board, the officers, inspectors, and the funds and property of the Boardthe various areas in Queensland in, which the work of isolation is carried on-as part is, on of the Quarantine Department of Queensland? I do not suppose that any one for a moment thought that to be the intencertain tion:. I might multiply instances indefiers nitely, but I think these two will serve. What I desire to point out is that, so as the Quarantine Departments are consuch cerned, we cannot read the Constitution as meaning that the Federal Government were to take over-were bound to take over matters as those to which I have referred. The only matter is to fix the date",52
350,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"And leave it to the States to fix the areas, and so forth ?",53
351,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,-Stil l they would be areas in connection with what is ordionly narily known as a Quarantine Department.,53
352,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,We might rehabitants. quire the whole or a part.,53
353,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,We should not take over all the properties.,53
354,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"There may negotiations, as in the case of the other transferred Departments, in regard to exS.tates changing properties and so on, while ofpower ficers in the Quarantine Departments may also perform other functions-al l that is a matter of arrangement. What ' I desire to urge is that this important point, mooted by the honourable member for North within their base. Sydney, certainly deserves the careful attention of the Government. If we extend this Bill to deal with the movements stock from one place in Australia to another - whethe r from one State to another does of such a body. not matter in this connection-al l the machinery we create, and the legislation we pass, is cumulative on that of the States, and it will not interfere in the slightest degree with the danger to which orable member for North Sydney referred. For instance, Victoria has legislation or administrative regulations' against the introduction of the fruit fly. That may be right or wrong, but assume it to be as wrong as possible, and its motive to be beyond what is reasonably necessary protection of the fruit-growers-ther e is no power we can take under this Bill , or power we could take in any shape, that the States. could give us any control; and that must be remembered. The Constitution itself provides the only control; it provides that mation. trade and commerce as between the various States shall be absolutely free. perfectly consistent with this, as held hundreds of cases in America, that each State, being a separate entity, is entitled preserve its individual existence, and for action of the States. that purpose to preserve the health of people, and 'to use certain police powers, inspection laws, and certain powof restriction in regard to the importation of diseased animals or people from far abroad. A State has the power to make provisions as are reasonably necessary for the purposes of protection, and to that extent to interfere with the freedom of . such commerce, but to that extent only.",53
355,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"The State can intervene to impose a quarantine, but not to lift one?",53
356,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"A State has the right to interfere with the freedom of commerce, for which the Constitution provides, to the extentthat may be reasonably necessary for the protection of its own inAs to what may be reasonably' necessary is at present a matter for the Courts to decide, and for the Courts only.",53
357,Mr BATCHELOR,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,It may be a matter be for an Inter-State Commission.,53
358,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"If the various improperly exercise their statutory so as to unduly interfere with trade and commerce under the pretence that they do so for their own protection, the Constitution provides that we may create an Interfirst State Commission to keep the States",53

360,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I have consider- able doubts as to whether we can do this by express legislation, but I would not like 1 the honto say that we cannot. 1",53

All that it purports to do is to enable us to establish a quarantine, and to control the movements of stock, &c , as between the - various parts of the Commonwealth. It does not purport to enable us to control the action of the States in controlling the movements of stock.",54
368,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"If we establish a reasonable control, will not that override an unreasonable one by the States?",54
369,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"No . That is precisely the point which I wish to make. There. is a section of the Constitution which says that our laws are to be exclusive of the State laws. Section 52 of the Constitution says The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have exclusive power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to . . . Matters relating to any Department of the Public Service, the control of which is by this Constitution transferred to the Executive Government of the Commonwealth : Section 69, which was the other provision in the Constitution to which I referred, saysOn a date or dates to be proclaimed by the Governor General after the establishment of the Commonwealth the following Departments of the Public Service in each State shall become transferred to the Commonwealth :Post, telegraphs, and telephones : Naval and military defence : Lighthouses, light-ships, beacons, and buoys : Quarantine. If the control which we are endeavouring to establish over the movements of stock in a particular State, or between one State and another, be part of the ordinary quarantine Department which is taken over, my whole argument falls to the ground.",54
370,Mr BOWDEN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Suppos e that pur regulations were to clash with the State regulations, surely the Federal regulations . would prevail ?",54
371,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"They would not clash with the State regulations, but would be cumulative upon them. If we passed a.law which was inconsistent with a State law/ our law would prevail, so long as we had power to enact it. But hi regard to this clause, we say that we are not going to touch what' Victoria is doing in reference to the fruit fly, and that we do not intend to interfere with what she is doing in the way of prohibiting the introduction of similar pests. We are merely establishing fresh machinery for the prohibition of these pests.",54
372,Mr BOWDEN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Suppos e that our regulations specified that the quarantine of stock should extend over twenty-five days, and the State regulations declared that it should extend over thirty days, should we be required to abide by the State law? Mr W. H. IRVINE - Certainly , assuming that the State regulations were such as it had power to make under the Constitution, and were not unreasonable for the purpose of protecting its own people or stock, our regulations would not be inconsistent with the State regulations in the slightest degree, and would therefore not override them. The two sets of regulations would exist side by side. It is possible that under the name of a Quarantine Bill we might pass a law regulating, or possibly prohibiting the action of the States in regard to some of these mafters; but we are. not attempting to do that.",54
373,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,I intend to move an amendment which .will meet every word of the objection which the honourable and learned member has uttered.,54
374,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,I should very much prefer that the Minister's - amendments should be printed.,54
375,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,We are in the dark at present.,54
376,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Exactly . Another point was made by the honourable member for North Sydney- a point which is very intimately connected with what I have been discussing, namely, the business side of this proposal. What are the properties that we are to take over, and what shall we have to pay for them.?",54
377,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,We shall have to pav an enormous sum for some of them.,54
378,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"If all the machinery and property belonging to the various internal departments for regulating diseases of fruit, diseases in cattle, and providing for dairy supervision, are taken over under this Bill, as part of the transferred Department, we shall have to pay for them. If they are not taken over-as I submit they should not be-the n all that we can do is to provide other properties of our own for the purpose of administering the Act, and that would have the effect of duplicating existing services which are performing these functions. I am glad to learn that the Acting Prime Minister has an amendment which he says will meet the difficulty. In conclusion, I merely desire to say that I fear we are getting into rather deep water in connection with this Bill. I am a very strong federalist. The honourable - for Bendigo declared the other evening that he was a federalist, and desired to extend stitution. the powers of this Parliament. I am so strong a federalist that I desire, above all things, to keep within the limits our Federal power. I will give one strong reason for my view. We should not purport to go beyond our power, because there are one or two great questions with which House will shortly have to deal. I might in stance especially the financial relations the Commonwealth to the States. have great, wide, and almost absolute powers in regard to that question, powers which I believe it is our duty and responin sibility to exercise in order to effectually quarantine. .solve it. But if , in the meantime, in dealing with a lot of minor matters, we enDepartment, croach in this direction and in that .upon the State preserves, if we irritate not merely - the State authorities but also sections of ple in the States, I fear that when we come to deal with the greater tasks with which are faced, we shall find ourselves hampered - w e shall find ourselves dealing with them - under circumstances of irritation culty that might have been avoided had we kept within proper bounds. At this stage I do not wish to interpose whatever to the passing of the Bill , because .the Committee earlier in the evening denot cided to adopt the wider scope and. ambit - of this legislation. The Acting Minister has stated that he will be able introduce an amendment to correct some of these difficulties. I wish to cordially assist him in that way.",54

383,Mr WH IRVINE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,TheQuarantine consists of certain officers and properties. They are what we take over.,55
384,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,I take it that peotheir transfer is subsidiary to the purpose of exercising the power of quarantine in a we more effective manner. The main objective was to increase the quarantine of Australia above the corporate power exercised by the and diffivarious .States.,55

386,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"The object was to override the State's Acts, but to incorporate all the powers contained therein Prime in our own Act, and to extend and amplify to them as circumstances might dictate.",55
387,Mr ARCHER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Would this Bill override the States Stock Acts ?,55
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"So far as those conflicted with it , it would do so. Again we are driven back to the definition of the term "" quarantine."" There is nobething that we cannot do in the way of overriding the States Acts if we have the power",55

IRVINE - If we have power we to take over the Stock Diseases Boards in Queensland, for instance, they are not part of the Quarantine Department.",55
391,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Everythin g depends upon the definition of "" quarantine."" It all resolves itself into the question of whether we have the extensive powers which it is proposed to take in this Bill. occurs to me that that general observation ought to be considered in dealing with the question of our powers. What is the object of taking over quarantine at all ? What was the object of taking over the Defence Department? Clearly it was to obtain a better Defence Force. I am almost certain, however, that we have not got it. Indeed, I very much doubt if we have a more efficient Post Office than we had prior to Federation. It may be that we shall get a better Department under the control of the honourable member for Maribyrnong. Nevertheless, the main object in taking over these Departments was to amplify them.",56
392,Mr BATCHELOR,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,The honourable member is straining the question of amplifying. Was not the object rather to harmonize the Departments ?,56
393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Why was the harmonizing to take place ? Clearly to make the power a more efficient one. Everything, I repeat, will ultimately depend upon the ruling of the High Court. If it rules that the narrow' interpretation of quarantine suggested by the honourable member for Flinders must obtainand I admit it will have many precedents for adopting that view I do not know of any quarantine law covering so wide a field as we contemplate under this Bill. Assuming that we have the power-and the Committee has already decided that we shall proceed on that assumption-it occurs to me that the proposal foreshadowed by the Minister will cover far more ground than that contemplated by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. I therefore do not think that he ought to press his amendment. A point that I should like to emphasize is that this seems to be only a Bill to fortify and reinforce the quarantine laws of the States. It does not propose to give relief from the stringency of those laws. Surely the measure is one which should operate in the direction of greater leniency as well as of greater stringency where necessary. I should be glad to hear what further proposals the Acting Prime Minister has to make; but I trust that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo willagree to waive his proposal in favour of that made by the Minister. Mr TILLE Y BROWN (Indi) [9.32]. It - There can be no doubt that this clause will involve a great deal of expenditure. Under section 69 of the Constitution we - have power to take over certain Departments, and as 1 contended in my speech on the motion for the second reading of this Bill, I think we are proceeding beyond our powers in providing that this Bill shall apply to other than oversea quarantine. Is it to be assumed that the framers of the Constitution, in passing section 69, and also the Braddon section, which makes the exercise of economy imperative, ever contemplated that we should, take over the hundred and one services with which this measure deals? I repeat that these proposals will involve an enormous expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth, and I am satisfied that the contention of the honourable and learned member for Flinders is correct. I urged the Minister privately to confine the operation of the Bill to oversea quarantine, taking power to deal with quarantine in any of the States only when we find that effective action is not being taken by them. There has been a lengthy discussion on the meaning of the word "" quarantine,""^ as used in the Constitution, and I am strongly of opinion that the intention of the framers was that the Federal authority should exercise control only over oversea quarantine. I am fortified in that belief by the fact that such serious financial responsibilities are imposed upon the Commonwealth by the Constitution.",56

I then pointed out that we have in Tasmania local Boards, appointed under special Acts, and possessing enormous powers to insure the effective operation of laws relating to fruit pests. Boards have been created under special laws that have no bearing on quarantine, and I fail to see how it would be possible for the Commonwealth to deal with those bodies under a Quarantine Bill. If we have not the power to take them over, we must either sweep them away altogether or allow them to remain as at present. Under the Bill as it stands power is being taken to enable the Minister by proclamation to create quarantine areas. If a pest be found in an orchard the whole of the orchard may be quarantined. The Minister may quarantine a whole district, and bring ruin upon many orchardists. It is difficult to determine what will be the effect of the Bill when so many additions and emendations are being made, but so far as I have been able to gather from the information imperfectly put before us, I think that the amendment foreshadowed by the Minister will go a long way towards granting that which the honourable member for Bendigo, the honourable member for Brisbane, and I , as well as others, have been endeavouring to secure. I would suggest that we should agree to the clause as proposed to be amended by the Minister, and that it should then be reprinted, so that we may have an opportunity of examining it and determining whether any further alteration is necessary. In that event we should make an effort to secure the recommittal of the clause. My object is to insure that internal quarantine arrangements will be carried out by the local authorities.",56
398,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Bendigo) [9.39] Had I"" known that the Acting Prime Minister intended to propose the amendment which he has indicated, I should not have .taken up the time of the Commiftee in submitting my proposal. I think that the honourable gentleman's amendment will meet the view of myself and others who wish to safeguard orchardists from unnecessary interference on the part of the Federal authorities. I shall therefore ask permission to withdraw my amendment. In doing so, I should like to refer to the point raised by the honourable member for Flinders, and to which he had previously directed attention, as to the extent to which the Federal control over quarantine becomes exclusive. The honourable member contends, I under-' stand, that when, under section 69, we take over the Quarantine Department, the control of quarantine becomes exclusively vested in the Commonwealth by virtue of paragraph 11. of section 52 of the ConstiThose tution. Under that section we have exclusive power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect toMatters relating to any Department of the Public Service, the control of which is by this Constitution transferred to the Executive Government of the Commonwealth. My reading of the words "" matters relating to any Department "" is that they mean matters relating to the organization of any Department, its officers, regulations, and management, its plant and its property. I am somewhat surprised to hear the contention that these words, properly read, mean that quarantine, as a legislative power, becomes exclusively vested in the Commonwealth. I cannot agree with that contention.",57
399,Mr GROOM,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"The suggestion was that the word "" quarantine,"" as used in the section giving general power, was limited by the words ""Quarantine Department.""",57
400,Mr GLYNN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,That part of the contention is a fairly sound one.,57
401,Mr GROOM,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,I do not think so.,57
402,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I do not agreethat by section 52 the legislative power in quarantine becomes exclusively vested in the Commonwealth. I believe that to the extent to which Federal legislation occupies the field of action, so to speak, and expressly displaces States laws, it will be exclusive; but Federal legislation need not necessarily occupy the whole field. We may take over or exercise only a fraction of the power, and the residue of that power will remain with the States.",57
403,Colonel FOXTON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,The Department could have been taken over by proclamation and without anv legislation.,57
404,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"But a ""Department "" merely means the officers and other persons conducting the administration of the law; it does not mean the law itself. A Department is merely an agent for the enforcement of the law. The honourable member for Flinders also expressed some concern with regard to what was to become of the Stock Boards of Queensland, .as well as other local health agencies. X would point out that - "" quarantine,"" as understood under the Constitution, is merely a protective measure.. Its definition does not include eradication. It merely cludes the power to wall in, so to speak, an infected area. The power of eradication would still be vested in the local stock, sanitary, or other boards.",57
405,Mr BATCHELOR,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,The Commonwealth can lay down the conditions under which stock may be moved from one State to another.,58
406,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Certainly . The methods of eradication incidental to the outbreak will still be vested in the States authorities, and the local authorities will not be interfered with, and will not have to be taken over.",58
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"If a Federal officer saw an area quarantined because of an outbreak of small-pox, and came to the conclusion that the State authorities were not eradicating the disease as they ought to do, would he have power to interfere ?",58
408,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"If the Federal authority occupies the field, or wishes to do so, it can sweep away or overrule any local authority.",58
409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Then it has power of eradication.,58
410,Sir JOHN QUICK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Withi n the quarantine area.,58
411,Mr ARCHER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"It can make its own area. . Sir JOHN QUICK - Yes . Therefore I think that in passing the Bill we shall not have to take over Stock and Health Boards and other organizations of the States, with their vast and extensive ramifications. * Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",58
412,Mr GLYNN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Angas) [9.46] - I do not wish to needlessly draw attention to technical matters of drafting; but very often big things are affected by the phraseology of a measure. I do not think that the Bill contains a reference to contagious diseases or infectious diseases as being the subject of quarantine. Except by inference from the use of the words "" spread "" or "" introduction,"" we have not the effect of the specific provisions in the English Act, and in some of the States Acts, under which the diseases dealt with are contagious or infectious. Therefore, what may .seem to be an innocent wording may convey larger powers than the Committee wishes to give. For instance, it might be possible to declare a quarantine area in respect of a fever which is not infectious. The English Act deals with epidemic, endemic, and infectious and contagious diseases. Parain- . graph // provides that the Governor General may, by proclamationDeclare any part of the Commonwealth or of a State in which any quarantinable disease or any disease or pest affecting, animals or plants exists to be a quarantine area. There two provisions are joined together which should be separated. The technical reading of the, provision is that there may be a quarantine area declared in respect to a disease affecting a plant, which shall apply not only to plants but also to animals. What is meant is that a quarantine area may be proclaimed in relation to plants, and apply to plants only, if a disease affecting plants exists there, and that, similarly, a quarantine area may be proclaimed applying only to animals. I suggest the insertion after the words "" to be "" of the words "" in respect to animals or plants, as the case may be."" Some such words as those should be inserted. The defect to' which I draw attention exists in nearly all the paragraphs. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE' (Hume-Trea surer) [9.50] - The matter to which the honourable member refers is highly technical. I shall pay that attention to his suggestion which it deserves, and shall refer it to the^draftsman. If he agrees with it, I shall propose an amendment to meet the honourable member's view. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [9.51] I move That the following proviso be added to subclause (1) :"" Provided that the powers contained in the * three last preceding paragraphs shall not be exercised unless the Governor General is satisfied and certifies (I.) that the Authorities of the State wherein, it is proposed to put such powers into execution have refused or failed to exercise such powers to the extent or in the manner to or in which the same ought to be exercised in the interests of another State or of the Commonwealth ; or (11.) that the Authorities of such State, having exercised such powers, have done so to an extent or in a manner that prejudicially affects the interests of another State or of the Commonwealth'. Provided further that such powers shall not in any case be exercised by or on behalf of the Commonwealth until after notice of the intention to exercise them shall on each occasion have been given to the Governor of the State whereim it is proposed to exercise the same."" I think that in one or two respects that amendment is better than the amendment which the Minister intends to move at the end of the clause. As it has been gested, in regard to this amendment, that the honourable gentleman has stolen my clothes, I wish to make an explanation which should absolve him from that charge. Yesterday morning, I took the draft of my amendment to the Attorney-General, to consult him on jone or two points connected with it and I feel sure that, had he known that a similar amendment had been prepared at the instance of. another Minister, he would have informed me of the fact. I have since learned that the Government amendment was in the hands of the parliamentary draftsman, unknown to 'the Attorney General.",58
413,Mr GROOM,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I knew that the Treasurer had given instructions to the draftsman to draft an amendment, but I had overrides a State law. not read the draft with sufficient care to be able to criticise the amendment of the hon the 1 orable member for Brisbane.",59
414,Colonel FOXTON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I think it due to the Attorney-General that I should make this explanation. Before dealing with amendment, I may be permitted a passing reference to the remarks of the honourable member for Flinders-wit h which I enan tirely agree, notwithstanding what said by the honourable member for Bendigo- ' in regard to the sphere within which the Commonwealth law when passed will come supreme, superseding the laws of the States. Unless I am much mistakenhave not had an opportunity to look up the Constitution-the Commonwealth could that. have taken over the quarantine departgard ments of the States by proclamation, exis actly as it took over the Defence Departconferred ments, and could have worked them with no greater inefficiency than they are being worked now, so far as oversea quarantine concerned, under conflicting laws and regurights lations. It would have been inconvenient to do so, just as it was inconvenient to trol the defence forces under the separate Defence Acts of the States before a Commonwealth Defence Act was passed. The Commonwealth, however, could have controlled quarantine during the last or six years under the State Acts, making this measure practically a consolidating This view of the question is well worthv of consideration in connection with what was said by the honourable member for itdesirable Flinders. [54]",59
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,The Acts passed by the Commonwealth for the administration of transferred Departments have amplified sugand increased the powers of those Departments.,59
416,Colonel FOXTON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I do not think that the powers of the Commonwealth in regard to any transferred Department are limited by the provisions of the State legislation regarding it. I agree with the honourable , member for Flinders that this Bill will not enable the Commonwealth authority to annul anything done by a State authority in pursuance of its undoubted right of action in respect to such matters as stock quarantine within its own area. If , for the sake of argument, the Government of New South VVales proclaimed a quarantine area within that State, nothing in this Bil l or in the Constitution would enable the Commonwealth to annul it .",59
417,Mr GLYNN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,The Commonwealth law,59
418,Colonel FOXTON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"There is nothing in Bill authorizing Commonwealth quarantine officers to take such action, and I assume that the omission is intentional, and is an admission on the part of the draftsmy man that the Commonwealth authority has not power to annul a State quarantine area made to prevent the spread of disease from infected area to surrounding districts has been within the State territory.",59
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"What is meant by prejudicially affecting the interest of a beState? A quarantine may be rightly exercised, so far as one State is concerned, I and yet prejudicially affect it .",59
420,Colonel FOXTON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I am coming to What I'wish to explain now in reto the second part of my amendment that if , as I believe, there is no power by the Bill or in the Constitution which enables the Commonwealth authority to annul a State quarantine area is created in pursuance of the undoubted of the State', it is unnecessary. ""That part of the amendment was framed Oh the conassumption that the Bill may be read as conferring upon the Commonwealth the right to annul a State quarantine. If the Commonwealth has no such power, the profive vision is mere surplusage. - Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Any exclusion, one. even though it might be legitimate, would prejudicially affect the interest of a State.",59
421,Colonel FOXTON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Yes . I thought to call attention to this matter in case it might be thought I had overlooked it .,59
422,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,Does the honourable member propose to omit paragraph 2?,60
423,Colonel FOXTON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"No ; I think, after what we have heard from the honourable taken. member for Angas, that the paragraph is necessary. This amendment has the advansion tage over that of the Minister in that makes the intervention of the Commonmeans wealth authorities a much more formal matter. The Governor General must be satisfied, and certify that necessity arisen, and, secondly, the notice of the tention to intervene must be given to the of Government of the State affected. It been urged by some who have read the posed amendment that it will create tion, but it seems to me that.the formalities involved are less likely to lead to fricGeneral tion than would a sudden intervention withspecified out notice. As I mentioned last night, the knowledge that it is necessary to formally plants certify, and to give notice, would mean only that instead of .these formalities, there would be a friendly communication as bepowers tween one Government and another, and or experts would be appointed and consulted, so that in all probability the powers would never be exercised.",60
424,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.2] - Some remaiks have been made as to the similarity of the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Brisbane and an amendment which I inback tend to submit myself. I may explain that last Friday one or two honourable members, amongst others the honourable member Franklin, spoke to me on the matter. I had not then decided how far go, but the honourable member whom I have named desired to be able to make some statement in reference to the question in Tasmania. As a result, I gave member instructions that afternoon to the liamentary draftsman to prepare an amendment in harmony with the parts of the Bill. On the following Tuesday, the Attorney-General told me that the draft was ready; and I have to say that I never saw or heard of the amendment of the honourable member for Brisbane until I came here to-night. sorry that the honourable member submitted the amendment, because I cannot accept I regard the proposal which I have had prepared as much more workable than that now before the Committee. For instance, the honourable member for Brisbane desires it provided that the Governor General be satisfied and certify, and I take it that that means certifying before the proclamation is issued.",60
425,Colonel FOXTON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Yes , before action is",60
426,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Such a provimight cause delay in cases where it action is desirable at once, and it also taking some power from the Commonwealth. Then, again, I do not like the words, "" the interests of another State,"" has which might cause some - dispute, and, intherefore, further delay. The wording the proviso is also likely, to has cause delay and hamper the action of the proGovernment. The amendment which I defricsire to have passed is as follows- (3) The powers conferred on the Governorby this section, in relation to the matters in paragraphs (g), (h), and (Â») of subsection (r), so far as they relate to animals or or any disease or pest affecting animals or plants, shall, as regards a State or part of a State, be exercised in cases where the Governor General is satisfied that the exercise of those is necessary for the purpose of preventing the spread of a disease or pest affecting animals plants, beyond the boundaries of that State.",60
427,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,I think that is better than any of the other proposed amendments.,60
428,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Althoug h I gave instructions to have this amendment drafted when the subject was fresh in my mind, I did not circulate it, but kept it with a view to ascertaining whether the debate showed it to be a reasonable request to make on behalf of the States. I for hope the honourable member for Brisbane will accept the amendment I have just read I should in preference to his own.",60
429,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Supposin g the amendment proposed by - the honourable for Brisbane is rejected, will the parMinister be in order in proposing an amendment exactly on all fours with that other of the honourable member?",60
430,The CHAIRMAN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"There is a certain difference in the wording of the two amendments,, and, therefore, I think that that proposed by the Minister would be perfectly in order under the circumstances sugI am gested. For instance, the Committee might desire the amendment, but not in it. the form presented in the first instance.",60
431,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"A question was asked by the honourable member for North Sydney as to why human beings were not included. I take it that the Commonmust wealth should have power in regard to human beings, and to follow persons, who may have gone inland after leaving an fected ship.",60
432,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Is the word ""animals "" intended to include human ings ? Sir' WILLIAM LYNE - No ; the are distinct.",61
433,Mr GLYNN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Angas) [10.14] - The chief difference between the two amendments seems to be that one gets control over human beings, whereas the other does not. I think the'Minister is right, that the States are not likely to object our using our powers in connection with human beings; all the remonstrances have been in connection with animals and plants. Otherwise, however, so far as I can see, the effect of the Minister's amendment really the same as that of member for Brisbane. Would it not be better for the Minister to ask the honourable hours ago. member for Brisbane to accept the Ministhan ter's amendment in substitution for his own? To get over the Minister's objecrepresents tion to the Governor General having to t if y , the words of the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act might be used, so as have the terminology of Acts for the same purpose identical.",61
434,Mr GROOM,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,In quarantine matters the object is to act quickly.,61
435,Mr GLYNN,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Instea d of providing ment. that the Governor General shall be satisfied and certify, we might follow the words of section 16 of the Act I have just mentioned, and say, "" Unless in the ion of the Governor General,"" and so That section also relates to health matters. In regard to jurisdiction, I believe the honourable member for Bendigo put the matter very correctly when he said that the exclusive power under section 52 has nothcases ing to do with our legislative powers, but deals purely with matters of administrafact tion. The point is referred to in Quick and Garran, in which a' deliberate opinion journment. is given after careful consideration. Perhaps honourable members will permit me to read the extractWith respect to the whole of that field, course,, the Federal Parliament has ""power to niake laws"" under section 51, exercise of that power, occupy the whole field, and so exclude every particle of the concurrent jurisdiction of the States; but it is not by this section given ""exclusive power"" over the whole of that field. As a matter of fact, there are provisions in this Bill in regard to pratique which are [54]- 2 looser than those which obtain in the States. inTo that extent these provisions will override those embodied in the States Acts.",61
436,Mr KNOX,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Kooyong) [10.17] - I hail be with satisfaction both the amendment outlined by the honourable member for Bristwo bane and that suggested by the Acting Prime Minister without committing myself to the verbiage of either as an advance in the right direction. At the same time, I would suggest that we have now reached the very kernel of the Bill , and as and the evening is getting late I think that the to Minister should consent to adjourn the debate so as to allow honourable members an opportunity to consider the whole position.",61
437,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Oh , no.",61
438,Mr KNOX,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,The amendment of the is Acting Prime Minister was only distributed the honourable a few minutes ago.,61

441,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,The honourable member is always asking for an adjourn,61
442,Mr KNOX,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"We are entitled to ask for an opportunity to consider the clause. At an earlier stage of the debate, I ventured opinthe opinion that our quarantine powers on. should be limited entirely to oversea ships, to the right to follow diseased persons throughout the States,, and to assert the authority of the Commonwealth in where States displayed negligence. I again urge the Minister-in view of the that some honourable members have gone to their homes-to agree to an ad",61
443,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Wentworth) [10.22] - I hope that the Acting Prime Minister will recognise the fairness of the request which has been made to him. He must realise of that I have endeavoured to assist him with and it may, in the this Bill .",61
444,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"If honourable members will assist me to deal with the clause under consideration, I shall be willing to adjourn.",61
445,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"We have not had the. first amendment suggested by the Acting Prime Minister before us more than a few minutes, and this clause represents the crux of the Bill.

446,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I consented to an early adjournment last night, and I hope the Committee will dispose of this clause before we adjourn.",62
447,Mr KELLY,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"I should like to know the exact nature of the Acting Prime Minister's second amendment. So far I have not had a chance of seeing it in print. This is the best hour to adjourn, if the Acting Prime Minister wishes to facilitate the early passing of the Bill.",62
448,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Robertson) [10.25] - 1 quite agree with the .Acting Prime Minister that he has given ample opportunity for the discussion of this clause. When we were.prepared to go to a division upon it the honourable member for Flinders interposed a constitutional question, despite the fact that the constitutionality or otherwise of our action was very exhaustively discussed yesterday upon the initia-. tive of the honourable member for Angas. It is no new experience for us to find lawyers differing from one another, and the fact that the honourable member for Flinders entertains a different view from that expressed by the honourable member for Angas possibly points to the conclusion that the former is not to be accepted as a great authority upon this question. We must recollect that the honourable member for Angas was a member of the Federal Convention, and is well versed in the constitutionality or otherwise of our. procedure. Certainly his opinion is quite as worthy of acceptance as that of the Honourable member for Flinders - I say that the Acting Prime Minister is taking up a reasonable position in contending that this clause should be dealt with before we adjourn. At the present time two proposals are practically before the Committee. One has been submitted by the honourable member for Brisbane. Had the Acting Prime Minister not suggested another amendment whiMi is terser and very much preferable to that proposed by the honourable member for Brisbane, no doubt we should have been content to accept the latter. But seeing that the proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane necessitates an adverse judgment being given upon the management of the States Quarantine Departments, I think that it would be an act of grace upon his part to withdraw it in favour of. that of the Minister.",62
449,Mr ARCHER,PATENT AND PROPRIETARY,"Capricornia) [10.29] Considerable weight is to be attached to the remarks of the honourable member for Robertson in regard to the wording of the amendment. But his observations only strengthen the request which has been made that honourable members should be afforded a further opportunity to consider this clause. The Minister said that one of his objections to the amendment circulated by the honourable member for Brisbane was that it would involve some delay in giving effect to the law. That, to my mind, is not an objectionable feature. I may say, in passing, that I should have moved the omission of subclause g. had I thought that there was any possibility of securing its excision, since I think that the Commonwealth should not interfere with the internal administration of the States. There is a danger of muchinjury being done to different interests by reason of panic legislation. We have experienced something of the kind in Queensland, notwithstanding that the Administration has had a full knowledge of local conditions. So far, however, the State quarantine laws relating to stock have been excellently carried out, and I see no occasion for the Commonwealth t'o interfere with the internal administration of the States. It is only because I recognised that there was no likelihood of my securing the omission of sub-clause g that I refrained from (proposing such an amendment, and decided to support that circulated by the honourable member for Brisbane as being the most for which we could hope. The delay in taking action, which his proposal might involve, would be a very useful safeguard, for the interests involved are very considerable. In connection with the administration of the Queensland regulations relating to tick and other stock pests, hardship and loss have been suffered as the result of hasty and ill-considered action on the part of the local authorities, and' the danger must be accentuated when we have the Federal authority operating far away from the affected area, and having no knowledge of local conditions. The measures to which the amendment relates are not of great urgency. Before the Federal authority would be asked to step in much work would have been carried out by the State. The power of the Commonwealth would be invoked only when it was thought that the time had arrived when it should step in. I think that the form of the amendment moved by the honourable meming part ber for Brisbane has much to commend it. or Its wording might be so amended as to reexercise move the objection that action under it would appear to be taken by the Commonor wealth only because the States were not properly carrying out the work allotted to them. I , therefore, think it would be fair to give the honourable member an opportunity to discuss the amendment with those who assisted him in drafting it before he is called upon it. If the wording of the amendment were varied so as to remove the objection to which I have referred, I should much prefer it to that foreshadowed by the Minister. Every formality should be observed in invoking Commonwealth interference with the internal arrangements of Such an action should be most circumspect, and the greater the leisure with which it is done, within reasonable limits, the better it' will be. In that way, all chance of friction would be removed, and it is for this reason that I think the Minister should give us an opportunity to consult with the honourable member for Brisbane before the amendment is withdrawn. I suggest that unless that opportunity is given the honourable member for Brisbane should press his amendment, asking leave only to vary its wording. Colonel FOXTON' (Brisbane) [10.35I. - Holding , as I do that the Bill has a tendency to go very much further than I think it ought to do in regard to quarantine matters, it would"" be strange if I did not prefer the more sweeping reservations in my own amendment to those of the amendment foreshadowed by the Minister. Although I prefer my own amendment, more especially as it would compel the observance of certain formalities before the Commonwealth could prevent the. passing of human beings from one State to another, still I recognise that, under existing circumstances, it is more than probable that if I pressed it to a division .it would be rejected in favour of that which the Acting Prime Minister intends to move. In these circumstances, I* ask leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM agreed toTbat the following new sub-clause be added : - "" 13).
