1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 12.30 p.m., and read prayers. NA Delegation to the South Pacific and Papua New Guinea",13
2,Mr NUGENT,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the South Pacific and Papua New Guinea. In view of the tightness of time, I will start my comments on this delegation that went to Tuvalu, Kiribati, Vanuatu and PNG by making sure that I record appropriate thanks for the hard work of a number of people associated with the delegation. First of all, I should mention the Parliamentary Relations Office in this building and staff from DFAT who planned and organised the whole thing in advance. I thank the high commissioners and their staff in the countries we visited. It is always invidious to name people, but I would particularly like to thank Anne Plunkett, our Deputy High Commissioner in Fiji. Fiji looks after Tuvalu and Anne Plunkett went there two or three days in advance. Because of aircraft troubles, she had to stay an extra four or five days before she got out of the place. We are very appreciative of the staff in our various posts. I would like to thank our host countries, particularly the parliaments which hosted us in each of the four countries, for the excellent way that they looked after the delegation. A particular vote of thanks must go to the secretary to the delegation, Grant Harrison, who, on a personal level, found quite unexpectedly whilst we were in the middle of the South Pacific that he was changing jobs. He therefore had some additional challenges to those that are normally associated with that onerous position-and he did an outstanding job. I would like to thank my other colleagues who were on the delegation for the support they gave throughout the time that we were away. Let me make a brief comment about each of the four countries we visited. Tuvalu is a small country covering an area of some 26 square kilometres and with a population of less than 10,000, so it is quite a small island. The highest point is a matter of a few feet. It is a country that is obviously very poor and has incredible economic problems. It survives by sending many hundreds of its young men overseas as seamen on foreign shipping lines. Quite clearly, there is a need for Australian aid, which we already provide, but it will be needed on an ongoirig basis. Kiribati has a population of 77,000, which is smaller in population size than the electorates of any member of this chamber. We were able to visit not only the capital but a number of the outer islands and had a most successful and worthwhile visit there. Vanuatu, quite clearly, is a country with very significant problems. There is a major reform program under way which this country will need to support to get them over a number of their problems. Finally, I would like to say a few words about PNG, which was the last country we visited. We were there about five weeks ago-we got back five weeks ago yesterday. We were in the Highlands and saw the beginning of the terrible drought in Papua New Guinea. Quite clearly, it is an appalling situation. It is important to remember when we look at that drought situation that it is not just about getting food into the various areas and the transportation problems in the short term-although that is very important-but, given the damage that has been done to the crop base, the soil, the seed and so on, it is a long-term problem to be overcome. They have problems with security and, as we have heard in the media, corruption. It is a rich country but with incredible problems . and clearly we have a long way to go before we see PNG on its feet. Given our special relationship, we as a country need to continue to make that commitment on an ongoing basis.",13
3,Mr MOSSFIELD,DELEGATION REPORTS,"In speaking to this report, I can say the joint parliamentary visit to Tuvalu, Kiribati, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea was most opportune for a number of political and environmental reasons that were well reported prior to our visit. I would like to thank the leader of the delegation, the member for Aston, Peter Nugent, for his firm leadership. I thank other members of the delegation, including the members for Longman (Mr Brough) and Swan (Mr Randall) and the delegate secretary, Grant Harrison, for what proved to be a busy, informative but enjoyable parliamentary visit. The visit allowed the delegation to appreciate the importance of environmental issues to our Pacific neighbours. We were also able to establish personal contact with a number of political leaders from nations visited. ParticuQueensland. larly on Tuvalu and Kiribati, delegates were made aware of the small land mass constituting these two countries. Both nations were in most cases only a few metres above sea level, with very little arable land available to grow crops. For example, Kiribati consists of 33 low-lying coral atolls spread over 3.5 million square kilometres. To give members an understanding of the area covered by the 33 atolls, they cover an area equivalent to that the east to the west coast of Australia. We were told that some children had to travel by boat for several weeks from some of the outer islands to attend school, and remained at school for the whole year. The delegates were treated to fine dancing and singing performances at several schools we visited in Kiribati. In particular, to congratulate the staff and students of the Immaculate Heart College, North Tarawa, Saint Joseph's College and Whitmee High School on the island of Abaiang. Mention should also be made of the tremendous work being carried out by Australian religious orders and lay people from many other parts of the world in educating children at the above mentioned schools. We saw evidence of Australian aid spent on education and I would say that any further Australian aid for education in this part of the world would be well spent. The delegation had the pleasure of meeting with President Tito; Mr Tamuera, the Speaker of the parliament; and members of the Kiribati cabinet. The president and his ministers showed their interest in the Australian delegation and their desire to have close ties with Australia at both the political and social level. In Vanuatu the delegation visited a hospital on the island of Tanna which was poorly equipped, by our standards, and was in danger of running out of fuel for its generator due to a shipping dispute. I was very pleased to hear from a Canadian doctor in charge of this hospital that a solar hot water system had been installed by Australian volunteers from the Rotary Club at Oberon in New South Wales and that a similar project was, being planned by the Rotary Club of Mooloolaba in This was a fine example of a community in Australia assisting one of our Pacific nations. While in Vanuatu the delegation was briefed on a comprehensive reform program which is designed to improve the standard of government, the economy and service to the people. In Papua New Guinea there was a general agreement amongst politicians and public servants we met that law and order issues of were having a major impact on the economy. While there are many firie tourist attractions throughout Papua New Guinea, including the national museum and botanical gardens in Port Moresby, tourists would be reluctant to visit this place until law and order issues were resolved. Australian aid is being well spent on training the police force and in providing I would like infrastructure facilities. The most interesting part of our short stay in Papua New Guinea was our visit to Mount Hagen and the Highlands. Here we saw the effects of the drought in the Simbu province. In this province, only three per cent of the population are engaged in either private or government organisations. The rest of the population, numbering over 250,000, depend on subsistence agriculture. The province normally has daily rainfall and is usually covered with tropical rainforest and grasslands. However, drought and frost have reduced this region to a dust bowl. What appeared obvious was that very little attempt was made to preserve water on a family by family basis.",13

7,Mrs BAILEY,COMMITTEES,"-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs I present the committee's report on a visit to New Zealand-16-19 June 1997entitled Development in New Zealand agriculture. Ordered that the report be printed.",15
8,Mrs BAILEY,COMMITTEES,"This visit not only provided members with the opportunity to investigate issues relevant to our current inquiry trade reform but, having recently completed an inquiry into the management of Australian fisheries, we were also keen to assess the reform of New Zealand's fisheries management. Chapter 3 of this report details our assessment and provides a further recommendation to be considered with recommendation 37 in our report, The last frontier. The committee spent 31h full days of consultation with the New Zealand ministries of economic research, forestry, agriculture and fisheries; the Agricultural Industry Training Organisation; the Maori Land Court; the Business Round Table; the Apple and Pear Marketing Board; the Dairy Board; the Fruit growers Federation; the Meat Industry Association and Producer Board; the Kiwifruit Marketing Board; the Poultry Industry Association; the Federation of Farmers Association; and Mount Albert Horticultural Research Centre. We also met with relevant ministers and the Speaker of the New Zealand parliament, and joined in discussions with the New Zealand Select Committee on Primary Production. As well as examining the innovative ways in which New Zealand has managed to be so export focused and has developed niche markets, the committee was particularly interested to investigate the amount of information available at all levels of the production, marketing and distribution chain, how this information was disseminated and its value. Quarantine and bio-security were issues of importance to the committee, given our trade inquiry and that our visit coincided with the fireblight controversy. Forthright discussions were held on the question of appropriate protocols for the collection and removal of Report samples of allegedly diseased material and on New Zealand's application to export apples from anywhere in New Zealand to Australia. Depending on the confirmation of the presence of fireblight in Australia, the stated intention by New Zealand is to pursue the ban by Australia on New Zealand apples in the arbitration tribunal of the WTO. In line with its strong push for exports, New Zealand is pressing Australia to hasten its time frame for risk analysis of New Zeainto land uncooked salmon meat into Australia. Gi ven that New Zealand has accepted uncooked salmon from Canada, the USA and China, the committee reiterated that Australian authorities are rightly wary. However, these examples demonstrate New Zealand's tenacity and fiercely competitive focus on export markets, regardless of the goodwill that exists between our two countries, illustrated with CER. Two particular areas of New Zealand reform and innovation that impressed us were the reform of producer boards and the development of a bio-security council. The aim of the producer board reform is to make these boards more accountable to industry and more flexible in their commercial operations. Boards will focus on promotion, market development and research rather than on statutory· requirements. Given that biosecurity is an integral part of global trade, the New Zealand Bio-Security Council is under the control of the Minister for Agriculture and International Trade and includes independent scientific expertise as well as the resources government agencies coordinating the best people for risk assessment and research a-ailable and able to cooperate across agenCIes. New Zealand vigorously pursues export markets and continues the reform program it began in the late 1980s with the withdrawal of industry subsidies. It maintains an aggressive marketing strategy, with strong emphasis on brand development, and is well placed to take advantage of market changes as trade liberalisation continues. In conclusion, each of our countries is a small player in global terms and it would be to our mutual benefit for both countries to cooperate in overcoming problems like market access. I thank you, Mr Speaker, for making this visit possible. I would also like to place on record our appreciation to our New Zealand hosts for organising such a detailed visit for us. Such a detailed visit led to the very successful visit that we had, including the wide-ranging topics that we raised. (Extension of time granted) Given that I now have a little more time than I had originally thought, I would like to make mention of a couple of important areas that committee members found of great interest. One in particular was the industry training developments that are taking place in New Zealand. New Zealand has established a range of industry' training organisations to increase the work force skills and both onand off-job training. This is particularly that it provides a number of opportunities for young people to learn on a first-hand basis as well as get the theoretical training. It adds to the skill of their work force. One of the illustrations to us was the development of the model farm example where many young people are able to spend time on farms. This is of course in line with the training that they receive at institutions like TAFE, and young people are given credit for this. Another example is the demand that New Zealand places on brand development, the vigorous way they pursue their forays into international markets and their development of niche markets. Everyone would be extremely familiar with the term 'kiwi fruit'. It of may be of interest to members to know that Italy produces more kiwi fruit than New Zealand, but if you were to travel around Italy and ask Italians where kiwi fruit is from they . will always offer that it is from New Zealand. In line with pushing this brand and developing further market strategies, the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board is quite a separate organisation from a recently launched board known as Zespri International, which markets kiwi fruit under the distinctive brand of Zespri. Zespri International maintains a completely separate role from the Kiwifruit Marketing Board, which is a statutory industry management authority and is responsible for the regulatory functions. Zespri International has launched a separate marketing strategy which allows it to operate at arms length from the growers and gives it much more flexibility. This is in line with the major area of reform which the New Zealand government has undertaken, and that is the reform of most of its producer boards, which is giving it flexibility to be much more accountable to industry and to act in a much more commercial way. Zespri International is a prime example of that, and we were privileged to see much of the new advertising material that they have recently launched. Another area of great interest to the committ-e was the way some of the other industry bodIes operate. The New Zealand Dairy Board has some excellent runs on the board so in once again establishing a very firm brand name, and has established itself as a force to be reckoned with. (Time expired)",15

Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee",16
12,Mr ANDREWS,COMMITTEES,"Menzies) (12.49 p.m.)On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present committee's report entitled Review of Auditor General's audit report No. 33-1996-97-The administration of the Family Court of Australia, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",17
13,Mr ANDREWS,COMMITTEES,"The audit report was conducted in order to 'assess the economy, efficiency, effectiveness and accountability the court's administrative functions'. The committee was well aware of the fact that the Family Court has been under almost constant review since it commenced work in 1976. There is a delicate balance between the positive and negative effects of scrutiny. There comes a time when improvements to efficiency, which often result from review, may be offset by the burden on the resources of an institution, caused by the need to meet a reviewer's requirements. The committee considers that the court should be permitted a period of consolidation before being subject to further major reviews, though we do not consider that scrutiny such as that conducted by parliamentary estimates committees should be delayed. Because of the number of reviews of the Family Court, coupled with the desire to avoid the waste of public resources by duplicating the work invested by these other reviewers, the committee chose to conduct a limited review of the report by the Australian National Audit Office. Our report considers the conduct and scope of the audit and focuses on some of the major issues confronting the administration of the court as it approaches the 21st century. The court reduced the number of administrative regions from three to two following the recommendations of the Coal drake report in 1996. The ANAO considers that regional management makes little contribution from an organisational viewpoint to the operation of the court and recommends that it be abolished. The court disagreed with this finding. The matter was addressed by a further report to the court by Professor Coal drake this Report year. As a result of this report, the court has decided to abolish the regional structure and replace it with an area. structure with two headquarters-one in Sydney and one in the Melbourne. Professor Coal drake recommended that the court either commit itself to the regional structure and make it more efficient or, alternatively, explore a structure based on areas but different administratively to the regional structure. The committee notes that the court found Professor Coaldrake's assessment of the top structure requirements of the court particularly helpful. The court has now of prepared a timetable for implementing the various aspects of the Coal drake report; hence, the result desired by the ANAO will be achieved but. by another route. The committee also addresses the matter of the location of primary dispute resolution services, including counselling. The Attorney General's Department issued a discussion paper on this issue in August. The committee hopes its comments will be useful to the department as it contemplates the delivery of these important services. The court's focus on encouraging separating couples to avoid litigation makes counselling, conciliation and mediation integral aspects of the court's administration. The committee recognises that clients should have a choice between using court provided services and assessing the same sort of services in the wider community, provided the community based services are of the same professional standard as those delivered by the court. Protection from the risk of domestic violence should also be of the same high quality and standard. The committee did not take extensive evidence in the context of our review of the audit report, so we do not make recommendations on the delivery of primary dispute resolution services at this stage. However, we urge caution on those who are seeking to change the status quo. The committee considers that there is a prima facie case for these primary dispute resolution services to continue to be provided· by the court. The onus should be on those who consider they can design a better model to demonstrate how this could be achieved. The committee will have further comments to make on this subject in its forthcoming report on aspects of family services. That report will not be presented until next year, which is why I am making a brief comment on this matter now. In conclusion, the committee notes that the audit report finds that, in general, the Family Court is well focused on moving towards best practice. While it is meeting its performance targets only in some areas, it still compares well with the Family Court of Western Australia and other Australian superior courts. I thank the secretariat for their work and, in particular, the secretary, Mrs Judy Middlebrook. I commend the report to the House.",17
14,Mr MCCLELLAND,COMMITTEES,"At the outset of my remarks, I would echo the chairman's thanks to the secretariat and also to Ms Judy Middlebrook, who I understand is leaving the committee shortly, in a week or so. She has been really first class. In any field, she would be right amongst the top. She has been of tremendous benefit to the committee.",18
15,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,She will be a real loss.,18
16,Mr MCCLELLAND,COMMITTEES,"She will be a real loss, and I thank the member for his comment. As the chairman indicated, the Family Court has been under virtually constant review since its inception in 1976. We are of the view that there comes a time when there is no point in doing further reviews; it is time for people to get their hands dirty and sort out the way forward, as a result of those reviews. In particular, in terms of the Auditor General's report, it would be regrettable indeed if the report were regarded as an edict from on high and there were not that ongoing continuous cooperation between officers of the Family Court and the Auditor-General's office in terms of working through the various recommendations. As we note, yes, while there were things for improvement, on the whole the court structure is operating efficiently. I should say that there is always a delicate balance in the parliament reviewing the administration of a court structure, given the separation of powers. However, at no stage have the Family Court sought to rely on that separation and say that they are not open to review in terms of at least their administrative processes-and we say that is entirely appropriate. But one comment that I should make is the recommendation of the committee-I would summarise it as 'tread with caution'-in terms of any contemplation of outsourcing of the primary dispute resolution services. They include not only counselling but also conciliation and mediation. While I think it is fair to say that counselling could be provided by outside non-government agencies, when we come to the intensity of conciliation and mediation in very emotional dispute circumstances that we have all witnessed in our electoral offices, there is significant doubt, in my view, that the non-government agencies could cope with that in the context of trying to achieve an outcome of resolution of the legal process without resorting to litigation. I think it is naive to suggest that the NGOs could in 'those circumstances have the knowledge of the court process or the knowledge of judicial precedent sufficient to guide the parties. Indeed, the risk is that, if they do not have that knowledge, they will misguide the parties in terms of what they have to contemplate in resolving the litigation. I fear that outsourcing could be more a part of a philosophical commitment towards contracting out government services rather than really looking at just what is achieved through the mediation processes of the Family Court. Certainly, if you look at the number of cases settled, if that did not occur, the court would be in real trouble-indeed, the government's coffers would be in real trouble because of the greater commitment of resources to a litigation outcome than to a mediated outcome. That leaves aside the social consequences of people who have an ongoing relationship in very many circumstances because of their mutual obligation to children not having worked out their arrangement voluntarily and having it determined by a judge. Again, we recommend that the government exercise extreme caution in this contemplation of outsourcing, because it could be the ultimate of 'penny wise and pound foolish'. But there will be more said on that in the coming year.",18

20,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Australia-Indonesia maritime delimitation treaty-12th report, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",19
21,Mr TA YLOR,COMMITTEES,"Mr Speaker, the important report I table today deals with the Australiaboundary Indonesia Maritime Delimitation Treaty. It is ground breaking because it further establishes MOU. the seabed and water column boundaries between the two countries after two decades of deliberation. Because of this, I believe further debate is appropriate in the Main Committee. The treaty represents a very satisfactory outcome for Australia. Accordingly, we have recommended ratification, as well as commenting on a number of other important matters. The treaty establishes separate water column and seabed boundaries that result in areas of overlapping jurisdiction. Based on historical precedent, any solution to the maritime boundaries between the two countries was going to involve separate boundaries. This represents a fair and equitable outcome. However, it will require a degree of mutual cooperation and careful management. We have recommended that the government identify and advertise widely the points of contact in various government departments which will have responsibility for coordinating dispute resolution in the overlapping areas. While we heard evidence on Christmas Island that the local community sought an equidistant boundary with Indonesia, we believe that, had that particular boundary gone to international arbitration, then the negotiated outcome would have been the best Australia could have expected. We also heard evidence from East Timor support groups disputing Australia's right to enter into a treaty with Indonesia which would impact on the people of East Timor. We accepted, however, that this and previous governments have recognised Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. The issue of Indonesian traditional fisher access to the area prescribed by the 1974 MOU was also raised as a matter requiring clarification. We agree that, while moving the boundary a further 12 nautical miles to the north of the Ashmore Islands represents a significant gain for Australia, it nevertheless creates an anomaly with the current MOU boundary which impacts on the issue of enforcement. In light of this change, we have recommended further review of the We are convinced that this treaty will create certainty regarding the matter of resource exploration and exploitation, particularly in relation to potential oil and gas fields. In relation to shared resources, such as fish stocks, we have recommended that the government review existing agreements with Indonesia to ensure that suitable management controls are in place. During our public hearing on Christmas Island, a number of important environmental and immigration issues were raised with us by the local community. We have recommended that the government establish cooperative marine scientific research provisions with Indonesia, particularly in relation to the Abbott's booby, and that it review the issues of illegal immigration and marine pollution. The issue of consultation was again a matter of concern and committee debate. Of fundamental concern was the fact that at no stage in the process was the community of Christmas Island appropriately consulted. We believe that, at the very least, this remote island community should have been given the opportunity to put forward its views in preparing the national interest analysis. We have recommended that departmental officials go to Christmas Island and conduct a thorough briefing with officials and the local community before the treaty is ratified. Furthermore, we heard conflicting statements from Western Australian and Northern Territory departments over the level and adequacy of consultation throughout the process. It has not been possible, however, to ascertain definitively whether this was a breakdown of the Commonwealth, state and territory consultative process or a breakdown in consultation between the states and territorthis ies. This inquiry was an interesting and challenging task, dealing with a relationship of fundamental importance to Australia. The treaty serves as a model of bilateral cooperation in the region. This would not have been possible without the productive dialogue between our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and Indonesian Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",19
22,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,COMMITTEES,"Any treaty with Indonesia has to tread a very dangerous tightrope in regard to attitudes within this parliament. I commend the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties as a reasonable compromise in the circumstances. It is vital that the report incorporated in 7.36 a statement that this treaty: ... does not mean, however, that we endorse the manner in which East Timor was incorporated Indonesia, nor that reported continuing human rights violations being perpetrated against the East Timorese people should be ignored. Furthermore, in 7.37 the report says of the committee: We acknowledge the force of submissions by East Timorese groups that they did not have an opportunity to participate in the process. We thank these groups for their involvement in this Inquiry. As the chair of the committee indicated, there is a degree of disquiet within the committee about the consultation process that occurred in coming to today's tabling. The committee commented that 'the consultation process in relation to Christmas Island was inadequate and re-emphasises the importance of involving all Australians, no matter how remote, in the consultation process'. Indeed, committee members, a number of whom are present today, went to Christmas Island, Darwin and Perth in the process. The committee was very concerned that 2,000 Australians-whether it be because of a breakdown in communications or because of confusion as to who was representing them or whatever-did not get a proper look in in process. That is crucial not only because they are remote and they are Australians but also because there were some very vital issues related to their particular vicinity. For example, the issue of pollution was raised. In 1996, 490-odd people seeking refugee status in this country chose to go through Christmas Island. As the chair alluded, there is the question of the Abbott's booby, a large sea bird of which there is limited knowledge of its terrestrial biology and, therefore, limited knowledge of very crucial aspects of its long-term preservation. The committee has put on the record the hope that in future the department will make sure that in the NIA or at the beginning of the process in which we will be involved we get a list of those who were consulted. The report also stated that there should be a review of the 1974 traditional fisher memorandum of understanding with Indonesia in light of the changes to the exclusive economic zone boundary. I understand that takes up 4.7, where the Fisheries Department of Western into Australia indicated some grave concerns about: . .. the continuance of unconstrained fishing activity by Indonesian fishers. The department would allow little opportunity for effective managevices ment to take place. Again, the committee has taken on board those aspects. As I have said, we come to this report on the agreement with Indonesia saying that there is no way that we condone the colonial presence there. This is a matter of some dispute and some difference in the parliament. Australian governments of all varieties have accepted the de jure recognition of that occupation. However, this committee has brought down a reasonable compromise, saying that the fact that we have come to this agreement with Indonesia is in no way related to our assessment of human rights abuses in Timor.",20

Family and Community Affairs Committee",21
26,Mr FORREST,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, I present the committee's summary report entitled Men's health, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",21
27,Mr FORREST,COMMITTEES,"The report I have just tabled deals with an area of health care which has only recently received prominence. Until the last few years, it has been assumed that men's health has been addressed adequately through the provision of general health serto the community. Moreover, the identification of men's health as a special need was seen as irrelevant in many health and academic circles. However, it has become evident that the health system may not be providing the best care or appropriate services for many men who are reluctant to utilise existing services and facilities unless it is absolutely essential. This makes preventive approaches to men's health very difficult to design or implement. The member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) would be very interested in that. Members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs decided to provide a greater focus on the particular health status of men in the Australian community and undertook to conduct a seminar at Parliament House to encourage debate and to promote the necessity for direct action at the national level. The men's health seminar was convened in September this year, in order to gather information from a range of academics, - general practitioners, health workers and other experts to give committee members a broader appreciation of the complex issues involved. The seminar also provided an opportunity for peak health, community and men's support organisations to exchange information and contribute to the discussion of key issues. Mortality statistics provide a stark illustration of the disturbing state of men's health. Males experience higher mortality rates at all ages compared with females, rising to a peak of 2.65 male deaths for every female death in Report the 15 to 24 age group. Men also have higher mortality rates for all major causes of death. For example, working age men between 24 and 64 years of age have death rates 3.53 times higher for cardiovascular disease, 1.94 times higher for cancers and 3.28 times higher for injury than that for working age women. Male adult suicide is also noticeably higher than it is for women. The major outcomes of the seminar's proceedings provided a clear description of men's poor health status, which extends beyond standard health measures to broader aspects of men's well-being and quality of life; an identification of the neglect of the health system to systematically identify and address the impact that 'maleness' has on a range of important men's health issues; and a range of constructive strategies to support and strengthen the existing responses to these problems at the community, regional, state and national levels. Committee members considered that the information provided at the seminar should be disseminated as widely as possible and, for this reason, resolved to produce a summary report, tabled today, which would further focus discussion. The report also contains a series of recommendations designed to improve the current delivery of services and provide a national structure to refine education prevention programs and treatment and support services. I hope that all members of the House will read the committee's report, and I urge the government to act on its recommendations. I would like to thank Mr Michael Tynan, who provided the secretariat with valuable expertise and support in the design and organisation of this very worthwhile seminar, as well as the hard working secretariat. I give particular thanks to Mr Richard Fletcher, who facilitated the day's activities during the seminar. I commend the report to the House. To all my male colleagues around the place: this report calls on them to pay particular attention to their health needs.",21
28,Ms ELLIS,COMMITTEES,"The men's health seminar, held by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, has provided a valuable insight into the state of men's health in this country. The statistics speak for themselves. The previous speaker and chair of the committee, the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) has mentioned some of them, but I am going to repeat them because it will illustrate the effect these statistics on the committee. Males experience higher mortality rates at all ages compared with females. There are 2.65 male deaths for every female death in the 15 to 24 age group. Men also have higher mortality rates for all the major causes of death. Working age men aged 25 to 64 have death rates 3.53 times higher for cardiovascular disease, 1.94 times higher for cancers and 3.28 times for injury than those of working age women. Information explaining the statistics in more detail are outlined in the report. While some research work looking at many aspects of men's health has been done, it is worth noting that in the Department of Health and Family Services's summary of all the general practice divisional projects between 1993 and 1996 only one page out of 125 pages, with each page summarising about 12 projects, deals specifically with men's health. That outlines very clearly the problem that we are looking at. The major outcomes of the seminar included a clear description of men's poor health status, which extends beyond standard health measures to broader aspects of men's health, and a range of constructive strategies to support and strengthen the existing responses to the problems highlighted at the community, regional, state and national levels. There are some basic questions and some broader questions which became very evident to me, as a female member of the seminar, when I sat as a member of that committee. Why is it, I asked, that men go to their GP far less freq-ently than women? It cannot be because they are always well, because the statistics show us that they are dying younger. Why do they not use community health centres more frequently? Why do they allow symptoms to persist longer when so many diseases they are suffering from are treatable? These are the questions we need to address, and these are the questions that this seminar has highlighted. I thoroughly recommend this report to all members, both male and female, in this House. I commend the recommendations contained in the summary report. It is exhad tremely important that the work that goes into a report like this from this committee be measured in value by its exposure to the community. I hope that we as a committee are able to make as many copies of this report available as possible to a broad ranging area of health practitioners within the community. I would also like to place on record my thanks and the thanks of my colleagues to all those people who participated so openly and so constructively in this very important area of inquiry. Men's health is an obvious area of concern which we simply must address. I also acknowledge the valuable work and assistance of all the committee secretariat, including Bjarne Nordin, Michael Tynan, Bronwen Jaggers and Belinda Shepherd. This was a report and a seminar I was very pleased to participate in. I highly recommend the report to all members of the House.",22

30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting, and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. It being 1.15 p.m., in accordance with standing order 102C the time for consideration of committee and delegation reports has concluded. NA Private Health Insurance: Compensation Mr FITZGmBON (Hunter) (1.15 p.m.)-I move: That this House: (1) notes that Australians who have sustained an injury or been involved in an accident which may be the subject of a claim for compensation are unable to claim benefits from private health insurers to assist with the payment of medical and other costs incurred as a result the accident or injury; (2) is concerned at the extreme hardship this creates for many Australians and Australian families, often extending over many years; and (3) calls on the Government to present to the House, as a matter of urgency, a bill which will: (a) require private health insurers to pay provisional benefits to claimants in respect of services which are the subject of compensation claims; and (b) provide for private health insurers to be reimbursed for these payments from the compensation paid when this occurs. We have a wonderfully universal health system in this country which ensures that all Australians, regardless of their means, have access to decent medical treatment when needed. But Medicare cannot survive without the existence of a strong private health insurance industry. In recent years, as all members know, we have seen a dramatic decline in the number of people participating in that private health insurance industry. Currently about 31 per cent of us have private health insurance compared with about 50 per cent just back in 1984. It has to be said that neither side of politics has done a very good job of slowing down that decline or enhancing the number of people who are covered by private health insurance. There are a number of reasons why the numbers have declined over that period, but the issue I raise with the House today is probably not one of them. Most privately insured Australians are not aware that the fine print in their contractual arrangement with the insurer does not cover them in all circumstances. As they grow more aware-I intend to be out there ensuring that that awareness grows-more and more people will drop out Claims of private health insurance and the strain on the industry will become greater and greater. This is an issue which must be addressed. Currently, most of our privately insured believe that, if they are in an accident, they are covered for medical insurance-that is, if they are not covered by Medicare or some other compensation, they have their private health insurance to fall back on. But they are of very wrong, as was one of my constituents, Mr Bill Vercoe. Mr Vercoe was a selfemployed painter. He had top cover with NIB, something that cost him around $2,000 every year. In March 1994 Mr Vercoe was involved in a car accident. He was not the driver at fault. Understandably, as the driver of the other car was registered and therefore had third party personal insurance, because Mr Vercoe had top cover through NIB, he believed that medical insurance would be the least of his concerns. He was badly injured. He believed that all that money he had invested in private health insurance had been worthwhile on the day of his accident. But, to his shock and horror, he later learned that NIB will not pay any amount to cover his medical expenses whenever the accident is or may be subject to a compensation claim. 'Read our book,' NIB told him soon after the accident. As an aside, Mr Vercoe also had cover for his self-employment in case he was sick or hurt and unable to work. It took him a long time and a long battle with that private insurer before they were prepared to cover his loss. of wages. Compensation claims are not settled overnight, especially in Mr Vercoe's case. In this case CIC were the insurer. They challenged the extent to which the accident contributed to the injuries in question. It can take years for a settlement, and in Mr Vercoe's case it did. NIB, National Mutual Health Insurance, HCF, MBF and Medicare Private-between them they cover around 70 per cent of alI those who are privately insured-have within their rule books clauses which specifically remove their liability in circumstances where the sickness or injury is or could be subject to a compensation claim. Some of them, despite this clause, will make a provisional payment on the basis that the insured enters into a deed to repay the amount out of their compensation settlement when it is eventually received. Any such decision remains totalIy a matter for the discretion of the fund. But, NIB's case, no such service was offered at all. NIB disgracefulIy left Mr Vercoe to sink or swim. If it was not for the fact that Mr Vercoe had worked hard for many years and taken a responsible attitude to savings, he would have sunk. The same would have occurred with Mr and Mrs Col MCKew of Edgeworth in the electorate of the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). Col's 18-year-old son, Anthony, was severely injured in a car accident in February. They almost lost their son; indeed, it is a miracle he is still alive. Who was the private health insurer, Mr Deputy Speaker? You guessed it-NIB. Because there was an element of contributory negligence in this case, Anthony'S compensation case will no doubt drag on for years. In the meantime, his parents have been lucky enough to have good friends willing to lend them the money to cover medical expenses in between the date of his injury and the date when the compensation case may be settled. Like Bill Vercoe, the MCKews thought they would be okay in the event of such a crisis. They contributed to their fund in good faith, not aware how important it was to read the fine print. To his credit, Mr Vercoe has not taken the matter lying down. He has waged a public relations exercise against NIB, he has taken out newspaper as discouraging people from joining the fund and encouraging them to leave, he has distributed pamphlets on the streets of Newcastle and he has had NIB threaten to sue him. But Mr Vercoe fights on fearlessly because he knows right is on his side. Mr Vercoe has had his house broken into on three occasions since he began to wage this war with NIB. When I first heard he made the charge that NIB had been somehow involved, I took it lightly as welI-as I am sure most honourable members will-but as time has gone on I have begun to wonder. On each occasion his house was broken into nothing was touched other than the reams of paperwork Mr Vercoe has accumulated on his research into this very important matter which has had such a devastating impact upon him. When I originally took up this matter, it in was my intention to introduce a private member's bill seeking to amend the Health Insurance Act 1974 and the National Health Act 1954 so far as was necessary to force the funds to make provisional payments in the case of compensation matters. However, I soon learned that the drafting of the legislation was so complex that it would need to be a matter for the government. So I have chosen to use a private member's motion to highlight the problem in the hope that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) will take up the cause and introduce a bill to fix the problem, and I implore him to do so. While there is no doubt that the health funds will resist this with some vigour and will not be prepared to be banker for those who are injured, we now have some pretty hefty support on our side. Let me say that I do not care if the legislation has within it a provision that interest be charged. I know Mr Vercoe would have been in a much better position if NIB had covered his costs between the time of the accident and the settlement of his compensation claim and charged him interest on that bank amount. He would have been much better off than he was under the current arrangements, as would have been Mr and Mrs Colin MCKew. But now, as I said, we have some hefty support on our side. In her 1997 annual report, the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner, Ms Mary Perrett, has given her support to the proposal. On page 38 she reports: Health funds should be required to pay benefits treatment covered by damages and compensation rights, as long as the members concerned enter enforceable undertakings with the health funds to take responsible steps to pay back the money eventually. When I was contemplating submitting a private member's bill on the matter, I did what I thought was a responsible thing and wrote to all the major funds seeking comment from them. I got not one reply. (Time expired)",23
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Nehl}-Is the motion seconded? Mr MCClelland-1 second the motion and I reserve my right to speak.,25
32,Dr SOUTHCOTT,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Boothby) (1.26 p.m.)The issue of compensation for people under public liability or workers compensation is an enormously complex area, and often it does not just involve one fund or one claimant. For example, in the case that the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) mentioned-the case of Ms White-in the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner report, one of the problems that emerged from that case was that there were three different entities that were publicly liable. It is an extremely complex area where a number of parties can be involved and not just the claimant. So, in any private member's bill or any piece of legislation, it would be difficult to put together legislation which would not be unfair and which would actually protect the health funds. The member for Hunter mentioned that one of the problems with private health has been the declining levels of private health insurance. That is a problem which has concerned this government. The Productivity Commission inquiry report, which came out earlier this year, dealt with some of the problems for the decline in private health insurance. Despite the speech we have had this afternoon, I scanned through the Productivity Commission's report on private health insurance and it did not mention the issue of compensation once. I could not find it anywhere. I know the member for Hunter made a submission to the Productivity Commission on that subject. But, in actual fact, they documented that a spiral had occurred-a cycle. In that cycle, as premiums rose and payouts increased, you had adverse selection where the elderly and for people who were more likely to make claims stayed in the funds while the young and fit and healthy pulled out. They also said that there were almost two different periods in the Hawke-Keating government where, during the 1980s, several decisions were taken by the Hawke government in the period 1986 to 1988 which directly led to an increase in premiums. Those government decisions, the Productivity Commission estimated, were responsible for about 30 per cent of the increases in private health insurance premiums. Access Economics has estimated that those decisions increased the cost of premiums by 39 per cent. This was caused by things like removing the Commonwealth bed day subsidy, changing the Medicare rebate from 85 per cent to 75 per cent for inpatient stays, the 1993 Medicare agreements which encouraged public hospitals to increase their throughput of public hospitals and removing the Commonwealth contribution to the private reinsurance pool. All of those things led to an explosion in premiums in the period 1986 to 1988 of over 40 per cent. More recently in the 1990s, as they documented, the major factor which has seen a rise in the premiums of private health insurance has been the increasing use of private patients of private hospitals. That is responseen sible for something like 30 per cent of the increase in premiums. Many people know, anecdotally, that. private hospitals now offer a much greater range of services than they used to, and private patients are able to be seen in private hospitals. But that is a lot more expensive. Returning to the private member's motion, it is important to realise that one of the problems this motion could create is the problem of double dipping. In the area of Medicare benefits and nursing home benefits, it was noticed by the previous government that double dipping was a particular problem whereby people would be paid Medicare or nursing home benefits but had actually received compensation and not reimbursed the Commonwealth. The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), when a parliamentary secretary and speaking on the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Bill 1994, referred to double dipping and a review of the relationship between compensation and health and community service programs which found that many people receiving compensation designed to meet the full cost of injury related, medical and other needs do not reimburse the Commonwealth. They double-dip by receiving free or heavily subsidised services funded by the Commonwealth as well as compensation for the full cost of those services. The member for Hunter also mentioned the complaints commissioner. Regarding the specific recommendations of the complaints commission, the commissioner suggested, as the honourable member mentioned, that health funds should be required to pay benefits for the treatment covered by damages and compensation rights as long as the members concerned enter enforceable undertakings with the health funds to take reasonable steps to pay back the money eventually. Repayment would occur if and when the claims for damages or compensation were finalised successfully. In a letter to Ms Perrett, Russell Schneider, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Health Insurance Association, responded that the comments about compensation need to be in the light of a long standing industry dispute involving compensation insurers, Medicare and the legal profession in relation to sweetheart compensation deals. Sweetheart deals have been a long standing problem in the area of compensation. In sweetheart deals lawyers agree not to pursue medical damages if the fund has already paid. That puts the claimant at a disadvantage when they find that neither Medicare nor the fund wish to pay for the liability for which another insurer, the compensation insurer, has charged a premium. Effectively, this motion is asking private health funds to act as a bank in cases where, for example, a work cover insurer has already accepted a premium on the guarantee that they will payout in the case of a workers compensation liability or a public liability insurer has received a premium on the guarantee that they will payout in the case of a public compensation liability, and pay for something that the public liability insurers or the work cover insurers have already accepted a premium for. I have a lot of sympathy for the constituents care mentioned by the member for Hunter and the constituent from the electorate of the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), but it needs to be remembered that these cases are not typical. Most compensation cases are resolved quickly. In actual fact, if there are any out-ofpocket expenses, more often that rests with the hospital or the doctor concerned in that the bills are often made directly to work cover or to the insurer. Another issue that this motion raises is whether we can do it. Under the National Health Act we have very wide powers to legislate for private health insurance, but the issue of compensable schemes and compensation has always been recognised as a matter for the states and it is generally a state government responsibility. Things like workers compensation and so on are administered through public hospitals. One problem I have with the motion is that forcing· the funds to pay for a compensable injury could be another factor leading to further premium rises. I know that the member for Hunter outlined in a previous speech on the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill his concerns about private health insurance premiums rising. We are looking at trying to constrain the amount by which premiums rise. Any premium rise has to be approved by a committee consisting of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the health minister. Health funds have been told they cannot raise premiums just to go onto their bottom line. They have to be for the specific purpose of topping up their reserves. Regarding some of the cases we have heard about, including that outlined in the complaints commission report, court hearings can be extremely protracted in this area. That is where there is a problem. As the member for Hunter recognised, the funds do have the discretion to make a payout if they wish in those circumstances. If people are concerned that this may be a problem, they should, as with most things, shop around. Most of the funds do not offer insurance payments-(Time expired)",25
33,Mr MCCLELLAND,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Barton) (1.36 p.m.)One wonders whether the honourable member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) was giving a speech on behalf of constituents within his electorate or on behalf of the health insurance funds. There is an unquestioned delay in these matters coming to court. Whether it is a car accident or a workers compensation case, as the member for Boothby said in his opening remarks, cases can often be complex. They can often be complex because of dispute about liability-there may have been a previous injury or other insurers involved. Notoriously, compensation cases take at least 12 months but usually 14 months, and a District Court or Supreme Court case up to two years or even longer. To say that the worker and his family have to suffer the injustice of being without treatment for that period is harsh in the extreme. Not only is it harsh in the extreme; it is bad economics because all the research indicates if workers are given treatment quickly they are more likely to recover and rehabilitate themselves. The Australian parliament has a legitimate interest in ensuring that workers are assisted in their medical treatment and get back to not only a healthy family environment but also being productive members of the community as soon as possible. The member for Boothby may doubt that the Australian parliament has the power, but the health insurance funds are on notice that, if they cannot get together on a code, the Australian parliament will do something about it-if not under this government, certainly in 12 months time when, as the opinion polls suggest, the government changes. Workers have a real and legitimate interest in receiving appropriate medical care. Often, if a worker has not undergone surgery to repair the damage, his case cannot be resolved because the very nature of a damages action is that once-and-for-all compensation is being given to that worker for the past and for the future. The member spent a considerable amount of his time talking about the health insurance rebate. I thought he was going to take that angle. The fact of the matter is that $1.7 billion is being spent by this government to induce people to enter private health funds. That is about $50,000 per new member. It has been a dramatic failure. At the same time, $800 million has been taken out of the public health system-again delaying the amount of time an injured person has before they can get appropriate treatment. There is a theoretical risk of double dipping, but already the Health Insurance Commission is able to place a charge on any compensation outcome. That charge remains until the lawyer, or whoever the person is, clarifies the terms of the settlement and ensures that the charge is paid back to the Health Insurance Commission. It wou1d be a very simple thing for the private health funds to do. The honourable member also mentioned the possibility of sweetheart deals where medical expenses were quarantined out of the terms of settlement. Again, it is relatively easy to deem part of a settlement as representing the medical expenses determined on the basis of the expenses actually charged. So that is a false and simplistic fear, manufacby tured by the health insurance funds. When you offset that fear against the devastation caused to workers and their families it does not measure at all on the scale. The honourable member is saying that the private health funds act as a bank, effectively, to loan money to the workers. If that is right, so be it. But they are doing much more than that because if the worker or injured person had decided not to pursue the claim they would be obliged to pay the medical bills. Because the worker or injured person elects to pursue the claim, they are saying, 'We are out of this; you are on your own, brother.' In fact, the worker is doing them a favour by pursuing another source of liability. If they are too silly to realise that and get together and work out a code such that they are prepared to honour the thrust and the substance of their contractual obligations, they are on notice that they will ultimately have legislation forced upon them. One might speculate that the reason people are leaving private health insurers is that the funds are not demonstrating good faith in regard to the extent of benefits people think they have contracted for. (Time expired)",27
34,Mrs STONE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"As all of the previous speakers have said, this is a very serious issue and one that occurs, tragically, not uncommonly around Australia where someone has an accident, their ability to work or to be a carer in the home is impaired and they face huge medical costs. If they have been privately insured they often discover to their regret, as Mr Vercoe did, that they had not read the small print in their insurers policy documentation. How did we get to this situation where private health insurance companies do not automatically continue to pay while they have one of their clients in the process of trying gain compensation through the courts? It is all to do with circumstances that have gone or for a very long time. Part of this problem is that it has been quite common in very long and protected court hearings leading to, eventually, quite large pay-outs that often the decision has made no reference for the claimant to refund any moneys that have been paid the fund during the compensation process. The payouts have tended to relate to pain and suffering and future medical expenses. Hence the funds, not surprisingly, have found themselves out of pocket. It is very difficult sometimes too for the claimant, who is finally paid not in a lump sum but in a series of, say, weekly payments, to accumulate the funds to pay back the sum that the private insurance company may have paid to them during the period they were seeking compensation. So this is a very difficult situation. It is also difficult because it is very firmly in the private sector, where commercial undertakings are negotiated between someone who wants to buy a service, in this case insurance, and someone who is prepared to sell that service. As well, it belongs in the state's jurisdiction. Determination of compensable status and management of compensation schemes is a state government responsibility. Also, generally the injured person is processed through the public hospital system. I am sure that the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) is concerned that state public hospitals often charge compensable patients considerably higher-around $400 per day compared to a health insured patient at $213 per day. So, as you can see, there are all sorts of expectations built into the system that there will be some sort of reaping of benefits at the end of the day with this compensation payment. It is extraordinarily difficult for a government to talk about forcing a private sector provider of services to do anything in terms of clients when a contract between the two has been drawn up which clearly states that there are certain circumstances where payments will not be made. It is a very difficult situation. When the pain and suffering is to being felt the person feels that they should be covered. I believe that what we have to do is what we are currently doing now with the Australian population at large. We are saying to them: 'For heaven's sake, before you go and have any procedures, for example in a hospital, negotiate, talk to the doctors and the anaesthetists, to the various health service providers and to the private hospital itself ask what all of the various services are going to cost you. Ask how many procedures you are going to have. Ask whether there is going to be a gap between what you are insured for and what the various service providers are going to charge you.' We have to have an informed public when it comes to medical services costs in this country. Without an informed public, we end up having situations like Mr Vercoe found himself in. He had a contract. He did not understand that contract. After he was injured he felt poorly done by. This is a serious and complex matter. It is a case where we have to ask the insurance companies to make much greater effort in explaining exactly what they are prepared to do with their clients. We have to expect people seeking insurance in these areas in the future to shop around.",28

36,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Batman)The Howard government is a government which likes to put off till tomorrow that which it should do today. It is a government which keeps promising what it will do for the unemployed but keeps putting off the only solution, which includes higher economic growth and real jobs programs. I was not surprised to hear today that the key line in as for the newly renamed CES, to be called-wait for it-Employment Australia, is 'The future starts in May' - not today but 'The future starts in May'. What happens to the 800,000 unemployed in December, January, February, March and April if 'The future starts in May'? What happens to the 256,100 long-term unemployed in December, January, February, March and April if 'The future starts in May'? These 800,000 unemand ployed and the 256,100 long-term unemployed are looking for jobs today, not in May. Employment Australia was launched yesterday but, if you look at the media today, you will see there is almost not a line because the media know this government will do nothing. It is a do-nothing government which likes to put off till tomorrow that which it should do today. 'The future starts in May'-that is what this government is saying about the unemployed. No commitment to jobs todayyou have got to wait till May. No commitment to decent jobs programs today-you hav- got to wait till May. No commitment or hope for workers who are unemployed at Christmas and their families-you have got to wait till May. No concern for those communities of regional Australia-you have got to wait till May. (Time expired) Small Business",29
37,Mr BARTLETT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last weekend I spent time talking to small businesses and shopkeepers in my electorate, as I often do. Their comments bear repeating in this place. Firstly, there was an acknowledgment of the benefits of some of the government's policies, which are really beginning to help them. These included lower interest rates, changes to FBT, capital gains tax relief and industrial relations reform. They were also very pleased with the 'Fair Go for Small Business' package, which will be a valuable step in protecting small businesses, such as retailers and franchisees, from unfair conduct by larger operators. Also interesting was the comment that they are feeling more secure, knowing that the government is really getting a handle on the country's debt problems. The comment was quite rightly made by one shopkeeper, 'If we hadn't been seriously addressing government debt and national debt, the Asian currency crisis would have hit us much more severely.' It was encouraging to see that this government's responsible management is bringing a sense of security to our small business community. In contrast to these positive comments, two main areas of concern were expressed. One was the need for tax reform. 'The current tax system is unfair and unworkable and the wholesale sales tax system is a mess,' I was told. The second was the need for progress on unfair dismissal laws. 'It is not worth the of putting someone on under the current laws,' was the message from one shopkeeper. 'Tell the Senate to stop obstructing this legislation. Tell them to get out of the way so that small business can do something about hiring people.' That was the clear message I received. This government has done far more for small business in 18 months than the former mob ever thought of doing in 13 years. It is a pity their current obstructionism is still proving to be a barrier to small business growth and employment. (Time expired) Whittam Government: 25th Anniversary",29
38,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last Saturday night at the Revesby Workers' Club in Sydney, Joy and I had the privilege, with hundreds of others, of celebrating with Gough and Margaret Whitlam the 25th anniversary of that defining moment in Australia's history when Australians purged their guilt over the 23 years of conservative coalition federal government in Australia and elected a Labor government led by one of Australia's greatest sons and visionaries, Edward GoughWhitlam. The motives of those who have tried and still try to discredit that government are well understood by us. They are the people who fear and resist any changes which involve active government and a role for the public sector in redressing injustice, in righting wrongs and in helping the nation to look forward from what is tq what can be. They are afraid of and resist any thoughts or deeds which may threaten the supremacy or the privileges of those they really represent. Gough Whitlam helped to inspire Australians with his vision of what might be, and he still does. Over the past 25 years he has strengthened and refined those ideals. The thousands of people who give him standing ovations wherever he goes applaud his ideals, his vision, his courage, his persistence and his profound and continuing achievements.

Southern Cross Village",30
40,Mr MOSSFIELD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to refer to some good news relating to nursing homes. On Saturday, my wife, Jan, and' I attended the official opening of St Francis Apartments in the Southern Cross Village at Plumpton in western Sydney. The official opening was performed by the Reverend Kevin Manning, Bishop of Parramatta. Southern Cross Village, Plumpton, is one of 12 lifestyle villages especially designed for people over 60. The opening of these apartments, which is stage one of the village, represents a long standing dream. In 1970 Southern Cross Homes acquired the property for the purpose of building a retirement village. Due to a number of drawbacks, little progress took place unti11994 when a new feasibility study was carried out which convinced the then Labor government to allocate funding towards the establishment of these apartments. St Francis Apartments cost $4.705 million, of which the federal government contributed $1.512 million. In spite of the significant shortfall in funding, Southern Cross Homes is committed to its entry policy, which is based solely on the needs of older persons. Work has already begun on planning for independent living units. Ultimately, the Village. will comprise the apartments and approximately 70 units. I congratulate Southern Cross Homes for the work they are doing in providing much-needed accommodation for the older citizens of western Sydney. A.i. Scientific",30

Known as the Pathfinder, their robotics system will substantially increase efficiency and safety in patholof ogy. The company has established subsidiaries in New Zealand and the USA, and the worldclass design of Ai. Scientific's products sees the export of over 95 per cent of their output to markets in Asia, Europe and North America-a truly great achievement. The Chief Executive Officer of the company, Mr Stephen Pronk, said at the celebration that he has been delighted at the ability of the government to match the vision of Ai. Scientific and to provide further incentives to achieve. The company received funding through the industry innovation program to work with the Industry, Research and Development Board and the Mater Hospital. Mr Pronk also added that the support of local suppliers in south-east Queensland has played an important part in their success over the last 10 years. I was extremely pleased to be able to unveil the Pathfinder and firmly believe that Ai. Scientific is a prime example of the ability of business to thrive, with this government's support, particularly through the industry innovation program. (Time expired) Service Clubs",31
42,Mr FITZGIBBON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"One cannot overstate the value of the work of those who commit their time freely to make their communities better places in which to live. Over the past fortnight I have attended two very important community service club functions in my electorate. The first was a dinner held to mark the 60th anniversary of Cessnock Rotary. The second was the 1,OOOth dinner of the Cessnock Apex Club. Both clubs have a very rich and proud history, and it would be impossible to accurately quantify the number of service hours past and present members have so generously given. Nor would it be easy to calculate the total amount of money they have raised and forwarded on to deserving charities over their combined 100 years. The President of Cessnock Rotary Club is Mr David Cleaves. The President of Cessnock Apex Club is Mr Michael Cleaves, son of David. Along with young Ben Cleaves, the Cleaves boys are making a significant contribution to their local community. The example had already been set by David's brother, Mr John Cleaves, who was International President Apex and was honoured with life governorship of the Association of Apex Clubs. Before them, John and David's father, Mr Bill Cleaves, was very active in Cessnock Lions and in the Cessnock Chamber of Commerce. One of the highlights of the APEX dinner was the special award presented to life member Bob Bedford, whose contribution to the organisation over many years has been absolutely amazing. I am confident that all members will join with me in extending congratulations and thanks to Cessnock Rotary and Cessnock Apex, and all those who serve in Apex, Rotary, Lions and like organisations. Perth Airport",31
43,Mr RANDALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I am delighted to announce that the residents in areas affected by airport noise will be considered for compensation under a plan I am working on with Perth Airport and the Howard government. Westralia Airports Corporation, the ownermanagers of Perth's domestic and international airport operations, are soon to make public their management plan, which will include a study of noise exposure contours. On the basis of these findings, certain homes may become eligible for compensation, whether by way of insulation and/or double glazing at their residences or through an acquisition program. I have received numerous complaints and comments from residents affected by the Perth airport, whether it is noise, cracked ceilings or something else, and I have always wished I could be in a position to help them. I have had discussions with the Federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) and with Westralia Airports Corporation about my plans, and they have been very positive. When the Howard government was elected last year, the Labor Party immediately began claiming that I had played a part in a decision to scrap a noise amelioration or compensation package. This was untrue, and they knew it. Before this government was elected, there was simply no plan for such a package, and there was not even any money earmarked for such a package. There was nothing to scrap. Unfortunately, because of the horrendous state of the books when the Howard governmen t took over from the former Labor government-Australia was in debt to the tune of $11 billion-we were not in a position to immediately implement a suitable package because it could not be funded. Now that this government is looking to being in surplus after sound economic management, at the next budget we will be in a far better position to consider such proposals for noise amelioration programs at the Perth airport. Pig Meat",31
44,Ms HANSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I must protest at the unlimited importation of cooked and uncooked pig meat from Canada and Denmark. Our farmers cannot export meat to these countries, as Denmark maintains a tariff of up to $3,500 per tonne and Canada's protection to the farm gate value of production is four times that of Australia. Under World Trade Organisation rules, the government can apply a tariff to Canadian cooked pig meat, but they do not. Can the government explain where the level playing field is in this case? To add insult to injury, these foreigners not be paying the Australian slaughter fee, so foreign meat will also benefit from free promotion. The real threat of importing pig diseases cannot be dismissed as acceptable risk. Once Australia is infected, the disease is here forever. That is not an acceptable risk. Last year Queensland producers were getting $2.70 a kilo. Now prices have been cut to $2.10 a kilo. But is pork cheaper? Have these savings been passed on to Australian consumers? As usual, the answer is no. And what of profits? Instead of going to Australian farmers, they will now be going overseas. The president of the Queensland pork producers organisation made it clear that pork producers are all suffering financial hardship. Our farmers cannot compete with subsidised imports, and pork producers are the latest victims in this war called free trade. How many more of these farmers and their families will be forced off the land and onto the dole while the government pursues its policy of sacrificing Australian industries? (Time expired) Native Title  this debate I have an opportunity to put on the record my dismay at an article that was published in the Adelaide Advertiser this morning which quotes Noel Pearson, who has become very famous in recent months, on the subject of the government's Wik legislation. I was very unhappy to see that he was likening the Wik legislation and this government's attitude on Aboriginal rights to poison in a waterhole. He also said that this federal government basically despises black people. I would like to put it on record that I find those comments utterly offensive. We all know what it means to put poison in a waterc hole. We know that people who were responsible for doing that were common murderers who killed many Aboriginal people last century. To have our legislation likened to murderous, barbarous acts of settlers is a  and his cause no credit by lowering himself to that level, so damaging any opportunities we might have in Australia for genuine reconciliation. I for one am not part of a will government that despises black people; I am part of a government that is trying to get a fair and equitable response to a very difficult issue. Domestic Violence",32
45,Mr OKEEFE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,I take the remaining seconds of this debate to commend to the House this kit that was prepared by the Loddon-Mallee Women's Health Unit to assist the Office of the Status of Women in matters to do with domestic violence. A whole lot of useful information has been prepared on behalf of country women. I commend them for the work they have done.,32

48,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer to government suggestions last week that Australian backyards could be subject to native title claims. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Native Title Tribunal will not accept claims over freehold land and your own law firm, Clayton Utz, has said that it is clear that suburban backyards cannot be claimed? Prime Minister, why didn't you take the opportunity last night to reassure the Australian people that their homes are safe?",33
49,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The real point at issue in this is not the question of backyards which, incidentally, was raised by the Leader of the Opposition but this: why does the Labor Party want to destroy a clause in the legislation will confirm that native title claims cannot be made on freehold, cannot be made on agricultural leases and cannot be made on other grants that involve the conferring of exclusive possession? There is no scaremongering by the members of the government. References to backyards and references to scaremongering are the words of the Labor Party. I have read very carefully what Senator Minchin said. What Senator Minchin said was a straight statement of fact. I want the Australian Labor Party to explain to the Australian people: why are you trying to destroy a clause that will confirm the safety of freehold?",33

57,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. I noted over the weekend a comment from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who said: There. is a live legal question about whether native title could exist or revive on public freehold land. These amendments which the Labor Party is pushing are indeed very complex and deserve now absolute scrutiny. The state and territory governments would face an impossible administrative task if they are required to identify every individual action undertaken on every that pastoral lease since 1 January 1994 in the four-month period which you are proposing to allow under your Labor amendments. Failure by a state or territory government to gazette an act as simple as construction of a new bore or a conservation drain, or even the extension of a future building, would mean that such action could be invalid and farmers could be sued for having done such workof",33

59,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You might think it is a laughing matter-I don't for one moment. Mr Crean-We think that you are.,34
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham.,34
61,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a very serious and complex situation. Labor's proposals with these amendments are contrary to the Wik decision and the post-script which said-and I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of this-that the rights of the pastoral leaseLabor holders prevail; they are in the ascendancy over the native title claimant. So the government's bill would provide very sensible validation on this point. If, indeed, there. to be subsequent notification and a requiresals ment for compensation, they are provided elsewhere in the legislation. I want to put a challenge to the Leader of the Opposition today: that he use his 10 minutes wisely tomember night when he goes to record his remarks, and announces his withdrawal of his amendments which delete schedule 4, which provides a very conservative confirmation of native title over a group of leases, including leases where we believe there has been intended exclusive possession. So the challenge is on the Leader of the Opposition to alter his amendments, which are divisive, which will create great uncertainty in the bush, which are demonstraand bly unfair and which will be seen as that by ers. all fair-minded Australians, especially after the excellent address by the Prime Minister last night. Native Title",34
62,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But we will make the bill constitutional.,34
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You will move quickly to resource your question.,34
64,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, last night you said that the government has advice that its plan is legal, but isn't it a fact that you have had legal advice since July that lO-point plan is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Form.s Racial Discrimination? Why didn't you tell the Australian public about that last night? Will you now release your legal advice?",34
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I understand that a lot of questions were asked on this of both Senator Minchin and the Attorney-General. I refer the honourable gentleman to those; and I have nothing to add. Native Title,34
66,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Is the minister aware that proposed amendments to the government's native ,title bill will not allow state and territory governments to give legal certainty to many titles for major mining and resource projects? were What are the implications of Labor's propofor the Australian economy and the for mining industry in particular?",34
67,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable for his question. It is a very important one. The fact of the matter is that this parliament and the nation have an unprecedented opportunity to re-establish certainty and goodwill among those living and working in non-metropolitan Australia, and we ought to take it. The lO-point plan and the current bill based on it represent the correct balance between competing interests of parties, including Aboriginal people, those in the mining resource sectors, and our primary producBut Labor is proposing amendments to this bill which would specifically prevent state and territory governments from validating any resource project approved after 1 January 1994 under special enabling legislation known as a state agreement act or an indenture act. These acts are used to facilitate large-scale projects, where it just happens that certainty of title is of major and very understandable concern to developers who are investing billions of dollars in this country. Labor's proposed validation provision would create major uncertainty for titles issued over your the past few years for several major mining and resource development projects, particularly, as it happens, in Western Australia and in Queensland under the special states legislation. They are talking here about many, many thousands of jobs-jobs where they are needed most of all in this country, in our remote and regional areas. We are dealing with a minerals sector which has a track record of backing its optimism with investment and with job opportunities. It needs to be noted that we are not talking purely about minerals when it comes to that; the uncertainty would also spread to domestic gas projects, which in turn will help significantly to address greenhouse issues in the future. The bottom line issue is straightforward. Under Labor's amendments, ti tIes for these projects could not be validated and developers would be forced to negotiate agreements with native title holders on a retrospective basis the case of those investments already under way or operational, which would be an extraordinary and unworkable situation. Even if such agreements were to go ahead, project proponents would find that they still did not have certainty because, fundamentally, legal validity cannot be provided by an agreement. So, in net terms, what do Labor's amendments give us? Even more uncertainty, fewer jobs and a downgrading of much needed export income. As my colleague, the Minister for Resources and Energy, has made quite clear, mining companies will always seek to reach a negotiated settlement with any holder of a valid title over which exploration or mining titles are sought. This makes it all the more important for us to have a native title system which works in the real world and which has an effective registration test which ensures that only credible claimants gain the right to negotiate. The fact is that Labor is offering a native title legacy of confusion, delay and lost opportunities-frustrating to all parties. For both social and economic reasons, especially in rural and remote Australia, certainty ought to be re-established now. NA",34
68,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the Koiari Development Authority from Papua New Guinea.

70,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. It refers to his words last night when he declared his 'fulsome commitment' to reconciliation with indigenin ous Australians. Prime Minister, how should your use of the word 'fulsome' be interpreted: in accordance with The Macquarie Dictionary as 'gushing and insincere'? Or the Heinemann dictionary as 'excessive in an insincere way'? Or the Collins dictionary as 'excessive or insincere, especially in an offensive or distasteful way'? Alternatively, should the Australian public simply recall the Prime Minister's lectern thumping speech to the national reconciliation conference last May?",35
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is not required to respond to the question. It is couched in the ironic and is therefore out of order. Small Business,35
72,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, as you would be aware small business is the backbone of the local economy in my electorate of Deakin. Are you aware of any recent data about the current trading conditions being encountered by Australian small businesses? Can you also inform the House of the impact employment disincentives, such as unfair dismissal laws, are having on this sector of the economy? How do small business trading conditions compare now with when the coalition assumed office in March 1996?",35
73,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question. The member for Deakin has a lot of experience in small business and that is a good thing because represents an electorate where there are fine and innovative small businesses. I comactivity pliment him on the great work he does as a representative for small business in this parliament. There is some very good news around for small business. That is not to say that some people in small business have not done it tough-of course they have. There are businesses that still feel the aftershock of Labor's depression/recession back in the early 1990s. At the same time, there' are some small businesses that are really starting to pick and they are starting to build their confidence. That is a good thing because, as confidence grows, it spreads around the small business community. I think that, given the leadership that this government has shown and the improved circumstances for small business that we have introduced, they have good reason to have that greater sense of confiLabor dence. Last week the Yellow Pages index out, with some excellent news for the small business community. It showed that sales growth in small business has been the highest since small business came out of Labor's recession in 1994. It showed that profit growth was up, as well as sales growth. That is good news for the small business communinet ty. It also showed that small business $217 proprietors' confidence has been at its highest level for 2Y2 years-another reflection of the good and strong policy initiatives that this government has introduced for the benefit the small business comn'mnity. Given that survey was conducted in the week of the Asian stock market falls earlier this month, shows you doubly that there is a lot of very foreign debt? positive news there for the small business community. We have also had out today-I know people on our side will be interested in thisanother positive set of indicators for this",35
74,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,36
75,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Everybody is happy. Seeing we as the Treasurer is away, I think I should this: everybody is happy to hear good news except a few over to my left here. The ACCI billion. National Survey of Business Expectations he released today covers the December quarter many and it shows strong signs that economic is on the rise, particularly in general business conditions, sales, exports and investment. Good news. The trends are positive. Sure, they are a bit better for the bigger businesses, but that is a benefit right through the business community and confirms those statements from the small business survey. In conclusion, the one soft spot in the Yellow Pages figure was about employment. The importance for all of us to note from that is that we do need to do more to assist small up business to give somebody a job. The thing that you can do is to vote for and support our exemption for small business from the unfair dismissal law. Labor is opposed to it. Today the Small Business Forum is meeting in Canberra and one of the strongest messages coming out of that representative body of small business is that it is about time the Party in the Senate and the Democrats stopped ganging up against small business came and supported our sensible measure. Foreign Debt",36
76,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Acting Treasurer. WiIl you confirm that today's figures show Australia's foreign debt at an all-time record high of billion, having risen by a massive $24.4 billion in your first 18 months in office? Can you confirm that this means that foreign debt is growing under your government at almost of twice the rate it did in Labor's last term? the How does this massive rise in foreign debt compare with your debt truck promise in the it last election not to increase but to reduce",36
77,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The last thing I thought I would get in the way of a question from the opposition was a question on debt, particularly from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The opposition when in government made an art form of increasing growing debt and, as have heard in this House so often, general say government debt increased in the last five years under Labor from $16 billion to $93 Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: my question was about foreign debt. If the Acting Treasurer does not understand the difference, he is in the wrong job.",36
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,37
79,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Clearly the opposition does not want to hear the word 'debt' when it comes to its record on debt. On any occasion, it does not want to hear about its record on debt. As my colleague the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business just said, today's figures on the balance of payments indicate in trend terms a very favourable indication of just where the economy is going. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition really wants to understand what the economy is about at the present time, I would like to him to the release that was put out today by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This indicates the state of the econlook omy. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I implore you to contemplate your responsibilities as a fair-minded and impartial Speaker to apply the rule about relevance in a proper way. Relevance? ACC!?",37
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are treading on very dangerous ground. Mr Gareth Evans-Relevance? Relevance? ACCI?,37
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Remember what happened here last week.,37
82,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Of course the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has grave concerns about relevance and has expressed before what his relationship with relevance is. I think all honourable members of the House would like to know what someone outside government has to say about the economy. Mr Gareth Evans-And foreign debt?,37
83,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know the members on this side would very much appreciate hearing it, and I will come back to your debt in a minute. Today's media release from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says: The Australian economy is now well on its way to recovery. It goes on to say: The latest survey results show an improvement in general business conditions, sales, exports, employment, and business investment. The results also show further moderation in wage outcomes and no evidence of inflationary pressures. But it gets better: These results provide confirmation that the actions taken by the Government to lower the deficit through cuts to expenditure are paying dividends. Rather than slowing activity, these structural shifts have improved our economic fundamentals and restored competitiveness. They have given the economy an underlying strength it has not had for many years. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition can take come in here and throw some figures about. If you want to look at your debt, have a look at it in terms of percentage of GDP. Have a at it in those terms. And, if you want to look at foreign debt and see what has occurred, the biggest single contributor to foreign debt in recent years has been the efforts of that lot over there when they were in government by increasiI1g general government debt. Each month the debt goes out paying those loans brought in from overseas. Quite clearly what this government has done-by reducing the cost of government, by selling assets and retiring debt-is to make a significant contribution to our debt. As I have indicated very clearly, as a percentage of GDP, it is far below that which Labor left us-the debt and deficit syndrome in which we have spent the last two years. Government Business Enterprises",37
84,Mr ROSS CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Can the minister inform the House of the government's policy in relation to the sale of government business enterprises?,37
85,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parramatta. How timely it is that he should ask such a question when the Labor Party just had the cheek to ask us a question about debt. They are the world champions of creating debt. Nothing could better demonstrate their expertise at gross financial incompetence than the saga of ANL. It must be imprinted on the mind-what is left of it-of the Leader of the Opposition and his sidekick the member for Kingsford-Smith. ANL is one of the greatest sagas of financial bumbling incompetence run by the trade union and by a weak and hopeless government that you will ever see in the history of this country. That is no mere exaggeration, Mr Speaker. I have been reading the saga of ANL. I would like to take the House all the way back over the 13 years",37
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Go on. I'll give you an extension of time.,38
87,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If I had the extension of time, a couple of hours would just see us through the first couple of years. But I should remind members of just a few events from 1994, during the dying throes of the previous government. March 1994: do you remember that, Laurie? That was when you announced your sale of ANL. Do you remember June 1994: the factional infighting-'Shall we or shall we not sell ANL?'-and unions threatening industrial action? Then on 22 August 1994 there were these great immortal words il, the incompetent management of the previous government, the words of the member for Kingsford-Smith: 'You couldn't give it away; that's the reality.' Four months earlier he had announced its sale. Four months later 'you could not give it away'. Then what did he do? The board of ANL had to walk the plank. They walked the plank and in walked the Labor cronies to take out $820,000, thank you very much. Their job was to sell ANL. A wry smile appears on the Leader of the Opposition's face. It should be a smile of gross embarrassment. Then we had a national waterfront stoppage-remember that one-in September 1994. Then on 15 September 1994 a wonderful package was announced! The brotherhood had come to a deal. The deal was that the MUA would buy ANL using superannuation funds. Let us remember that it would have been only three weeks earlier that the member for Kingsford-Smith had announced to all that 'you could not give it away; that's the reality'. He was going to sell it to the MUA. By Christmas that deal was off. What is happening in February 1995? They have announced yet again that they are going to sell ANL. There are protracted negotiations with P&O and there are threats by the ACTU, the MUA and whoever you like of another national strike. In December 1995 the sale is dead again. It ill behoves the Labor Party to ask questions about debt. You have racked up a massive debt in ANL and left us with a mess to clean up. I pay tribute to the member for Hume and the work that he has done. We have put this asset back into a condition where it is an asset which is attractive for sale. We have started the process. As with many of these things, it took a change in government and a real determination to start to fix up the mess we were left by the Labor Party. Nursing Homes",38
88,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by the Minister for Family Services' claims to him that nursing home providers agree with a further review of their capital needs and having these addressed in the longer term after next year's budget? Is the Prime Minister aware that this contradicts views directly expressed to the minister in the last fortnight and again today by the major private and not for profit aged care providers? Didn't the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals say today they 'did not agree to any further inquiry' and that 'our major concern would be that any settlement of the issue could be taken beyond the budget'? Prime Minister, when will you provide certainty for older Australians, backdown completely and restore the cuts made by your government to nursing homes?",38
89,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a question from one of the great nursing home slashers of all time, and there was the way you ran down the capital contribution in the last years that you were in office. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the Minister for Family Services is in fact making a statement about this matter today. As always, I would counsel him not to believe everything he reads in the papers. World AIDS Day",38
90,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. With Australia's effort on HIV-AIDS having been commended by such bodies as the United Nations and the World Health Organisation, could the minister please outline to the House the significance that World AIDS Day has to the people of Australia and what work the government is doing in research, treatment and education programs that will ensure the low rate of incidence of HIV-AIDS in this country is sustained?",39
91,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Today is World AIDS Day. The member for Bradfield earlier today stood in for me in the Great Hall, where he launched a play, No prejudice, from the Kimberley Aboriginal medical service. The member for Bradfield very courageously told the audience there how his own brother had died of AIDS, and I think it reinforces the fact that AIDS does not respect class and it does not respect race; it is something that can potentially affect all families. Australia's response to HIV is one that could be best described as one of enlightened pragmatism, and it has been successful. We have had 20,706 infections known to us so far. But our rate of infection has dropped dramatically from a peak of 3,000 infections a year in 1983, at the beginning of the epidemic, to 500 infections a year in 1997. The cornerstone of our response has been a partnership between affected communities and governments at all levels. But we need to recognise that Australia is and always will be part of a worldwide epidemic. So this year we have adopted the UN theme for World AIDS Day, children living in a world with AIDS. Each day worldwide at least 1,000 children contract HIV. In 1996, at best estimate, 350,000 children died of HIV. The honourable member asked about education, treatments and research. The education strategy we pursue puts about $2 million a year into education and, according to the third strategy, focuses on the three groups most at risk: homosexually active men, IV drug users and indigenous people. In terms of treatments, there has been very good news in the last two years. We are now using combination therapies and new therapies, and most would believe that a very dramatic drop in deaths is due to these treatments. Of course, they are no magic cure. They do not eliminate the virus from the body altogether. They just reduce the virus to a rate where the body can live with it. Some people do develop a tolerance to the drugs and they no longer work, but they do give reason for optimism. On the issue of research, Australia is amongst the world leaders on HIV research. We fund a centre for epidemiology and clinical research. We fund a HIV virology centre. We fund a centre for HIV social research, as well as having specific HIV research grants. It is often put to me that we spend too much on HIV and not on other areas of research. To that I would say that there are several reasons for doing this. Firstly, HIV is a new disease that is teaching us a lot of new things about virology. We now have over 12 anti-retroviral drugs. We had virtually none 12 years ago. These dru-s will have substantial spin-offs into other areas of health. Secondly, HIV is a communicable disease which, unlike cancer, can spread to one who can spread it to 100 who can spread it to to,OOO. Finally, we do not fund research on an illness basis. We fund research on the basis of where we have expertise. Australia clearly has expertise in an area such as immunology. We fund that at a far higher level than we would if we were merely dividing it up between individual diseases-similarly, with HIV. Australia's response is one that we can be proud of. It is one that all members of this House can be proud of because it is one that has been successful and that has been forged over 12 years through a bipartisan approach and enlightened pragmatism. Nursing Homes",39
92,Mr WILTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Has the minister seen a report in The Comet, the. newsletter of the Queensland pensioners and superannuants, where it states that: Residents homes will still be regarded as an for entry into a nursing home. Can the minister confirm that the family home is still part of the assets test for paying the accommodation charge?",39
93,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the member for Isaacs, I ask him a question: are you aware that for 10 years the home was part of the assets assessment for the charge that was made for entry into hostels? How ironic! Here you are standing up with confected indignation about the assets test in relation to accommodation charges to nursing homes. The family home will be safe under the Liberal Party with regard to charges that are paid. I will be announcing the assessments later in the day. Helicopter Training School, Oakey",40
94,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. The minister will be aware of a groundbreaking ceremony at the Army Aviation Centre, Oakey, in my electorate last Friday by the Singaporean chief of the air force for a $30 miIlion helicopter training facility. Can the minister inform the House what this initiative means for bilateral defence cooperation, for local commercial support and for the social and economic impact on southeast Queensland?",40
95,Mr MCLA CHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Groom for his question. He is always a lively contributor to the defence debate. It was very pleasing to see that that helicopter training school was opened at Oakey over the weekend. That will include 12 Super Puma helicopters, and follows from the fine training school at Pearce in Western Australia and the ever increasing use of Shoal water Bay by the Singaporean army. It is perfectly obvious that Singapore does not have the space for these training needs, and the defence cooperation between Australia and Singapore makes that increasingly possible for them. The estimates that I have suggest that the economic benefits to Australia from major construction should have a benefit of somewhere between $20 and $25 million or a little more. I understand that contracts for the earthworks have already been let, as have some electrical contracts. In asset addition, there will be a commercial support contract covering matters such as maintenance and repair. The local community will benefit from the long-term presence in the area of Singaporean personnel and their families. Tomorrow I will be making a statement on Australia's strategic policy, one theme of which will be the inextricable link between Australia's security and the security of our region and our regional neighbours. Foreign Debt",40
96,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question follows the question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Will the Acting Treasurer confirm that domestic Commonwealth borrowings reduce the funds available in Australia to the private sector, given that the private sector then has to borrow overseas? Will reduced Commonwealth debt and borrowings therefore allow a commensurate drop in overseas debt?",40
97,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To come directly to the honourable member's question, clearly, that is the aim of the government. This government has set about repairing the fiscal damage that was caused by Labor. That task was undertaken in a manner which cut the cost of government, reduced the expenditure of government, reduced the cost of borrowing money through interest rates which have gone down 2.5 percentage points over the past year or so, and lowered inflation. In the course of doing that, I am sure the honourable member would be aware that we have actually increased the national savings. We have increased the national savings because the call on borrowings by the Commonwealth has reduced. We have increased national savings in a manner which allows funds to be available as a result for borrowings here by the private sector. That is where the honourable member was coming from in asking his question. Quite clearly, we are about reducing debt in this country. There is ample evidence that that has occurred, and we will continue to bear down on it in all that we do. That, of course, will create that fund here to allow for private borrowings by the private sector. Green Corps Environmental Schemes",40
98,Mr TONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I preface my question to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs by saying that the minister may be aware of the enthusiasm demonstrated by young people in my electorate of Dickson towards the Green Corps initiative that is providing opportunities for young Australians to assist in building Australia's environmental infrastructure by applying their labour skills to environmental projects. Mr Crean-Oh, Mr Speaker! Okay, that is setting a standard for questions. Mr Downer-You could never set a standard!",41
99,Mr TONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the mmlster inform the House of the achievements of the Green Corps program now that the first round of participants has graduated?,41
100,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dickson for his question. Green Corps is the government's $42 million youth environment initiative, which over three years is providing some three and a half thousand young Australians with accredited training and hands-on work experience in important local and regional environmental schemes. This is something that the Labor Party never did. There is great enthusiasm, as the member for Dickson says, amongst young people for the Green Corps. Only the Labor Party is unhappy about the Green Corps, because it is successful. The view of the member for Batman was that the Green Corps is a con. The man committed to dragging Australia back to Working Nation and demoralising training programs despises the program that hundreds of young Australians are delighted to be a part of. The Green Corps is undertaking a number of very important and valuable projects. For example, one of the projects is greening the transport corridors linking Sydney's various Olympic sites to ensure that Australia presents its best face to the world when we host the Year 2000 Olympic Games. In the first round of Green Corps projects, the outcomes achieved have been of high quality. I inform the House that the first teams have planted 175,000 native trees. They have built 40 kilometres of tracks, including six bridges. They have rehabilitated six kilometres of coastline and 12 kilometres of rivers, and have restored 1,000 hectares of sand dunes. Of the 240 participants in these first Green Corps teams, nearly 200, or 81 per cent, have declared that they will undertake accredited education or training to build on the training they have already received. This is evidence of the fact that this government wants to involve young Australians and provide them with the opportunity to rebuild Australia's environment. Of course, the $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust will further express this major objective of this government. All that those on the other side of the House can offer is abuse of this highly effective and popular scheme and tell the Australian people that they want to revive the $10 billion disaster of the failed Working Nation programs. Nursing Homes",41
101,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, in your recent letter to the Prime Minister you say that, even though the government has secretly agreed to a new annual charge for nursing homes of $5,500, 'it would be preferable to leave the cap at $4,380 to avoid raising community concern'. Minister, will you now rule out any further increase in the annual fee for nursing homes?",41
102,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question from the opposition seeks to continue the outrageous scare campaign that has been continued for some period of time and has added to the uncertainty of the elderly in this country. What I can say to you is what I said to you last week and the week before that. On 6 November, after the Prime Minister made his announcements, we announced that the cap would be $4,380, an average fee of $4,000 for an accommodation charge. I can confirm to you that that is the position. Cabinet has confirmed the position and that continues to be the position. Illegal Immigrants",41
103,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. There are reports in today's paper of organised attempts to get people into Australia either illegally, on fraudulent documents, or for non bona fide purposes. Would the minister inform the House whether this is a growing problem for Australia and what the government is doing about it?",42
104,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. The matter is one of very real concern. It is confronting many countries around the world. It is an experience that in Europe and the United States there has been quite considerable evidence of trafficking in human beings as a multi-billion dollar global industry. It appears that we certainly are not immune from what has been happening. The most visible evidence of this has been the illegal arrival of more than 2,900 people by boats since 1989. Many are known to have paid thousands of dollars to come. While some of them were shown to be refugees and received Australia's protection, the great bulk of people certainly have not earned that entitlement. However, the larger and growing problem is the one that people now speak about as the arrival of 'jumbo people'. They are people who come on scheduled flights and often arrive without documentation. If they do have documentation, frequently it is fraudulent, and often they have a non bona fide purpose. To give you some idea of what has happened in 1996-97, 1,350 people have been refused entry at Australian airports. This is an increase of quite a considerable dimension485 in 1994-95; 663 in 1995-96. A third of them came without documentation and one-quarter of them with fraudulent documentation. My department believes that at least 75 per cent of such people have been linked to trafficking operations. We have seen people with elaborate transport plans, people swapping boarding passes in transit lounges, photo substitution in passports as well as use of genuine documents which have been fraudulently obtained. This is a matter of very real concern. We have seen a significant number of visitors who arrive in Australia overstaying or working in contravention of visa conditions. We currently have 45,100 people who have overstayed visas. That does not include those who have made bona fide protection claims or those who are abusing the refugee system to delay their departure. The government is very concerned about the integrity of our boarders. We presently have bills in the other place which will enable us to have a faster and more efficient system for dealing with claims, and a bill dealing with a proposal to eliminate abuse of the judicial review process. Just to give honourable members some idea of what has been happening, in 1989-90 we received eight applications from Filipino citizens for refugee status. This year-199697-we have received 1,740 such applications from the Philippines. I could give many like examples. As I have repeatedly said, if people have bona fide claims, they will be acknowledged and dealt with, but when the system is being abused, as it clearly is, and when people are being encouraged by those who are taking money from them to arrange such entries to Australia, we have a significant problem. It will become more sigl1ificant as we get closer to the Olympics. This is an issue that the government is taking seriously. I hope it is an issue that the opposition will take seriously and will join us in supporting the legislation necessary to give us the power to deal with these problems. Foreign Debt",42
105,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is again directed to the Acting Treasurer. I refer to his assertion earlier in today's question time that foreign debt had fallen as a percentage of GDP since this government has been in office. Is it not the case that foreign debt has increased as a proportion of GDP from 40.1 per cent as at the March 1996 quarter to what today's ABS press release describes as 42.6 per cent in the September 1997 quarter? Will the Acting Treasurer now apologise for misleading the House?,42
106,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think I indicated very clearly earlier to the House that, in terms of debt, the former Labor government made the biggest single contribution to our foreign in the last five years of being in government when they increased general government debt from $16 billion to $93 billion.",43
107,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,In relation to the states?,43
108,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The bulk of that debt increase came from borrowings abroad by the Commonwealth government.,43
109,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Foreign debt was basically stable.,43
110,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Foreign debt is also contributed,43
111,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Foreign debt actually went down in the period you are talking about according to my figures.,43
112,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you just stop yapping for a little while, I will be able to answer the question. Foreign debt is also contributed to by the private sector and by state governments. We have noted just recently that the New South Wales government had a very adventurous process of funding its Mount Piper power station by borrowing from abroad as well. My understanding was that the percentage had decreased in the time of this government compared to the time of the previous government. I have not seen the figures that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has just spoken about. I shall have a look at them. As I indicated earlier, if my percentages are I am sorry, but I shall have a look at them later. Job Placement and Assistance Services",43
113,Ms GAMBARO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Can the minister inform the House of the changes from today of the management of the CES and the launch yesterday of the government's public employment placement enterprise? How will these reforms improve the service for job seekers and employers?",43
114,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. Today marks the start of the most significant reforms in years to improve services for job seekers and employers and get more unemployed people into jobs. For the first time there is now debt competition between the CES and private employment agencies to place people in jobs. It heralds a new era of competition in job placement services for the unemployed. Some $16.2 million of Commonwealth funds have been contracted out to some 300 private and community agencies to find jobs for 65,000 unemployed people over the next five months. From today the CES will be managed by a new government owned enterprise, Employment National. These arrangements are part of the transition to the full employment services market which will come into place on 1 May next year when the Commonwealth will be contracting out $1.7 billion worth of job placement and job assistance services to private, community and public employment agencies. These improved services will provide significant benefits to job seekers, employers and taxpayers. The new competitive services are going to ensure that from today_private job placement agencies will be paid when they place an unemployed person in a job, and only when they place an unemployed person in a job. The focus on jobs will continue from 1 May when all providers will only be paid in full when they place an unemployed person in a job. The incentives will also be targeted to the most disadvantaged job seekers, with the long-term unemployed and out, other disadvantaged groups attracting the highest placement fees. These changes mean that the coalition government can now make a number of commitments to job seekers, to employers and to the community. First, more unemployed people will get jobs, especially the long-term unemployed. There will be many more vacancies available through the system than the 20 per cent of vacancies currently available through the CES. Second, job seekers will never again have to be churned through the kind of short-term training programs which were so characteristic of the Labor Party's Working Nation schemes. Third, assistance will be tailored to the 50 individual jobseeker's needs. The provider will be able to offer each jobseeker precisely the kind of intensive assistance that is required to get them a job-not the inflexible bureaucratic training programs that were characteristic of the Labor Party. Fourth, under a coalition government, taxpayers will no longer have to pay for schemes which cost $143,000 a job and which had a four per cent success rate. The fact is that since the Labor Party failed jobseekers it has been up to this government to put in place the kinds of effective equity programs that will get unemployed people jobs. Literacy Standards",43
115,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. I refer the minister to correspondence from his Victorian colleague Phil Gude proposing that all states and territories refuse to agree to the Commonwealth's benchmarks for school literacy given their lack of consistency and reliability. Minister, how can parents and teachers have confidence in the literacy program if those who run our schools do not have confidence in your benchmarking system? Isn't literacy too important an issue for you to create, in the words of Mr Gude, an 'air of distrust between the states and Commonwealth, thereby destroying an enormous amount of goodwill and cooperati on' ?",44
116,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all they ask about debt and now they ask about literacy. You would think the Labor Party likes to get it on the chin. Let me spell out a few facts of life for the Labor Party. The first thing that needs to be made clear is that they have absolutely no credibility in relation to literacy. Mr Latham- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order point. That is not the question. On relevance, what he is saying is not only a load of rubbish but also irrelevant to the question I have asked. I have asked about the program that he has initiated.",44
117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,44
118,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the member for Sydney clearly said: Quite frankly, wethat is, the Labor Partydid not pay anything like enough attention when in government to the early years of schooling. The evidence is now clear. If problems that emerge in the first few years of schooling with literacy and other basic skills are not identified and effectively addressed, then a vicious cycle sets in which the student falls further behind, becomes demoralised, starts to misbehave and falls further behind. What the government has had to do is, after 13 years of neglect, put in place literacy programs that will finally give these disadvantaged young people a chance in life. Under this government, there has so far been unprecedented cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states. For the first time, there is now a national literacy and numeracy plan. Under this plan the states and territories have agreed to assess every child's literacy and numeracy level at the end of grade 3 and grade 5 against national benchmarks. Progress towards nationally comparable reporting by systems and school authorities was also agreed, to be based on rigorous state based assessment procedures. These agreements are already in place. They are so far beyond anything that was put in place under the previous years of the Labor government that it is only now, for the first time, that parents in this country can be assured their young people will get the literacy skills they need. The literacy benchmarks that the Victorian minister has commented on have been considered by the Curriculum Corporation under the direction of the benchmarking task force and comprises representatives of all the states and territories and the non-government systems. Victoria is on that benchmarking task force, and it has been a party to the entire process. The literacy benchmarks have been developed after extensive consultation with a whole range of expert groups, including those who are key academic students of literacy in this country. These benchmarks will be considered at the MCEETYA meeting to be held on 11 December. I believe that parents in Victoria will be very disappointed if they believe that the Victorian government is seeking to delay the process which will bring educational justice to young people in that state. Mr Gude has unfortunately put himself on the side of lower literacy standards. The Commonwealth is for higher literacy standards. Literacy standards in this country have to be raised. The Commonwealth will be doing everything that is necessary to see that those literacy standards are raised and that the young people disadvantaged by your failure will finally get the chance in life that they deserve. Aircraft Noise: Flight Paths in Sydney",44
119,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. As the minister may be aware, the community in metropolitan Sydney has previously been very angry about unfair flight paths over their homes. Can the minister advise the House what further steps are now being taken to more fairly distribute the aircraft noise associated with Sydney airport?",45
120,Mr V AILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. I think it should be noted that the honourable member for North Sydney has played a very active role in the development of the long-term operating plan for Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney-along with a number of other members in this chamber, not just from the government side. We should acknowledge the work of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, which is chaired by the member for North Sydney, and also the work of members from both sides-the member for Lowe, the member for Wentworth, the member for Cook, the member for Grayndler, the member for Watson, the member for Barton and also the member for Bennelong, all who have an interest in flight paths and aircraft noise Sydney basin. At the last election, the coalition government made a commitment with regard to the operations at Kingsford Smith airport. The first was that we were going to reopen the east-west runway. That was done in very quick order with the 'sharp' work of the honourable member for Hume. We have delivered on that commitment. The second commitment we made was that we were going to more equitably distribute the noise problem in Sydney. This week we are going to deliver on that commitment in full. With the advent of the long-term operating plan, which starts this Thursday, of the Kingsford Smith airport we will see targets set whereby 55 per cent of movements will be to the south over water, 17 per cent of movements will be north, 13 per cent east and 15 per cent west. We should also note the activities that have taken place with regard to the SACF committee, which is chaired by the member for North Sydney, in dealing with that consultative process since the middle of last year until we reached this point. This long-term operating plan with Kingsford Smith airport is not just a plan that has been devised by this government. Ten thousand submissions have been made to Airservices Australia. My department, Airservices Australia, the Sydney Airport Community Forum and the Federal Airports Corporation have all worked together to establish the long term operating plan that will be operating from this Thursday out of Kingsford Smith airport. It is very important to note again the percentages of those movements: 55 per cent to the south, 17 per cent to the north, 13 per cent to the east and 15 per cent to the west. We should compare those with the percentages of flight movements that operated out of KSA .when the last change was made by the previous government, when the member for Kingsford-Smith was the minister responsible. When the parallel operations started under the previous government, 47 per cent of movein the ments were going over the electorate of Grayndler and further on to the north; we saw 51 per cent to the south and we saw one per cent to the west. How many did we see to the east, over the electorate of the member for Kingsford-Smith? One per cent. We saw one per cent under that plan! I will reiterate: as of this Thursday, there will be 55 per cent of movements to the south, 17 per cent of movements to the north, over the electorates of the member for Grayndler, the member for North Sydney and the member for Bennelong; 13 per cent to the east; and 15 per cent to the west. That is a fair share of aircraft noise in Sydney. It is very important that the people of Sydney recognise the fact that this is a community plan developed with community consultation. It is a community airport that generates $8 billion worth of revenue to the Sydney basin and employs many hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly. It has taken a coalition government to establish a fair share of aircraft noise in the Sydney basin.",45
121,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on that very fair and decent note, I not only congratulate the minister but ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Questions on Notice",46
122,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, pursuant to standing order 150, could you write to the relevant ministers in respect of questions 1944 and 1951, first placed on the Notice Paper by me on 24 June?",46
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I would be only too happy to do so. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional,46
124,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the routine of business for Tuesday, 2 December 1997 being as follows, unless otherwise ordered: 1. Notices and orders of the day, government business (to be interrupted at 3 p.m. in order that questions without notice can be called on): Provided that: (a) if a division is in progress at the time fixed for interruption, the division shall be pleted and the result announced; and (b) the Speaker shall fix the time for the resumption of the debate on any business under discussion and not disposed of at the time of interruption. 2. Questions without notice (at 3 p.m.). 3. Presentation of papers. 4. Ministerial statements, by leave. 5. Matter of public importance. 6. Notices and orders of the day, government business. This is simply to provide for arrangements for tomorrow in accordance with the exact same resolution which was before the House on 9 December last year and in accordance with correspondence with the opposition on this matter. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",46
125,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain pensioners, superannuants and retirees points out to the House that Government funding for the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation's national secretariat will cease on 30 September 1997. The Federation provides advice to the Government on older people's needs and concerns, publishes independent information for older people and works to ensure that older people have a say in decisions that affect their lives. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to direct Orders the Government to provide funding to ensure that the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation can continue its valuable work for and with older Australians. by Mr Beazley (from 39 citizens) and Ms Worth (from 19 citizens). Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We the undersigned pensioners and citizens of Australia hereby call upon the Australian Government to cancel the current charges for entry into a com- nursing home by frail aged peoples of Australia. We point out that over many years the Private Nursing Home Industry has distributed large profits to shareholders, neglecting the need to upgrade buildings and facilities. We further call upon the Government to publish the profits of the Private Nursing Home Industry, before tax, over the past five years. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to direct the Government to provide a system that ensures the frail aged Australians be free from the stress and strains of the huge environmental changes of lifestyle in entering a nursing home and the uncertainty of a better quality of life in their twilight years. by Mr Beazley (from 2,802 citizens). Coolangatta Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We the undersigned constituents of the electorate of MCPherson urge the House to: (1) place a high priority on the construction of the Tungun bypass west of Coolangatta Airport on the Gold Coast to ensure its completion before the Year 2000, and to take the lead in arranging joint funding between the NSW, Queensland and Commonwealth Governments; and (2) impose a curfew to ensure no jet aircraft depart from or land at Coolangatta Airport between the hours of 10.00 pm and 6.00 am. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to urge the Federal Government to act urgently upon these matters. by Mr Bradford (from 579 citizens). Coolangatta Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament - We the undersigned constituents of the electorate of MCPherson urge the House to impose a curfew to ensure no jet aircraft depart from or land at Coolangatta Airport between the hours of 10.00 pm and 6.00 am. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to urge the Federal Government to act urgently upon this matter. by Mr Bradford (from 496 citizens). Warrego Highway To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain electors of the Division Longman draws to the attention of the House the many accidents at the Warrego Highway, Gehrke Road and LaidleylPlainland Road intersection of the Warrego Highway at Plainland, Queensland. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House provides funding for the upgrading of this section of the highway. by Mr Brough (from 3,795 citizens). Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of certain residents of Australia notes with concern the impact of the policy of charging entry fees-often necessitating the sale of the family home-for people needing nursing home care. Furthermore, the petitioners note with concern the impact of the policy of charging residents of aged care facilities an extra daily fee which provides no additional benefit to the resident and is nothing more than a disguised Government tax. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of Representatives act to ensure that nursing home care is equally available to all who need it and further that the family home is exempted from any asset test relating to payment for such care. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Robert Brown (from 30 citizens). Medicare Office: Salisbury To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of the Division of Bonython draws to the attention of the House: that the Medicare Office in Salisbury, South Australia which provides cash reimbursements on Medicare and Child Care rebates will cease operation altogether some time after November 1997. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House: allow the Salisbury Medicare office to continue to function as it does now, allowing the people resident in this area access to cash rebates across the counter, and all the other services presently provided by this office to the local community. by Mr Martyn Evans (from 128 citizens). Thailand To the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: We, the undersigned, believe the recent decision of by the Australian Government to contribute more than $1.4 billion to a bail-out of the Thai economy should have been debated in the Parliament before a decision was taken. We therefore call on the House to freeze Australia's involvement in the bail-out until Parliament has had the opportunity to properly debate the issue by way of an Appropriation Bill. As always, your petitioners humbly pray. by Mr Filing (from 1,818 citizens). Logging and Woodchipping To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. For permanent protection of old-growth forests and all other areas of high conservation value, and for the implementation of tree plantation strategies. This petition from the undersigned respectfully points out that: there is an increasing and urgent demand from the people, to protect all remaining high conservation value forests which support flora and fauna unique to Australia, thus complying with the United Nations Biodiversity Convention to which Australia is a signatory. We have a responsibility to future and present generations, and the necessary reasons, knowledge and technology to act now on the following achievable solutions. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of Representatives legislate to: Immediately stop all logging and woodchipping activities in high conservation value native forests; ensure intergenerational equity by planning for the rights of future generations, and protecting in perpetuity all biologically diverse old-growth forests, wilderness, rainforests and critical habitats of endangered species; facilitate rapid transition of the timber industry from harvesting high conservation value native forests to establishing mixed-species farm forestry on existing cleared and degraded lands, using non-toxic methods to protect ecological sustainability; maximise use of readily-available plantation timber for industry needs, using appropriate forestry techniques and progressive minimalwaste processing methods, such as radial sawing, and wherever possible, reuse and recycle wood and paper products; support incentives for nationwide employment in composting, soil remineralisation programs, and the planting of trees and annual fibre crops, inter-grown with appropriate fruit and nut trees and medicinal plants; encourage sensitively-managed, environmental education tourism in appropriate forest areas, with full respect for natural ecosystems, Aboriginal cultural heritage, sacred sites and other sites of significance; progressively utilise technological expertise and resources transferred from the military sector, to help implement these tree planting solutions; and to motivate the international community to follow this example. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Dr Lawrence (from 5,371 citizens). Cooked Chicken Meat Imports To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned draws to the attention of the House the importance of preserving high quarantine standards to maintain Australia's clean food reputation and to protect native wildlife. Your petitioners therefore requestThat the House call on the Federal Government to maintain the ban on cooked chicken meat imports because of the threat it poses to Australia's chicken meat industry, and the risk of introducing diseases which would threaten native bird life. by Mr Lee (from 48 citizens). Public Housing To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House. We the undersigned petitioners, who are residents of Victoria, call on our Commonwealth Government not to withdraw critical funding for the direct provision of Public Housing. Public Housing is an essential housing tenure for low income and other disadvantaged people in the Australian community, who otherwise have no long term or affordable housing options. We call on our Commonwealth Parliament to consider and accept the 1993 Industry Commission findings that the direct provision of Public Housing is the most cost-effective and efficient way of delivery housing assistance. Further the Commission found that direct rental assistance was the most inefficient and expensive use of public funds over the longer term. We invite our Commonwealth Parliament to learn from, and not repeat, the failed housing policies of overseas countries. We implore that you initiate a process for open and ongoing consultation with the community sector around future housing policy. With respect, we appeal to our Commonwealth Parliament to resist a short-sighted model of housing assistance, instead improving and expanding our much needed public housing system. by Ms Macklin (from 2,634 citizens). Medicare Office: Sunbury To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of certain residents of the State of Victoria draws to the attention of the House the need for a Medicare facility in the Sunbury township. Currently the residents of Sunbury have to travel long distances or have to wait weeks to receive their Medicare rebates. We definitely see the provision of a full Medicare Office as a preferred option, but would accept the establishment of a Medicare agency as a limited but acceptable alternative. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House urge the Government to urgently provide a Medicare facility in Sunbury. by Mr O'Keefe (from 30 citizens). Australian Head of State To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House that we the citizens of Australia want the Federal Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia to be aware of our desire for an Australian citizen to be the Head of State of Australia. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will support the will of the petitioners by relevant debate in the House to assist in achieving this outcome. by Mr Sawford (from 143 citizens). Nursing Homes To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents in Perth in the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House their view that nursing home care should be available to all Australians on the basis of need, not on an elderly person's capacity to pay for that care. Your petitioners therefore request the House note that those petitioners whose signatures appear below: (a) call on the Government to remove the 'accommodation bond' requirement for nursing home residents, and (b) call on the Government to provide capital funds for nursing home building upgrades from consolidated revenue, distributed on a needs basis. by Mr Stephen Smith (from 121 citizens). Petitions received. NA Private Health Insurance Debate resumed from 20 October, on motion by Mr Eoin Cameron. That this House: (1) acknowledges that Australia's health system is reliant on a successful private health insurance industry complementing the public health system; (2) notes with concern the neglect of the former Labor Government to stem the exodus from private health insurance between 1984 and 1996; (3) calls on the Australian Labor Party to agree to supporting incentives for private health insurance as part of its policy platform at its annual conference in 1998; (4) expresses its support for the incentives provided by the Fegeral Government for people to maintain private health insurance and for those who do not have it, to take it out; (5) calls on private health insurers to minimise any premium increases which may force more Australians to reconsider their membership; (6) welcomes any further policies which encourage people who can afford to take out private health insurance, to do so; and (7) calls on the Government to refer the issue of private health insurance and the Australian Health system to the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs for further solutions to alleviate the decline in private health insurance caused by the policies of the former Labor Government.",46
126,Dr NELSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"It gives me great pleasure to speak - to this private member's motion put forward by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron). I speak not only as a person with experience in medical politics and the development and enunciation of health financing policy but also as a doctor who has stood by the bedside of an elderly person in the midst of a public housing estate on numerous occasions when they have woken to find themselves having suffered a stroke or similar medical catastrophe in the early hours of the morning knowing that, if I send them to the public hospital, after six or seven hours in the department of emergency medicine they will be sent home and told that there is no bed for them. Such Australians-elderly people, low income people, vulnerable people-buy private health insurance not only to avoid waiting lists for joint replacements and other forms of elective surgery but so that they can get access to a bed when they know they need to be in one and when their doctors feel that is where they ought to be. The Australian health financing system has evolved from egalitarian principles and an extremely strong health insurance ethic. But unfortunately, over 13 years the Labor government politically and financially discouraged people from taking out private health insurance. When he was the Minister for Health, in April of 1992 the then minister Brian Howe said: Private health insurance makes an insignificant contribution to Australia's health financing. Yet it was raising in excess of $3 billion when the Medicare levy was raising $2.5 billion. That comment from the Labor health minister was the tip of an iceberg of ideological resentment of low income people in particular, whom they purport to represent, getting access to private health care. On 13 October that year, 1992, when I suggested to the then minister Brian Howe certain initiatives that would be required by the government of the day, whatever its political colour, to see that there was affordable access for high. risk and low income people, he said to me: 'Brendan, don't bother telling me what you think. If you want to change anything this government's doing, you'll have to change the government. ' The culmination of this attitude was during the March 1993 election campaign, when from the Royal Adelaide Hospital the then  the time to be worth something like $5 million-told Australians they didn't need private health insurance. He said they did not need it because they could rely on Medicare and it was doing a great job for them. On the same day one of my patients, who was a pensioner and a volunteer cleaner in the offices of a then Labor minister, said to me: 'Dr Nelson, I go without food to pay for it.' I remember the newspapers over Christmas 1995 reporting that the Hawkes, the Keatings, the Whitlams and other doyens of the Labor Party had gone into one of the most prestigious private hospitals in Australia-an act of which I am not at all critical; rather, it hypocrisy of their then telling the rest of the country, including a million families earning less than $40,000 a year, 850,000 pensioners and half a million people on health care cards, that they in some way do not need private health insurance. It is all very well for people driving the social justice truck to try to impose the same misery on everybody when they can take the parachute of paying cash to go into a private hospital but in the end the government of the day, as it does in education, has a responsibility to see that we have affordable access for low income and high risk individuals. The previous government withdrew its financial support to the reinsurance pool for the cost of insuring those over the age of 65, it removed its private bed day subsidy in 1986, it forced the private funds to cover 25 per cent of the Medicare benefit schedule fee, it pushed expensive prostheses on to basic tables, it then locked into the 1993 Medicare agreements powerful disincentives for having privately insured patients in public hospitals, so much so that nine per cent of public hospital income, which was then derived from the treatment of privately insured patients, has now dropped to less than three per cent. I call on the Australian Labor Party at its 1998 annual conference to adopt a policy which seeks to achieve some kind of bipartisanship in relation to support for private health insurance. There is not a place for ideological dogma in this. As in education, it is very important that the government of the day, irrespective of its political colour, uphold its political and economic responsibilities to low income people to give them support when they need it.

127,Mr MARTYN EVANS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The coalition parties in this country have always campaigned strongly on the issue of preserving Labor's health policies. Whether it is the Fraser government or the Howard government, those governments when in opposition prior to their election have always campaigned very strongly on the platform that they would retain Medicare, they would retain Medibank, they would retain Labor's health initiatives to the full extent in their policy. is the But when those governments have subsequently been elected, only then have the people of Australia discovered that those promises were not 'core' promises; they were 'non-core' promises. That meant in the case of the Fraser government that Medibank was savagely undermined, savagely cut. That government did everything that it possibly could with the now Prime Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), as its Treasurer to remove Medibank from the Australian political lexicon. During the election campaign the Prime Minister strongly and loudly advocated that Labor's health policy would be retained by him in office. But when we get them to office, what happens? The public again discover that this is a non-core promise and his government immediately proceeds to take hundreds of millions of dollars from Commonwealth health programs in payments to the states. It takes hundreds of millions of dollars from the Commonwealth dental program, leaving underprivileged people and pensioners without adequate access to dental care. It spends hundreds of millions-even $1.5 billion over three years-funding a subsidy to private health insurance, a subsidy which is immediately taken back by the health funds in significant increases to their premiums, increases which were approved by this government firstly by the junior officials in the department and then, when the government discovered to its embarrassment that the subsidy was soon to be eaten up by these increases, a committee consisting of the Minister for Health (Dr Wooldridge), the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) took over the task. They discovered that they also were in a position where they had to approve those very same kinds of increases. So, even before the subsidy was to be paid to Australians, they were discovering that bit by bit it was being eaten away by the health funds increasing their premiums-as any person might reasonably have expected they would, given the opportunity which the Howard government handed to them, the cheque which they handed to them on a plate. This government has wasted hundreds of millions of dollars which it could have given to our public hospitals by way of direct payments to the states, which would have increased the availability of funding for patients in our public hospitals, reduced the waiting lists and allowed patients to get their operations sooner, which would have made the Medicare system work even better. Instead those funds were diverted into an ineffective subsidy to private health insurance. What has that bought? It has bought almost nothing. Hundreds of millions of dollars have gone into purchasing a very small change in the trend in private health insurance. Part of that would be attributable not so much to the carrot as to the stick which this government applied by requiring higher income earners to purchase private insurance or face an increase in their levy. Those hundreds of millions of dollars have bought almost no change in that scenario; they have bought a significant undermining of the government's credibility in health insurance and health care policy. This government promised not only to pay that subsidy to Australians who bought private health insurance-certainly, that was part of the policy and I accept that that was part of the mandate-but also that the subsidy would not come from the payments to the states, from the payments to hospitals and from the payments for health care policy in this country-but it did. In budget after budget we have seen those payments undermined, reduced and slashed by this government to the point where that in itself is undermining Medicare. So let us not have the hypocrisy of calling on the Australian Labor Party to amend its policies on private health insurance. We have a very clear policy on it. We support Medicare-we invented that concept of public insurance in Australia-and we have provided sound public health policies for this country. It is the coalition government, through its diversion of funds from proper public health care to the private health sector-those subsidies-which is undermining health care in this country, undermining public support for Medicare and preventing our fine public hospitals from doing the kind of job which they are able to do when they get adequate support and resources from government. They did that job under us; they are not going to be able to do it under this government because the funds have been taken away. The hypocrisy, I suspect, lies in the way in which the coalition parties have treated the Australian public through core and non-core promises about health care. (Time expired)",50
128,Mr ANTHONY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I rise to support this motion put forward by the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron). It is important to understand that the Australian health system relies on a combination of both public and private systems-one cannot work without the other. The challenge is getting the balance right. Until recently we have had a private system that was haemorrhaging. This government supports freedom of choice for all Australian families wherever possible. Australians should be able to choose whether they want to belong to a trade union. Parents should be able to choose whether they send their children to public or private schools. Families should be able to choose whether they want public or private health care. This freedom of choice philosophy is in sharp contrast with that of the Labor Party, which behaves as if ordinary Australians are not clever enough to make their own choices. Labor are the party of whingeing hypocrites. Labor whinge about unemployment, but they did nothing about it for 13 years. Labor whinge about the standard of living of the workers they claim to represent, but, in just a decade of Labor, Australia fell from 10th to 22nd on the world income table. For the first time ever, we fell behind one of our neighbours, Singapore. We were overtaken by strike-ridden France, also under a socialist regime. Labor would even whinge about the budget deficit they created-that is, if they understood it. Labor whinge about the government's aged care reforms, but they ran down capital expenditure on nursing homes by over 75 per cent in the Keating-Hawke years. As a result, hospitals in Ballina, willumbah and Tweed Heads in my electorate all have a large proportion of beds taken up by elderly people who should properly be in nursing homes. And now Labor whinge about falling private health fund membership, but they did nothing about it for a decade. When they took office in 1983, private health cover was more than 60 per cent; when they were thrown out last year, that figure had dropped to a low of 30 per cent. This is yet another example of Labor mismanagement which led to this crisis-a crisis which is not of our making but which we are, nevertheless, setting out to fix. First, we introduced a one per cent Medicare surcharge for high income earners without private health cover. Then we brought in a tax incentive scheme to boost the membership of health funds-a $450 tax rebate for families in private funds. These measures took effect this year. The immediate result was that in the September quarter of 1997 we had the first increase in private health fund membership for over seven years. An extra 34,000 Australians were covered by private health insurance. This should be welcomed by the opposition. But what did the shadow spokesman, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), have to say? 'The figures highlight the government's total failure ... The increase is microscopic,' he sneered. I wonder if he would describe a 34,000 vote swing against him in Dobell as 'microscopic'. Other less biased observers took a different view from that of the shadow spokesman. 'Turnaround eases pressure on health funds', said the Melbourne Age; 'Incentives give private fund membership a healthy lift', said the Australian. The improved figures were also welcomed by the AMA, the Medical Benefits Fund and the Australian Health Insurance Association-by just about everyone, except those on the Labor front-bench. Mr Barresi-They don't like good news. Mr ANTHONYI thank the member for Deakin. It is true that we have a long way to go before we get back to the pre-Labor days or even to a situation where public and private health care are evenly split. It is also true that we have had only one increase in Mur- private membership so far. The government must therefore continue with incentives to keep Australians in health funds and to attract new members. At the same time, private health insurers must play their part by keeping premiums under control. They must do this in spite of the ever increasing drug costs and the fact that we have an ageing population. The ALP failed to stem the exodus from private health insurance from 1984 to 1996, and they stand condemned for that. But past incompetence is no reason for present recalcitrance. I join with my coalition colleagues in urging members in the ALP to pull their heads out of the sand and support the government's initiative on private health insurance. We need to have an adequate balance in private and public health systems.",52
129,Mr LEE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,The Labor Party support a balanced health care system. We think that it is very important that we continue to have in Australia vibrant public and private sectors to make sure that we get the best possible health system.,53
130,Mr ANTHONY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Rubbish!,53
131,Mr LEE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The member for Richmond says, 'Rubbish.' The difficulty the member for Richmond has is that the bogies and the demons he creates are often very different from the policies that the Labor Party actually advocate. The difficulty that people such as the member for Richmond have is that before the last election his party said that the centrepiece of their health policy would deliver tax breaks for private health insurance. They said that these tax breaks would make health insurance cheaper, would attract more people to private health insurance and therefore would take pressure off public hospitals. What has actually happened? Private health insurance has not become cheaper; it has become more expensive. Premium increases have swallowed up most of the benefit of that tax rebate. So we have had an increase in the cost of private health insurance, not a reduction. Have we seen the promised increase in the number of people who have taken out private health insurance? No, we have seen the reverse. We have had up to 1,000 people a day leaving private health insurance despite the fact that this government has introduced the rebate. On top of that, we have seen that, as a result of those changes, we have had an increase in the pressure on public hospitals, not a decrease. The real test for these people, if they really believe that this failed tax was a success, if they really think it is working, would be to advocate an increase in their failed, discredited tax rebate. If you really believe that the tax rebate was the solution to all the problems in health care, why aren't you out there persuading the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, that this policy is so successful that we should do more; let us have an even larger tax rebate? They are more to be pitied than despised. The reason they are not out there arguing that there should be an increase in the tax rebate is that in their heart of hearts they know that this is a lemon. This is the smallest, shrivelled lemon of a policy we have seen for decades in Australian health care. The reason it has failed is that this tax rebate has cost $1.7 billion, and that has been funded by cuts in federal funding for public hospitals of $800 million, a $500 million reduction in federal assistance for the cost of pharmaceuticals and the complete abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program. We have seen all of these cutbacks in public health programs being used to fund a tax rebate policy that has not delivered the benefits that the government claimed it would. We only have to look at the annual report that has just come through from PHIAC, which is supervising private health insurance. That indicates that over the last year the rate of premium increases has actually grown under this government rather than reduced; people are paying more for their private health insurance. We have seen an increase in the drop-out rate from private health insurance, despite the so-called benefits of your tax rebate. The other thing that is buried away in that report is the confirmation that the reserve levels for the funds have dropped another $122 million in the last year. What the member for Richmond and the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) are going to have to explain to their constituents is that this indicates there is another massive tidal wave of premium increases about to hit us, which will mean that there will be a further reduction in the number of people with private health insurance, despite your failed tax rebate. It is important to get over this government's rebate obsession with private health insurance.",53
132,Mr ANTHONY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Do you want to abolish private health cover?,53
133,Mr LEE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,-A third of people have got private health insurance and two-thirds do not. What the government has done in cutting federal funding for public hospitals is to create a crisis in our public hospital system right across the country.,53
134,Mr ANTHONY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Who created it?,54
135,Mr LEE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Whether or not we have got private health insurance, when we are really sick we rely on the public hospital to provide us with the health care that all of us need and deserve.",54
136,Mr ANTHONY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Who created it? You did!,54
137,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,I warn the member for Richmond.,54
138,Mr LEE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"That is the reason why we need to focus on providing additional federal and state funding for our public hospitals. It quality of our public hospital system that ultimately determines the level and the quality of health care that all Australians receive. This government will not be taking a proposal to the next election to increase the tax rebate because they know that this policy has been a failure. They know that health insurance premiums have gone through the roof. They know that more people are leaving private health insurance, not returning to it, and they know they have had to introduce federal funding cutbacks in the public hospital system just to fund their failed health insurance policies.",54
139,Mr MAREK,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Capricornia) (3.27 p.m.)After listening to the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), you really must wonder where he gets his information from. He was talking about private health insurance, and we can see why they are in so much trouble. When Labor came to power in 1983, 64 per cent of the population had private health insurance. By the time they left office in 1996, this had fallen to 34 per cent. Mr Latham-So what?",54
140,Mr MAREK,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"You say, 'So what?' You accept the fact that, because of the way you ran it, it failed.",54
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Order! The member for Capricornia will address his remarks through the chair. The member for Werriwa will get his tum next.,54
142,Mr MAREK,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I really appreciate the support of my good friend and colleague the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony). Labor did nothing to try to halt this. They have already admitted to the decline. They said, 'So what? It is not a problem.' That is fantastic. I am glad to see that you people admit the mistakes in what you put in place. In fact, when you really look at it, Labor hastened the decline by withdrawing the existing subsidies and pushing more costs onto the funds. I take it for granted you would accept that as well. This added to the funds' costs by about $850 million a year, which the Productivity Commission estimates has meant that premiums are 30 per cent higher than they would otherwise have been. We have already heard an is the admission from the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on the Labor Party side that they admit that the way they ran private health insurance meant that there was an incredible drop in membership while they were in power. Mr Latham-So what?",54
143,Mr MAREK,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Once again he says, 'So what?' You could not care less about the people out there in this country. I cannot believe that you would say that. It is incredible. It just goes to show how hypocritical and irresponsible you people really were. Why are premiums increasing? Premiums have been rising by - bout 12 per cent a year for the last 12 years. I would like to hear what the member for Werriwa's comments are in relation to that. Premiums only increased because the funds' payouts to their members have risen by an even greater amount. This reflects three things: first, members are claiming more money in benefits than the fund is earning in contribution income. Secondly, the decline in the membership over the last decade has meant that most of the funds now have a very high proportion of members who are very costly to insure. The opposition have admitted that as the reason for the decline; they totally accept that. They say, 'So what?' Old age or chronic illness are reasons why it has become very costly to insure people. Thirdly, health care generally has risen in cost much faster than inflation because of costly technology and other factors. I find it absolutely incredible-I am still overwhelmed by the fact-that the member for Werriwa has come forward and admitted that it was because of their poor policies, poor legislation and the way they ran and 'assisted' private health insurance that it destroyed itself. It is incredible that he is prepared to admit that, but it is great that at least he has had the gumption to come forward and say that he is responsible. Moving on from that, a successful private health insurance industry means that people who can afford to insure themselves against potential hospital health care costs leave the public health system available to those who can ill afford to pay. Mr Keating, a former Prime Minister in the Labor era, did not have private health insurance. He depended on the public system. I can see no reason why a man on an income like that could not have at least put his best foot forward and his hand in his pocket instead of denying a pensioner a place. Who is public health there for-people of extreme wealth like that? There is no reason why he could not have afforded his own private health insurance. If the majority of people living in this country attempt to access the public health system, the queues will grow. (Time expired)",54
144,Mr LATHAM,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), one of the real intellectual giants in the modern National Party, expressed some concern or surprise that I might say, 'So what?' to the news that membership of private health funds in Australia has fallen for the past decade. There are two basic reasons why I say, 'So what?' The first, if you look at the international evidence in health economics, is that there is no natural balance or equilibrium between the public and the private share in health care. What really matters is service utilisation. What matters is the delivery of services to people who need health care. The second reason relates to statistics: the proportion of national health expenditure funded out of health insurance funds at the introduction of Medicare in 1984 was 8.8 per cent-that is, close to one-tenth of all the health expenditure in Australia at the introduction of Medicare in 1984 came out of the health funds. If there were a crisis in private health their insurance in Australia, one would logically expect that figure to drop. One would think that people were using less private health insurance service utilisation than they were at the introduction of Medicare. The figures throughout the 1990s have actually gone up. There is a higher proportion of national health expenditure funded out of insurance funds in the 1990s than there was in 1984. The latest figures I looked at were over 11 per cent. So there is no crisis in private health insurance. This is one of the great lasting myths of Australian politics-talk of a crisis in the private health funds. What has happened is that membership has fallen. Those people who have stayed in the funds who need the services have actually increased their rate of service utilisation. Health insurance in Australia is contributing more to health care than it was at the introduction of Medicare. So why would government want to further subsidise private health insurance? Why would government want to put $500 million into a direct subsidy to the private health funds when, at the same time, it is taking $800 million out of its contribution to public hospitals? This is bad health economics. This is an appalling piece of public policy. At a time when the funds are doing more and their reserves are higher, why would the government want to subsidise those funds by half a billion dollars when the public hospitals which need the support are losing $800 million of Commonwealth funding? This is the health economics of the Keystone Cops. This is the maddest piece of public policy that one will ever see out of the Commonwealth parliament. This is a first-rate absurdity. The member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) has come here trying to perpetuate this myth of a crisis in private health insurance but I think it is a bad use of the House's time. Quite simply, this House should look at the figures for health expenditure utilisation and note that those Australians who have private health insurance are using more of the services and are contributing a higher prop ortion of total health expenditure in Australia in the 1990s than they were at the introduction of Medicare in 1984. As for why people have dropped out of the funds, that is quite simple: they were not getting value for money. The Liberal Party, not necessarily known for its public subsidisation policies, says that those people should not be exercising free choice to drop out but that goes against 20 or 30 years of their ideology. What happened to the party of choice? What happened to the party of market-driven operations? What happened to the party allowing competition between private and public health shares? People who were not getting value for money, such as younger, healthier people-I was one of those who dropped out for valid reasons-have found that they can rely, particularly during acute health care needs, on the public hospital system. That is what they found under the Labor government, but now the money is being ripped out of public hospitals. People have dropped out for valid reasons. There is no need for a subsidy to be developed by the Commonwealth government, especially when the private health funds have record reserves and assets. These are not organisations that are down on their knees financially; these are organisations which are doing better than ever, so why would they need public subsidies? Why do we need to take scarce public resources and put them in the hands of private health funds, all at a time when waiting lists around Australia for public hospital beds have consistently lengthened? If there is a problem with public hospital waiting lists, treat the patient at the source and put the $500 million into public hospitals so they can do something about the problem of waiting lists. Why go all the way around, bloating the private health fund reserves at a time when those reserves and those funds are doing more by way of their contribution to health expenditure and service utilisation in Australia? As I said, and I will keep on saying it, it is the maddest piece of public policy you will ever see in this place and the government stands condemned, as does the member for Stirling.",55
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned, and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Unemployment in the ACT",56
146,Ms ELLIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House notes: (1) that the ACT economy has been driven into recession by the Howard Federal Government and the Carnell ACT Government; (2) that youth unemployment in the ACT exceeded 50 per cent in consecutive months in late 1996 and has consistently been above the national average since the election of the Howard and Carnell Liberal Governments; (3) the significant reduction in public sector employment in the ACT flowing from Federal and Territory budget cuts; (4) the absolute failure of the ACT Liberal Government to implement policies that will contribute to a reduction in the high levels of unemployment; and (5) the implicit admission by the Howard Government that it has no answer to the unemployment crisis in the ACT. It gives me no pleasure to be moving this motion in the House today. In the first year of the Howard government, from March 1996 to March 1997, the ACT economy contracted by 1.1 per cent. Over this period, gross state product f-ll in three successive quarters and we had one quarter of zero growth. Two successive quarters of negative growth constitute a recession, hence the ACT was placed in recession. The ACT recorded the worse economic performance of any state or territory in the March 1997 quarter. While more recent figures show the ACT economy is beginning to rise from the depths to which it fell in the first year of the Howard government, many areas of the economy, such as housing and business investment, remain at historically low levels. We have seen an increase in the rate of personal bankruptcy in the territory of 59.8 per cent in 1996-97-the highest of any state or territory. That statistic is according to the advice of the CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service, a service which has seen an increase of 38.6 per cent in the number of people they see in financial crisis in the past 12 months. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised during the federal election campaign that public sector downsizing would be limited to 2,500. That was repeated again and again. In its first year, the government abolished 12,600 Public Service jobs and, according to the government's own budget papers, a further 16,500 jobs will be lost in the public sector in the 1997-98 financial year. Of course, the multiplier effect means that several thousand positions in the private sector have been and will continue to be lost. Another 8,500 jobs will go with the government's implementation of the Defence Efficiency Review. With the outsourcing of the Commonwealth's IT infrastructure, further massive job cuts are expected from 1998-99 and we think at least 1,000 jobs are threatened in that area. Unemployment is an enormous concern to the ACT community. In trend terms, when the Carnell Liberal government was elected in the ACT in February 1995, the unemployment figure was seven per cent. When the Howard Liberal government was elected in March 1996 it had risen to eight per cent. As of October 1997 it has been sitting at 8.4 per cent. Youth unemployment is also an extreme concern to our community. In that same period it has consistently bounced between 30 and 50 per cent. I use that terminology because obviously in the ACT the sample group is small and the figures can be very volatile. But it has never gone below 30 per cent and it has reached as high as 50 per cent. It has consistently remained above the national average. For example, ABS figures show that the unemployment rate for 15to 19-year-olds nearly doubled in the 15 months of the Carnell government: from June 1995 at 13.9 per cent to June 1996 at 25.4 per cent. In Public Service terms, the rate of employment in the ACT has fallen at both levels. At the ACT Public Service level it has fallen by 7.6 per cent since the ACT Liberal government was elected nearly three years ago and at the Commonwealth level by 7.8 per cent since the Howard government came to power. This has led to an overall decline in employment in the ACT of around 4.5 per cent through all sectors up until December 1996. The unemployment rate in the ACT has increased five consecutive months. What does the future hold? A legitimate question. The ANZ job ad survey trend figures continue to show a decline in job as in the most recent statistics available. The participation rate continues to fall as more discouraged workers leave the labour market. Again I ask: what does the future hold? In my view, the day we see both the ACT Liberal government and the Howard federal government voted out is the day that we will have an employment and economic future in the ACT that this community can look forward to. The CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service's statistics on bankruptcy and their client requirements-and they are a unique service in the ACT-have continued to increase at alarming levels. When you meet people in the street they have two major concerns. Firstly, if they are already in employment they have no idea for how long they will retain that employment, and their families live daily with insecurity, not knowing their future. Secondly, if they are out of employment they have absolutely no idea when they may be able to gain it. That is based on the total lack of confidence in both levels of government in the ACT. Both levels of government, the Carnell government at ACT level and the Howard government at federal level, stand condemned for what their actions have done to the ACT community. I thoroughly recommend the motion. I know that future speakers from my side will add more to this debate. Mr Dargavel-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",56
147,Mr NAIRN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Eden-Monaro) (3.43 p.m.)The motion by the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis) is clearly designed as a desperate attempt to get some publicity for her mates in the ACT Labor opposition as they head towards another defeat in the February 1998 elections. The thrust of her motion is about the reduction in the Public Service, youth unemployment figures and an economy in the ACT supposedly in recession. It is not, but I will come back to that later. The member for Namadgi is part of the flat earth society of the ALP. It is that section of the ALP who made sure socialism was kept in their party platform. They kept it there because that is what they believe in. They believe in government controlling all and providing for all. So the member for Namadgi cannot accept that Australia's overall economy will run better with a smaller government-one that pays its way and one that encourages private sector investment, which is the only way to create and sustain proper jobs. She wants to go back to a big spending government, putting the bill on the Beazley bankcard. That is her solution. She relishes the opportunity to give future generations a big bill, or so it would seem. Let me say a few words about changes in the Public Service and their impact on Canberra. The member for Namadgi's motion mentions significant reduction in Public Service employment in the ACT from federal and territory budget cuts. I am sure the member for Namadgi is fair and reasonable, so I am sure she is also referring to changes that took place under the former Labor government. Or is she being selective? We all know that the former Labor government made some dramatic changes to the Australian Public Service which saw many in the ACT lose their jobs. Between 1983 and 1996-through 13 years-over 23,000 Australian public servants were retrenched, but they would make you think that reductions in the Public Service started when the Howard government was elected. What did she say then? Where were the motions at that time? She was a member of the ACT Legislative Assembly during the very big decrease in the Public Service under Keating. I am sure she was not moving any motions against her federal colleagues, the same as the CPSU were absolutely silent year after year. I do not recall her being concerned at the debt the previous Labor government was clocking up-debt that means her constituents have to watch about $9 billion of taxpayers' money per year being spent on servicing the interest on that large debt, predominantly clocked up in the last five years of Labor. I am sure her constituents would prefer to see that $9 billion being spent on services like health and education. We certainly wl!..nt to do that, but we cannot do it until we reduce that debt, and part of the process is to get the budget out of deficit and into surplus. We will do that next year, and the member for Namadgi should be congratulating us. With the budget in surplus and the debt being reduced, we will be able to give extra benefits that I am sure her constituents want-on top of the benefits they have already received through low interest rates and low inflation. Interest rates have seen average home mortgage repayments drop by about $300 per month, and that is a real benefit that people understand. Labor want to keep spending on top of spending, and their only solution will inevitably be higher taxes. The member for Namadgi should be honest enough to tell her constituents that that is what Labor propose to do. Let me deal with some of the claims made by the member for Namadgi. She claims that the ACT economy is in recession. I think she needs a few lessons in economics because the ABS figures show three consecutive quarters of growth in gross state product-hardly a recession-with continual growth in private sector investment in the ACT since June 1996. The Yellow Pages Small Business Index for the quarter to the end of October shows that sales and profits in the ACT small business sector were the best for the past two years. The index found that a net of 33 per cent of small businesses in the ACT reported sales growth-more than double the previous quarter. The result is the strongest since the index began surveying ACT small businesses two years ago. Nearly half of small businesses expect conditions to improve further in the next quarter-a definite sign of confidence growing in the ACT small business economy. The Morgan and Banks job index found that employment prospects in the ACT are improving strongly. New motor vehicle registrations are on the rise, and there is consistently strong growth in retail sales. We know that retail sales right across the board in Australia have risen dramatically over the last three months, as has private investmentand investment is what it is all about. As far as the ACT government is concerned, the Carnell Liberal government have been instrumental in creating an environment conducive to growth in the private sector. Things they have been doing include granting exemption from payroll tax for two years for employees who have been out of work for more than 12 months. Payroll tax impact will also be reduced by increasing the tax threshold from $550,000 to $800,000 from 1 January 1998. Payroll tax is a significant disincentive to employ, and I know that myself. I remember going through a period of growth in my company and verging on falling into that payroll tax net. It is great disincenjobs tive to employ, until eventually you fall into it because you have people working overtime. Increasing that threshold is going to help businesses, but on the other side of the House they do not know much about that. The member for Namadgi mentioned bankruptcy figures. She thinks that somebody going bankrupt today is all because of something that has happened in the last few weeks or the last few months. She shows a total lack of understanding of how business works. Bankruptcy figures in the last 12 months or so have been caused by what Labor did in the previous few years. During the recession of the early 1990s with the high interest rates, I remember paying 21.75 per cent on my overdraft in business. You have never been there and you would not know what it is like. They are the things that send businesses bankrupt, but they do not send them bankrupt next week; it takes about 12 months to two years to happen. You do not understand how business works. You stand up here quoting bankruptcy figures, and it is all. because of what happened under Keating in the last five years before we came to government. Under the Carnell government 1,542 jobs will be created over the next three years through the ACT business incentive scheme. They are really getting on and doing things. As far as youth is concerned, the Youth 500 scheme aims to create 500 jobs by Christmas. I understand that, as of last Friday, 28 November, 432 young people have found jobs as a result of that scheme. There are other schemes: $225,000 for job youthlink; youth selfstart; $625,000 for the accelerated data collection program, which is providing training and employment for young people; $290,000 for the annual employment grants program; and $200,000 for Canberra's three Open Access centres. At a federal level, the commitments the Howard government has made to the ACT have been quite dramatic. The Federation Fund will provide $146.9 million for the development of the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies on Acton Peninsula, which will mean 1,000 during their construction. Funding to the National Capital Authority was increased by 16 per cent in the 1997-98 budget for work on the assets of the national capital. There has been $85 million committed to the ongoing redevelopment of the Russell offices and $20 million to the refurbishment of galleries in the Australian War Memorial. All of these things mean jobs in the ACT. The changes that have occurred in the ACT economy over the past decade-not just the past 20 months-with the shift from the public sector to the private sector is good news for the region. The ACT. economy previously relied almost totally on one big client, federal government, dishing out a cheque each week. Now it is being much more diverse; it is looking around the region and growing far more naturally. The motion moved by the member for N amadgi is obviously part of Labor's election campaign in the ACT. She thinks she is still in the ACT Assembly. I am sure she would not want to go back there. If she did, she would still be in opposition. Kate Carnell has done a great job for the ACT, and I am confident that the people of the ACT will want her to remain Chief Minister after the next federal election.",57
148,Mr DARGAVEL,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Fraser) (3.53 p.m.)Both the federal government and the ACT government have sacked thousands of workers in the ACT as their contribution to the ACT's recession, as declared by Access Economicsnot exactly a red ragging think-tank; probably on the conservative end of the spectrum. Access Economics says that the ACT entered into a recession largely as a result of public sector redundancies, which had spin-off effects on the private sector. The effects of those redundancies are seen throughout the economic indicators of the ACT, and it is pretty difficult to argue against them. The Chief Minister, Kate Carnell, has said that she solidly supports the federal government's economic agenda. We take that to mean that she solidly supports the federal government's cuts to the ACT economy. That is pretty much in line with the thousands of redundancies which she herself implemented in the ACT public sector. The consequences of that action can be seen immediately in youth unemployment. We exceeded 50 per cent youth unemployment late last year, and our rate has been consistently higher than the national average pretty much ever since the election of the conservative governments, federally and locally. There has been a significant reduction in public sector employment; the flow-on effects, as I have said, have been quite dramatic. There have been around 10,000 jobs affected locally. The federal coalition government has foreshadowed that there will be 16,500 public sector redundancies. In the first 18 months of this government, 30,000 jobs have been lost out of the public sector-and that is just in the first 18 months. There was an efficiency dividend under Labor over 13 years. But there is a big difference between an efficiency dividend over 13 years and the sorts of job cuts that this government has introduced in the public sector and their consequent flow-on effects to the private sector. Economic growth in the ACT has fallen below the national average. Housing prices have dropped. New building approvals have reached their lowest point since the collection of statistics were begun. Unemployment has reached 8.2 per cent-one of the highest unemployment rates in the history of the territory. Child care has been hit particularly hard, which makes life very difficult for working families. And the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn), the previous speaker, claims that things in the ACT are just peachy. If he lived here, he would understand that things are very difficult, particularly for working families. All other states and territories received an increase in general revenue funding from the Commonwealth in the last budget. If you add inflation to the equation, the ACT suffered a cut in real terms unlike that suffered by any other state or territory in Australia. Not only is the government unable to provide adequate resources for its own programs to resolve the ACT's unemployment crisis; it refuses to provide any additional provisions for the ACT in recompense for the cuts that it has made to the local area. To provide less money in last year's budget and a cut in real terms for the ACT when compared with funding for every· other state and territory is a bit rich after you have applied the sorts of redundancies that we have had to sustain. In summary, the ACT asks for no special favours. We ask merely that we be treated equally with other states and territories, and that we not be maligned and abused by this government. The local ACT government has been complicit in the attacks that have been mounted upon the ACT by the federal government--or as summarised by coalition Senator Ian Campbell when he said that the ACT recession was 'quite an achievement'. All I would say is that they must have been trying very hard. Mr SHARP CHume) (3.57 p.m.)-I rise in support of those on this side of the House, particularly the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Nairn) who has been making, I think, some very valid points in this debateprincipally, of course, that this is a very cynical exercise being undertaken by the Labor opposition here in Parliament House to support and try to buttress its colleagues in the ACT Legislative Assembly. As they go to the ballot box in February, this is the last opportunity the federal Labor opposition will have to support them. This government has undertaken a number of very substantial initiatives which have been designed to improve the ACT economy: improvements that the previous Labor government, which had 13 years in office, failed to take up. I will highlight in my remarks this afternoon just some of those initiatives that have been undertaken by this coalition government-this Liberal-National Party government in Canberra-that are designed to boost the basic infrastructure and the basic economy of the ACT to enable it to evolve from a government dominated economy to a private sector dominated economy. For example, I draw to the attention of the House the decision by this government to support the declaration of Canberra as an international airport. They had 13 years in government, 13 years of opportunity to determine that the Canberra airport could be made into an international airport, providing the ACT economy and the region that surrounds it with the opportunities that come from having a properly declared international airport in their midst. That international airport will create new opportunities, new economic activity, for the ACT. I also draw to the attention of the House the high speed train proposal, which was there in its origins throughout the Labor years, but which was denied by the Labor government. They put the kybosh on the high speed train proposal when it came forward in its original format and would not allow it to proceed. The federal Labor government would not give it the necessary encouragement and support that the high speed train proponents wanted and needed so desperately from them. Upon entering office, this federal government went about as quickly as it could to ensure the facilitation of the aims and ambitions of a lot of people who live in this region to see a high speed train proposal not be just a proposal but actually come to fruition. That process, under the chairmanship of Mr Jim Servis, is well and truly on its way. We can see the economic opportunities of that proposal. It is a $1.5 to $2.5 billion proposal. a project that will have enormous ramifications for this district, and it is well under under a coalition government. It was blocked by the previous Labor government. We now see additional major infrastructure improvements in the region. For example, in 13 years of office the federal Labor government failed to bring the Federal Highway to four-lane dual carriageway standard. The previous government could have put the Sutton turn-off to the ACT border into Stirling Avenue into their five-year plan. When we came into office, it was not in the five year plan. You will now find it in the five year plan. Some $70 million worth of funds that the previous Labor government did not earmark for the ACT economy is now there for the current five-year plan that will go into the ACT economy. Let me turn to the Murrumbateman bypass, which is an essential ingredient to the economy of Canberra. The Murrumbateman bypass is an enormous project of great economic value to the ACT. It was not in the previous Labor government's five-year program for road upgrading to the Federal Highway system. It is in the five-year plan brought forward by this coaJition government. I want to refer to two other major road projects that will be of significance to the ACT economy. Trunk road 92 will be a main road servicing Canberra to the coast down to Nowra. It was denied by the previous Labor government. The planning for that project is now under way under this new coalition government. It is a huge project-$50 million-and will be of great advantage to the ACT economy. I also want to refer to Tumut Road, which runs through the Brindabellas to link into the busy craft mill that is proposed to be built in Tumut very shortly. Again, this is something which this government js prepared to countenance. It is actively working towards something of great value to the ACT economy in terms of generating extra revenue plus the money that is spent in the process of building it. (Time expired)",59
149,Mr MCMULLAN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Canberra) (4.02 p.m.)I have pleasure in rising to support the motion It is moved by my colleague the member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis). I congratulate her on the way initiative. It is very important that she, the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel) and I have this opportunity to illustrate the recession that we have been suffering in the ACT and in the region. It is amazing to hear the representatives of the region advocating the policies that have decimated their regions. I suppose we should not be surprised by the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), who does not even know when he is in the region, but for the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn) it is a very sad event. I think everybody in Queanbeyan in particularMr Nairn-It is sad to see proper regional development.",61
150,Mr MCMULLAN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"You abolished the regional development program. You said that you would not do it, and you did it as soon as you came in. Mr Sharp interJecting",62
151,Mr MCMULLAN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"You did it actually, but he is responsible. Everybody in Queanbeyan ought to hear what the member for Eden Monaro has had to say about how good things have been for them since this government came in. I am obviously very concerned about the recession in the ACT and the region. The fact is that it has not been an accident; it been a product of the conscious policy of this government. What Senator Campbell's sin was when he said, 'What a great achievement,' was not have to created a policy; it was to have exposed the policy. Everybody in Canberra already knew that that was the attitude of this government. It just took somebody to come out honestly and say so. The best story around Canberra is that the only bigger joke than Senator Campbell is the joke where people say, 'What could be worse for Canberra than a Liberal government?' The answer is two Liberal governments. That is what we have at the moment. It is very important that we make sure that that circumstance does not continue. The ACT government, instead of taking countervailing action to mitigate the consequences of the disastrous policies of this government on the people of the ACT and Queanbeyan, have made it worse. They campaigned for the election of this government, with its subsequent consequences on the ACT. We saw Kate Carnell campaigning for John Howard. He is the Prime Minister that she chose fnr the people of Canberra, and the consequences have been disastrous. The government consciously set out to destroy jobs in Canberra and in the region, and they have succeeded. It is one of the few goals they have set which they have succeeded in. They have not done much for the region either. The economy of this region is primarily dependent upon the Public Service and the private sector jobs that spin off it, upon the universities and upon information technology. They are three of the five major elements of the ACT and regional economy. All three of them have been disastrously affected by the policies of this government. It is an unexpected benefit from the excellent motion moved by the member for Namadgi that the member for Eden-Monaro has been flushed out to say that he thinks what is happening here is pretty good. The people of Queanbeyan have never had it so good. They should be pleased about the fact that the economy is in recession, that they are has losing jobs, that it has had terrible consequences for all the businesses in the region. Their local member thinks it is wonderful. He does not see his role as an advocate for the region to the government; he sees his role as an advocate for the government to the region. That is a fundamental misunderstanding of his role, and it is a misunderstanding we will be very pleased to point out again and again to the electors of Eden-Monaro. I am surprised that we have had such an exposition of support for the policies of this government as they have impacted on the region. I am not surprised at the member for Hume, but I am very surprised that the member for Eden-Monaro should have exposed his weakness in that way. Why would any local member be proud that their government has caused housing prices to fall? Why would any member be proud that the government he supports has caused jobs to fall? They advocate how good their policies have been for the private sector. Why would anybody be proud that they have put bankruptcies up? The only things that have gone up under this ACT government are unemployment and bankruptcies. It has been bad for the ACT and for the region. The lives of tax paying, law abiding Australians and their families are being adversely affected. I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the motion by the member for Namadgi. It is very important that we make that clear.",62
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Gold Industry,63
153,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"This afternoon I grieve for one of Australia's great industries-the gold industry. I grieve for the lamentable conduct of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for doing their best to damage the market sentiment for gold and for Australia's gold producers. Australia is the world's third largest gold producer and gold is our second biggest exporter. What is not generally understood so far as the gold industry is concerned is that this is an industry within Australia which is highly regionalised. It is made up not just of large gold producers but a number of highly diverse smaller and medium size gold producers scattered throughout regional Western Australia, regional Queensland and regional New South Wales. So the economic consequences for regional Australia of damaging the market sentiment for gold are very high cost ones indeed. It is worth relating to the House the history of this matter. We saw at the end of last week the gold price fall below $US300 for the first time since 1985. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister stand condemned for the way in which they have conducted themselves so far as the gold industry is concerned. We have seen in recent days the parlous state of Australia's gold industry throughout the financial and other pages of the nation's media: 'Wave of fear as gold stocks battered again'; 'Prospects dim for rig contractors'; 'Gold hits 12-year low, sparking deficit fears'. These are the litany of sins for which the Treasurer and the Prime Minister hold their degree of culpability. The starting point for this was the RBA decision to sell 167 tonnes of gold on 4 July this year. That was a unique event because it was the first occasion on which a worldleading gold producer determined to sell gold. It was not so much the actions of the RBA but the actions of the Treasurer in the aftermath of the announcement of the decision to sell the gold which so severely damaged the sentiment for gold in the marketplace. When the Treasurer was interviewed on the morning of the announcement, he had this to say: Why hold any gold at all? It's really only for the purposes of diversification. The Reserve's looked at its portfolio, it believes that there's a value in holding some gold reserves but not the gold reserves to the extent that it used to. In the same interview, he said: Gold producers are people that are producing for all sorts of levels, including international markets and there'll always be an international market for gold. People in international markets will want gold for decorative and jewellery purposes ... So, standing there as the Treasurer of the Australian Commonwealth, he said to the market, 'This is not an industry that we care about. This is not an industry that we have any sentiment for. This is not an industry that we need to hold in any way especial. This is not an industry which we regard as having any other role in life other than proceeding on the basis that there will always be an international market because people wear gold jewellery.' A couple of days later, on 9 July, the Prime Minister said: Gold producers both in Australia and elsewhere. many of them have been themselves behaving in a way over recent months which has exerted downward pressure on the price of gold. That was code for what it precisely received on the front page of the West Australian: 'Miners to blame for gold crisis: PM'. Here. the Treasurer is saying, 'There'll always be a market for gold because people like wearing gold jewellery.' The Prime Minister is saying, 'It's all the gold producers' fault.' A week or so after the event, the penny had finally dropped with the Treasurer. He was interviewed in Cairns on 10 July, and he had this to say: In relation to the gold industry, the gold industry in Australia is a very important industry. It's one that we value and we have confidence in the gold industry and we'd like to see it continue and I have no doubt that it will. On the following day, again in Cairns, he said: ... I think I said yesterday that the Australian gold industry is a good industry. It is a good industry and the Australian gold industry will always be a world competitive industry. It is a pity that he did not express these sentiments on the day of the announcement. Indeed, it is a pity that he did not express sentiments like this in the course of the sixmonth period when the sell-off was occurring without any publicity. The Reserve Bank of Australia is charged with managing the announcement effects of interest rate increases or reductions, and for the one-off occasion that it had the job of managing the announcement effects of the sale of gold-Australia being the third largest producer in the world-the Treasurer comprehensively mucked it up and did such damage to the sentiment in the marketplace for Australian gold that we have now seen Australia's gold industry so very badly placed to cope with and cater for the fall in gold prices that we have seen continue from that day. I took the opportunity of raising some questions with the Governor of the Reserve Bank by correspondence after the Governor was interviewed in the Australian on this matter to try to clarify and ascertain the Treasurer's role. On 22 July, the Governor of the Reserve Bank wrote to me in response to my questions in the following terms: It was the Bank's decision to sell the gold. It was the Treasurer's decision on how to dispose of the realised profits. The Reserve Bank Act specifies these separate responsibilities. In for the Treasurer to make his decision, he had to be fully informed of what our proposals were. For this reason, consultation was necessary. In making the decision on gold sales, both the national interest and possible implications for the gold mining industry were taken into account. These matters are not subject to credible quantification, even after the event. The problem for the Treasurer and the Reserve Bank is that the Governor of the Reserve Bank has sprung the Treasurer. The Treasurer was fully aware of the potential adverse consequences for jobs, for regional Australia and for exports when he gave the green light. The Governor of the Reserve Bank wrote on 22 July that these things are not subject to credible quantification. The great tragedy now is that we see the credible quantification occurring day by day, the most recent example being the closure of the Mount Todd gold mine in the Northern Territory the week before last. The owners and managers of that mine made it crystal clear that one of the reasons for the closure of that mine was the adverse consequences caused by the RBA's decision and the government's handling of it. As Barry FitzGerald in the Age of today says: THERE won't be a present from the Australian gold industry under the Christmas tree for the federal Treasurer, Peter Costello, thanks to his over-the-top endorsement of the Reserve Bank's gold sell-off earlier this year. I raised the Mount Todd matter with the Prime Minister in question time on 18 November. The Prime Minister said: I say to the member for Perth that the decision that was taken by the Reserve Bank of Australia to sell gold was fully in accord with well developed international practice in relation to gold. What the Prime Minister did not appreciate at the time of the sell-off or now is that Australia is in a qualitatively different position from other central banks who have sold gold. This is the first occasion on which a major gold producer has sold gold other than where the seller of gold is the official arm of that country's producer. So we are in a qualitatively different position from the sorts of examples which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have alluded order to publicly or by way of correspondence. It is all well and good for Belgium to sell off gold, for the Netherlands to sell off gold and for the Swiss to sell off gold, but the difference between us and them is that they are either small or not producers at all and we are a substantial and significant gold producer. The key difference that the Prime Minister fails to appreciate is that we are in a qualitatively different position and had to manage the sale of our gold, the green light having been given, in a much more assiduous way. It might actually have helped if, once the Treasurer had given the green light, he was out there saying things which might have helped bolster the sentiment for gold in the Australian community. It might have helped if the government had said, 'Well, we'll drop off our proposal to cap the diesel fuel rebate because we know how important that is to the international competitiveness of the gold industry and Australia's minerals and resources industry generally.' The government might actually have said, 'We might drop off the retrospective taxation of the sale of a prospector's right under section 23PA,' a decision announced by the Treasurer in the August 1996 budget. They might also have suggested to their Western Australian state colleagues that the imposition of a gold royalty was very badly timed. If it was a good idea, it certainly was not a good idea to occur in this context. Belatedly, on 18 November-the same day that I asked the Prime Minister the question that I referred to-we saw the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) issue a press release headed 'New government moves to support gold industry'. Good old Warwick, loyal to a fault. The only problem is that he is about six or nine months too late. Senator Parer has effectively announced a series of measures to a talkfest to coincide with ABARE's annual Outlook Conference in February 1998. The measures which Minister Parer has outlined in his release of 18 November are all well and good. It is a pity that no-one bothered to consult the Minister for Resources and Energy in the run-up to the RBA's decision and the Treasurer's comment. He may have been in a position to edify the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. There is one important point to be made. One of the adverse consequences in the downturn of the gold industry will be the adverse consequences it has for exploration. In the most recent ABS statistics on private mineral exploration, which were released in September for the June quarter, the ABS says that the upward trend in exploration expenditure since the June quarter is made up of 62 per cent gold exploration activity. (Time expired) Electorate of Ballarat Native Title",63
154,Mr RONALDSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development) (4.18 p.m.)-It is a great pleasure to have 10 minutes to talk about my electorate. I do so in the context of the significant initiatives that the HowardFischer coalition government has introduced since the election in ,March last year and how they relate to matters that have affected my electorate and some of the real advantages that have been delivered by those initiatives. The advent of communications as we march towards 2000 has enabled a changing face in regional Australia, one that this parliament must certainly take advantage of. Just as an example, my electorate was fortunate enough to get what is called a Department of Social Security teleservice centre, or call centre, which provided 100 new jobs. It went into the Central Highlands Water Building, which was underutilised. They are new jobs. Indeed, it is providing employment opportunities for rural and regional Victorians. There are - a large number of people from both within Ballarat and the outlying areas of Ballarat who have been able to access this centre. It basically means that people in non-metropolitan Australia are able to take advantage of new communications technology which will deliver them jobs. The other interesting thing is the government's move to outsource some of its information technology. That has quite directly advantaged the mM Geoplex complex in Ballarat. It is now one of the largest computer data storage facilities in the world. It not only brings jobs and infrastructure to Ballarat but also, in association with the Ballarat University, makes the region an educational and career magnet for information technology, meaning that young people can stay in our region, study and find employment in locally based industries. There has been a large amount of moneys in relation to the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund, otherwise known as Networking the Nation. I am very pleased that last week an announcement was made that the University of Ballarat and a group known as the Volunteers for Isolated Students Education have secured $150,000 to assist families and business in rural Australia to acquire the skills and confidence to access and utilise services and facilities available on the Internet. Networking the Nation will assist the economic and social development of regional, rural and remote Australia by funding projects which enhance telecommunications infrastructure and services, increase access and reduce disparities between urban and rural Australia. At the end of the day, it is absolutely incumbent upon this parliament to ensure that non-metropolitan Australians are able to access the advantages that their metropolitan counterparts enjoy. We need to stop this appalling drift from regional and rural Australia to metropolitan areas, which has been going on now for some 20 years-unfortunately, greatly speeded up by the effects of the recession. I think that some people in the House today do not realise that areas such as mine, the electorate of Ballarat, the electorate of Bendigo and other surrounding electorates, actually went into recession well before their metropolitan counterparts. Indeed, we are struggling harder to get out of it, but I am pleased that the coalition government is at least making moves which will enhance our opportunities to drive job growth. The Natural Heritage Fund has put a considerable amount of money into my electorate. I am very proud that we have had several Green Corps programs, which are operated by the Ballarat based Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers, iI.1 my electorate-and all have been highly successful. The black spot program is a great initiative of the member for Hume, who has been mentioned several times today, which is providing safety to rural and regional Australians. Indeed, it was part of the program guidelines that at least 50 per cent of those funds go to regional and rural Australia. The work for the dole scheme has been very enthusiastically endorsed by my constituents in the electorate of Ballarat. There are now two projects where young people will start within the next week. They have been queuing up for this opportunity. I am pleased they have taken this opportunity. It reinforces my very strong view that people basically want a chance. I get very angry when I hear our young people being attacked for not being interested in working, in making their mark on our country's future. I believe they do. I believe they are ready, willing and able to do so; they just need the opportunities. They have enthusiastically endorsed the work for the dole program. Just out of interest I jumped on my calculator the other day and in the last 18 monthsjust from the matters I could add up-some $52 million has gone into my electorate. I am not saying that that is to all new programs, but there are new initiatives, with which I am very proudly associated, which cover a range of things across the board, including marriage and relationship services, special jobs funding for disadvantaged young people and a new carer respite centre. Carers are the unsung heroes of Australia, with nearly two million carers in Australia. They are great people doing a marvellous job and they deserve every bit of support that they can get. We are still doing it tough in non-metropolitan Australia. This parliament must drive the opportunities for non-metropolitan Australia. I am very pleased that some of the initiatives we have put in place since coming into power have very much helped my constituents. I now want to tum briefly to the lO-point plan. I want to give two quotes to put this whole debate into some sort of perspective. I have had a group demonstrating outside my office for the last five days. They are decent honourable people, most of whom I know well and have a great deal of respect for. But the point that needs to be made is that in 1993 when the Native Title Act was passed by this House and the Senate I did not have one single person knocking on my door to talk about pastoral leases. Not one single person came to me and said, 'We are demonstrating out the front of your office because you have extinguished native title on pastoral leases.' Not one single person! Just to put this into perspective, I will quote two people who made it quite clear that the effect of the Native Title Act was to extinguish native title on pastoral leases. The former Prime Minister Paul Keating said on AM on 19 October 1993: ... I negotiated an agreement between the Aboriginal community and the National Farmers' Federation on the question of pastoral leases and, I with a very good outcome. What it will mean is that native title will be extinguished on pastoral leases-that is, not to the extent of any inconsistency but extinguished. Probably the most telling, though, is a ment by Mr Noel Pearson on 10 November 1993: . . . I rule out the possibility in Queensland people pursuing any rights in relation to pastoral leases owned by non-Aboriginal people. I rule that out categorically ... I plead with everyone in this House to read letter from the Hon. Bill Hayden AC written to the Hon. Rob Borbidge on 21 March 1997. I am sure this man is a man of honour. He is a decent, credible man. His role as the chief negotiator with the right to negotiate respect of the Century Zinc mineral project and the comments he made are absolutely pertinent to this. I am terribly sorry that my time is just about to run out. He said-and this is just a start: What became abundantly clear to me quite early is how complex, even confusing, the drafting of the relevant legislation is. (Time expired) Medicare: Closure of Belmont Office  p.m.)-My grievance this afternoon is the decision of the government, recently conoffice firmed by the Minister for Health and Family levels. Services (Dr Wooldridge), to close the Medicare office at Belmont in my electorate. Belmont is the geographical centre of my electorate. I have previously spoken in this House against the closure. I made representathe tions to the minister, to which I have recently received a reply. I have met with business people in the Belmont area. They have exMedicare pressed to me their grave concern about the impact the closure of the Belmont Medicare office is going to have on the service to the public in that area and on the business centre of Belmont. I have also met with residents. I presented petitions, on behalf of some 7,877 signatories, to this chamber earlier in the year on different occasions. I have not seen an issue in my area where there has been such a strength of expression against a proposed action by a think, government as there has been with the opposition to the closure of Belmont Medicare office. I set out in a letter to the minister on 21 August all the factors that were involved. In comthis case, the Belmont Medicare office was moved from the Pacific Highway in July last year into Belmont Citi Centre, which is the of major shopping centre. The new fit-out costs of that location were borne by the landlord. The first year of occupancy was free. Almost as soon as the first year of occupancy was a over-the free year of occupancy-the Health Insurance Commission then asked that the lease be waived. It is a great way to do business: they get a free fit-out worth tens of thousands of dollars and a free year's rent and team in then ask whether they can leave. The turnover at the new premises was some 20 per cent up on the previous comparable location. The Belmont Medicare office has nice, easy access for people with disabilities. The nearest office for people who use the Belmont office is at Charlestown, some six kilometres to the north, or at Wyong, 49 kilometres to the south on the Pacific Highway. Accessing the Charlestown office is difficult. It is in a very large shopping centreSquare. It is extremely difficult for people with disabilities to get to that because of steps, grades and differing The Belmont Medicare office has provided a superb service to my constituents in that area and people from the adjoining electorates of Charlton and Dobell. The decision to close Medicare office, as so many of us know, has nothing whatsoever to do with the economics or the commercial results of the service. It has to do with dismantling Medicare. When the closure was first mooted, when the first leak came, we said at that time that this was the first step by this government towards dismantling Medicare. It mirrors the action taken by the Fraser government. During the seven-year life of the Fraser government there were nine different health schemes, all aimed at maintaining what was then known as Medibank. Today's Medicare is a later version of what was then Medibank. Bit by bit the Fraser government dismantled it and it paid the price later, just as this government will pay the price. People dearly value Medicare. This government does not seem to understand that the people who use the cash claims offices of Medicare do so because they have to. In many parts. of my electorate people go to the doctor, pay their bill, go straight to a Medicare office to get their cash refund and then go to the pharmacy. Medicare offices are located in the vicinity of health centres. They provide that service to people. It is not an option for people to go up to Charlestown or south to Charmhaven. It will cause disruption and inconvenience for those people. For people living near the empty purse level, every dollar and every cent counts. This is simply the implementation of political ideology by this government. They hate Medicare, they hate community health services and they want to see an end to the Medicare service so they can have that service and those types of health services transferred to their friends in the private sector. For proof of that we have only to consider the utterances coming from the voluntary health insurance fund organisation from time to time. Remember the people in that organisation are the people who were on former Prime Minister Fraser's staff. Former Prime Minister Fraser's senior press secretary, Mr Russell Schneider, is the principal, and he has been there ever since he left the Fraser government. The same is happening with this government. 'We will maintain Medicare,' they said, but now they are proceeding to dismantle it finger by finger, hand by hand, a piece at a time-death by a thousand cuts-as they try to force people into private health care, into getting private medical treatment. The minister responded to my letter: Closing Medicare offices is always a delicate decision. We need to be fair and reasonable in striking a balance across Australia between providEach ing reasonable access to Medicare and the efficient use of taxpayer funds. Is closing Medicare offices in low income areas being fair and reasonable? Is that the way we become efficient? We do have an efficient service. The turnover went up. Since the announcement of the possible closure of the office the turnover dipped down and it is now on the rise again because people are realising that the office is still open. I have not been told when the office will be closed. I am told the government has scheduled its closure for 27 March next year. But I say to the people I represent that we will do everything possible, through public utterances and public expression, to keep pressure on this government to prevent the closure of the office. This is an essential public health service, an essential public facility, that is vital not only to the business people of the area but to the residents of the area and sick Australians who need to go to doctors, who need to go to hospitals and who need to have pharmaceuticals. The minister then says it 'was selected for closure after considering the criteria applied to all Medicare offices'. He says they look at: . claiming patterns ... . cash service workloadsBelmont has less than 400 daily cash claimsproximity to other Medicare offices (12 kilometres or less) leasing and other property issueswhich is obviously not relevant here. Those factors that are being looked at have nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that this is a successful service and is widely used. As I said, the almost 8,000 people who have put their names to petitions want that service carried on because they need it. There were no problems with the centre or its quality of service. It has been a very successful service with growing utilisation. We are really seeing the continuation of the government's attack upon Medicare and the system they inherited from Labor. I say to members of the government: do not think that you are going to get away with it. day that ticks by is a day closer to the election, and the closer that election comes the more these issues will take on increased importance, because people see the government for what it is. It promised to maintain Medicare, but it is now trying to abolish it by other means-by surreptitious means, by blaming other factors for its decision to close down services. We need to add to that the government's attempt to close down Medibank offices. There are 270 Medibank offices across Australia, most of them operating in Medicare offices. Those two services combine. There are economies of scale because of shared expenses. Those who want private health insurance have ready access to Medibank, although at the moment two out of three people in this country are happy with Medicare and do not subscribe to private health insurance. There are economies of scale and benefits to be gained from co-location of both offices. If this government gets its way, only 70 Medibank offices will be left-that is, there will be 200 fewer Medibank outlets. The next thing we are going to hear from this government, if it gets away with that and the legislation gets through, is that Medibank really is not viable and that also ought to be handed back to the private sector. So this afternoon in the grievance that I bring to the parliament I seek to enlist the support of all members to block the closure of Medicare offices across Australia by this government and to drive the message home to the government that these are essential services the community needs for the provision of the health care they use and for access to the pharmaceuticals they need for their illness. I ask the parliament to take that ation. Minister, I will be making further representations to you. I ask you, on behalf of the people I represent, to think again. This is a vital and important community health service that you are seeking to close. I ask you to keep that service operating. (Time expired) Native Title",65
155,Mr TUCKEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My grievance is one of great importance to this parliament and to the people of Australia. It is about how a debate can be distorted by prejudice based on ignorance. For those who occupy this place, be they members of parliament, staff or media, there is no difficulty in getting hold of the issues that relate to the native title debate. The legislation is here, as are the explanatory memoranda and all the competing legal opinions, which, as I pointed out the other day, have only a 50 per cent chance of being right when one considers the performance of lawyers in court. Today things took another step, and in two ways. This morning I heard Laurie Oakes on Channel Nine saying that any suggestion that freehold property could be attacked under the present native title arrangements was a lie because the High Court has said that this could not possibly occur. In an attempt to make that look even better, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) sought today to table a press release by Justice French of the National Native Title Tribunal. He, of course, would be an expert in all of this. He used to be a lawyer in Perth at one stage. I cannot remember anyone telling me in my commercial career, 'You had better get lawyer French. He is the best in the state.' He was just another lawyer. Whilst one can argue that the High Court has spoken on the issue of native title and those forms of title it extinguishes, that is not being supported by reality. Let me read to the House what the High Court said in this regard: The personal rights conferred by common law native title do not constitute an estate or interest in the land itself. They are extinguished by an unqualified grant of an inconsistent estate in the land by the Crown, such as a grant in feeinto considermeaning in fee simpleor a lease conferring the right to exclusive possession. They can also be terminated by other inconsistent dealings with the land by the Crown, such as appropriation, dedication or reservation for an inconsistent public purpose or use, in circumstances giving rise to third party rights or assumed acquiescence. You would say that is pretty clear, and that is everybody's argument. But I would like to bring to the attention of the House today examples within and nearby my electorate of freehold title, of residential exclusive leasehold, that presently not only are under native title claim but also are in the mediation stage. They have been registered by the National Native Title Tribunal. Justice French, who said 'I would never do it' has done it. With the titles I am about to read from-I am prepared to table them if somebody wishes-I have the crown grants. The first was issued to Ray Bevan Willison and Lynette K. Willison. This is what it says on the bottom: The above mentioned grantee is now the registered proprietor of an estate in fee simple in all the land described in this grant. That sounds like freehold to me. These people by their own confirmation to me are currently in a mediation process with the National Native Title Tribunal. Just for the record-I might. add that there are some 30 of these people in this situation-let me read from the crown grant to Dean Kenneth Morgan: The above mentioned grantee is now the registered proprietor of an estate in fee simple in all the land so described. If that is not apiece of freehold, what is? Let me go on from that. There are 36 lots. I have the list here of all the people who are so affected. I hear the shadow minister on the other side saying, 'There j, a reason for this.' That is just what I want to get to. Mr Bevis-That's not what I said. I would be quite happy to follow you in the debate, though.",69
156,Mr TUCKEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I bet you would, and I bet you would give the stupid sorts of reasons that are being given to these poor people who have spent their money and cannot build a house on their block. You are not going to let them. Mr Bevis-Why don't you be honest and responsible?",70
157,Mr TUCKEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"How much more responsible can you be than to produce the documentation-the one thing you failed to do? I challenged you the other day. I said, 'Come back in here and give proof of what you just said,' and you couldn't do it. Let us go to Exmouth. One of the arguments is that it does not matter when freehold was granted; from thereon there is an extinguishment. I want to come to that in terms of the Australian Capital Territory. The Western Australian government resumed land from pastoral leases and granted it in freehold in 1963 to the Commonwealth government. It became part of the defence establishment in Exmouth. On the retirement from that project by the Americans, the Commonwealth government gave that freehold back to the Western Australian government because it had houses on ithouses and Hills hoists, the sorts of things that we are told cannot be challenged under native title rights. Of course, these people turned around and bought these houses because part of the deal with the Commonwealth was that they would be sold off as freehold. That is interesting because a Labor state member, as the minister at the time, issued one of those freeholds. They are freeholds but they are under native title claim. That is the situation. We get to Kalgoorlie, and this is where it gets really interesting because the titles I have here are quite old and, as the evidence shows, some of them have been mortgaged and have changed hands over many years, but they are not freehold. They are long-term, 99-year residential leases but which clearly, as the High Court said, grant exclusive possession. You can find that out pretty easily-try and break in. The reality is that they are under registered native title claim. If they can be under registered native title claim, why cannot all the leases in Canberra? Someone just told me, 'Oh, but they were freehold before they were leasehold,' but that is what applied in Exmouth. It also applied in Kojonup where a solider settler grant was arranged by the Western Australian state government many years ago after the Second World War. It bought freehold farm land and granted it to servicemen, not as freehold but as perpetual lease, because at the time that was way the government handed out all these soldier settlement grants. It is not only under native title claim. In fact, the lady concerned, Marion Wood, wrote to me explaining how she was called to mediation but when she got there-and she had driven a hundred-plus miles from Kojonup to Albany-the lawyer for the Aboriginal interests said, 'I am not ready yet. I am going to take another four months, so you can all go home.' That is another aspect of the present law. It puts an obligation on Mrs Wood, who has got her one-time freehold property that is now under claim, to drive all that distance to negotiate in good faith over what she and her husband might do with that land in the future, but there is no such requirement in the Keating Native Title Act on the Aboriginal interests, and how are they dealing with that? Just like that. That is how they are treating decent people-people who did not go on to that land with a shotgun and a sword and drive the Aboriginal people off-who took up title after the war and were granted it in this format. It is exclusive, all right, and it is one of titles that appears in our schedule, just as the one at Bremer Bay does-the original title that was subdivided there into freehold residential land was conditional-purchase leases which are clearly granting exclusive possession of farm land and which would, according to the High Court, have removed and extinguished the native title. But you are finding all the time that people want to find chinks in the armour. It is a case of when is freehold freehold? You can bet that Slater and Gordon has got a little team of articled clerks working through every freehold title in Sydney and Melbourne, trying to find where someone made a technical mistake. That is why they are under challenge and, if anybody says that these documents are not real, they can bet with me. It will not be the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) who is betting with me because, when it comes to getting up and doing the right thing, he is a bit slow to get off the mark. You can bet me any amount you like if you want to tell me that these are not proper documents. (Time expired) Parliament and the Executive",70
158,Mr FILING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"One of the promises of the coalition government during the election campaign was to raise the standards of parliamentary activity and, in particular, to provide a greater opportunity for parliamentarians to use the forum to properly represent their constituents. Unfortunately, as is often the case-and quite clearly now in historical terms is ever the case-all we have seen is the basic expansion of the power of the executive vis-a-vis the parliament. This is interesting because at one stage I was a chairman of the back bench committee in the coalition on Attorney-General and justice matters and I can recollect a number of members being quite rightly concerned at that time in opposition about the trammelling of the rights of parliamentarians by the executive. I suppose one of the most obvious aspects of that was the signing by Australia of treaties, instruments and agreements without recourse to the parliament-in fact, in instances where parliament would not even know and often neither would citizens unless - he they were taking the trouble to inform themselves, requiring a fair amount of research. I would have thought that it was absolutely imperative, as far as members of this chamber are concerned, to ensure that the rights of members to represent the people who they have been elected to represent are upheld and that they are untrammelled. In fact, I can recollect the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia (Mr Costello) saying in his impressive maiden speech that, in the historic struggle between the parliament and the executive, he was for the parliament. But, in essence, we have seen with his role as the Treasurer basically more of the same sorts of tactics used by the previous government-in particular, the sorts of tactics that made the previous Keating government highly unpopular in the electorate. People did not like the Keating government because they felt it was elitist, that it basically did not take any notice of the views of the general population and that it viewed the parliament's activities as a sort of sideshow, a pantomime where people would come on and have their little bit of say for five to 10 or 20 minutes and then pop off the stage, but no change to the decision making process would occur at all. In some instances, I am sure members would probably feel that they had completely wasted their time when it came to how much of an effect their participation in a particular debate had on the decision making process. In the new year we are going to see the Constitutional Convention take place. It has become known as the constitutional monarchical system versus an Australian republic when, in actual fact, the most serious problem affecting our constitution and our system of governments is not whether or not we are a constitutional monarchy or a republic but whether our system works to properly represent the interests of people. It is my view it does not. In my view, it is basically a tyranny of the executive. Members of parliament, me included, like to come in here and make obvious efforts to change executive government as it moves inexorably towards its next decision. We find the opportunities are very limited indeed. Often the decisions are made long distances from here. As one representing a regional area, such as Western Australia-and, of course, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who is at the table, would know this as a member representing regional Queensland-it is even worse in our position because our geographical isolation from what is considered to be the centre of power and decision making in this country makes it even harder for us to have an active role in influenof cing not only the executive but the parliament, which is dominated by the numbers from Sydney and Melbourne. Paddy O'Brien, a person for whom I have got a great deal of respect, has made the observation that Australia is already in essence a republic in model and that to all intents and purposes the argument over whether we should be a constitutional monarchy or republic is neither here nor there. What is in fact more important is to make the changes necessary to our constitution to make it more answerable to the people, to make it more accountable and to give the representatives of the people more influence on the decision making process-things like fixed term governments, opportunities for citizens' vetoes and citizens' referenda. Importantly, in view of more recent decisions by the High Court, we need a much clearer definition of the role of the High Court in our constitutional system. It is quite clear now that our High Court has taken upon itself a role that, in my view, was never envisaged when the Founding Fathers drew up our constitutional system. In actual fact, in more recent times it has gone not only far beyond the black letter of the law, the constitution but far beyond what most expectations of the High Court ever were. One of the most odious aspects, in my view, of the executive tyranny is its capacity that to make decisions on behalf of the community without recourse to the community. These are the sorts of secret deals and agreements made by small elites supposedly on behalf of the people of Australia. I would have thought that the coalition would fundamentally oppose this approach, given its philosophy and given some of the comments of members of that government in prior times-in particular the person who is now the Treasurer. We should have at least debate on these important matters and some sort of transparency of the deals into which the cabinet gets us. One of the hobbyhorses which I have ridden in more recent times has been the bailout of Thailand and Indonesia, and now with the crisis in South Korea there are the prospects of Australia participating in an international rescue the South Korean economy and the South Korean won. I note an interesting article in the most recent edition of the Economist magazine entitled 'The IMF and Asia', which advises moderation from the IMF. It says in colloquial terms, in terms that a lot of people would understand, that when the South Koreans ring perhaps the IMF ought to hold off answering for a while, because it is clear that the IMF is now being seen as a lending bank of last resort, a sort of Rothwells Bank of the region, to use an unfortunate comparison. This is, in my view, having an adverse effect. The article identified that the size of the economies under threat in the early days of the trouble allowed many to ignore them. We in Australia, it seems, could not. Our government believes that we have become so intimately dependent on their success that not to fall in line and bail out these economies would be fundamentally damaging to our own national interest. This may be right, but the trouble is: who knows? Who has the knowledge or the information on which to base a rational decision? Not us in this chamber. We have not had one statement from the Treasurer, other than a couple of answers to questions. We had a private member's motion, which was given around 20 minutes to deal with what in essence was an extraordinary amount of money committed in the cases of the economies of Thailand and Indonesia. We need answers to questions like these: are we just putting good money after bad? Will the real sources of problems in these economies be dealt with to an extent which will stimulate the kind of growth we need to develop a healthy regional trading system? Let us take the case of Malaysia. We have seen the Prime Minister of Malaysia off on an extraordinary tangent, an anti-Semitic tangent, where he claims that Jews and finanCial speculators are to blame for the Malaysian economy's woes. Then he says that there is a view that capitalism enslaves Asians. The Thais renege on some of the IMF conditions and nothing is done to make them comply. In the case of Mahathir, our own Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), far from actually condemning the comments made by Prime Minister Mahathir which were outrageous under any circumstances, in fact let it slide and said nothing. He was supine. What is our government doing to ensure, firstly, that our resources being applied in these rescue packages will be secure and, secondly, that they will actually be effective? Who knows? Who would know? It certainly has not been made available to this chamber for debate. The two most common threads in the financial troubles in South-East Asia have been described by commentators, including Alan Greenspan, as a lack of transparency in financial dealings and the level of corruption evident in many of the dealings of troubled financial sectors; and the level of Japanese financial support, through bad loans, to these failing economies. The Economist states: Asia's economic problem is acute financial fragility. These are economies that have become accustomed to high rates of growth, an environment wonderfully forgiving of bank lending that is reckless or downright corrupt. . . . Most of the financial mess is of Asia's own making, and nowhere is this clearer than in South Korea. For years, the government has treated the banks of state industrial policy, ordering them to make loans to non-creditworthy companies and industries. Most significant of all, as events may prove, is to contend with a banking system which is rotten to the core. It is becoming clear that a decade of roaring economic growth concealed appallingly sloppy banking practices. The crisis in Asia is a crisis of banking fiduciary responsibility, accountability and transparency of deals. Unfortunately, in dealing with these problems our own cabinet has chosen not to make it transparent. It has chosen to conceal the detail of these deals from the Australian population. It has chosen not to make statements to the Australian population about the true state of affairs, and in essence it is saying 'Steady as she goes' at a time when some are commenting that the wash-out from this crisis in Asia could well affect not only the Australian economy but also the world economy in such a significant way that people who are in the positions of making financial decisions on behalf of their companies and corporations ought to be in a position to know more about the true state of affairs rather than being given a patanswer by not only the Treasurer and cabinet but also unfortunately in this place by the government. Drugs",71
159,Mrs VALE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Initially, I wish to record that I applaud the stand of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his getting tough on drugs campaign and welcome the fact that at last a leader of this country has the courage and fortitude to make a stand on one of the most· serious challenges against the happiness and fulfilment of the lives of many young Australians. In making his strong stand, the Prime Minister is sending out a positive message to our young people to say no to drugs and is providing sound leadership for the youth of the nation at a time when young people often look for guidance from their elders. This is in stark contrast to the useless, failed policy of harm minimisation that has been the government's policy since 1985, which begins with the premise that people are going to take drugs anyway so let us teach young Australians how to take drugs safely as tools and hence minimise the harm drugs may inflict upon them. When the then federal Minister for the Aged, Family and Health  international conference on drug related harm in Melbourne in March 1992, he strongly endorsed the harm reduction approach and came out in an extremely strong way to say that in his view there was no such hope as a drug free society. Strangely, as we have been able to observe over the last few years, this is not the policy used in the very successful anti-tobacco campaign, where total abstinence has been the platform in the full frontal attack in educating young Australians on the dangers of smoking tobacco. As if anyone could smoke tobacco safely. How could any responsible adult even begin to suggest to young people that they can use illicit drugs in safety. My main focus today is to address the concerns expressed to me by many parents in my electorate of Hughes about the way in which the Australian print media has appeared to be biased against those who argue for a policy of total abstinence as a desirable aim in relation to the use of illicit drugs. In my state of New South Wales, the Daily Telegraph and Mr Alan Jones of Radio 2UE have had the courage to take a strong position against harm minimisation. Both have articulated with considerable intellectual force, compassion and plain common sense sound arguments against the failures of the harm minimisation drug strategy. The parents of our young Australians may be interested to learn that in Washington DC in 1992 at the International Conference on Drug Policy Reform, Mr Bill Stronach, the then Executive Director of the Alcohol and Drug Foundation of Victoria, now the Australian Drug Foundation, made some interesting statements about the foundation's use of the media to change public opinion in favour of the foundation's policy of harm minimisation. I quote from his speech at the conference in 1992 where he said: Our foundation believes that if we're going to any significant impact we're going to have to on social and legislative changes and we know quite clearly that the formation of public opinion, and the gathering of information in relation to alcohol and drugs is gained through three main sources. One is the police. Another is alcohol and drug health agencies. But by far the overwhelming source of information which obviously is related to attitudes is the media. And we have focused, as an organisation, quite clearly strategically on the media. He continued and made an alarming statement: · .. we have employed journalists not to chum out press releases but to get in there as subversives and work with their colleagues in the mainstream press. 'Subversives' is the word he used. He continued: · .. and that's been done through developing, very slowly and very gently, a level of trust, a level of credibility. More importantly, the ability to respond because the press want instant answers and they want instant responses. So we have got 24 hours availability of those journalists. And what we're finding now is that in the last eight months, over 50 per cent of the mainstream print, radio and television reporting on alcohol and drug issues has now been generated by the foundation or has been filtered through it. And it's a wonderful opportunity when the press ring up, as they invariably do with some sensational story asking for comment, for us to talk often for an hour and try and tum that around and get the reporting perhaps presented in a different way, because we know that the nature of reporting that we have seen in the past has been sensational, it's been inaccurate, often dangerously inaccurate, and it's always, well not always, but by and large, focussed on those drugs which are illicit and their usage within Australia. He then went on to say: · . . and the harm caused by them is minuscule compared to legal drugs. So we're having a significant impact there, I believe, and I think that's an exciting project. So the thrust of the foundation is to move via the media the public perception which we hope will move towards legislative change in the areas we would see as desirable. With the recent thrust in the print media this year from the drug law reformers who would like to see the decriminalisation of marijuana, heroin trials, shooting galleries and our young people maintained on the drug of their addiction without help or hope for any better future, you can see that this strategy has been have very successful. As a parent, I am concerned focus with the comments by Mr Stronach in 1992 and with the prevailing public perception that has followed. I quote again from his reference in his speech to illicit drugs: ... the harm caused by them is minuscule compared to legal drugs. Perhaps a lot has been learned about the dangers of illicit drugs since 1992. Perhaps today even the Mr Stronachs of the world are better informed. But this is a serious subject, and the taking of illicit drugs has such serious consequences for our children that the parents of Australia have a right to know exactly what illicit drugs can do to their children and their hope for happiness in the future. There is the public perception that the illicit drug marijuana, or cannabis, is soft, safe or even recreational. Nothing could be further from the truth. I quote from one of Australia's leading neuroscientists, John Anderson, Bachelor of Pharmacology, Diploma of Social Science, Master of Literature, MAPsS, consultant psychophysiologist at Neuroscience Psychological Services, Westmead, New South Wales, who tells us about marijuana: ... the areas of the brain which are targeted by the drug are the hippocampus and the cerebellum, the former is concerned with relaying memory consolidation and the latter which controls eqJ.lilibrium and coordination. Young people who use marijuana in their preteens and in their teens are at a great risk of progressing to being dependent on the drug and at a higher risk of using other illegal drugs. As tolerance develops and the drug no longer seems to give the buzz or it is no big deal, it is then just a small step onto the more 'spectacular drugs. What does it mean to have a juvenile stoned on pot? S. Cohen, before the US Senate hearings on the health consequences of marijuana use in 1990 stated: It means that they are losing learning time, growing up time, problem solving time, doing themselves a great disservice, remaining in a state of psychological immaturity, and never learning to cope with the difficulties of life. The professionals call this amotivational syndrome. In the 'Health and Psychological Consequences of Cannabis Use', monograph 25, National Drug Strategy, Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health, Canberra, we were told in 1994: There is sufficient evidence that indicates that cannabis use adversely effects adolescent development. Therefore, it is a desirable goal to discourage its use, especially regular use. While it is still that peer pressure, curiosity and a feeling of rebellion against the establishment contribute to marijuana's popularity, the single most important factor seems to be its intoxicating properties, the altered sense of reality that marijuana creates is pleasurable for some people. What is not known is the price these people may be paying for their pleasure. Teachers in our schools have observed the impact of marijuana use on their students. Vane Tempest, from Teachers Against Drug Abuse, Sutherland, New South Wales in 1994 observed: Students who are marijuana users are often tense, anxious, disruptive, restless, rowdy and given to daydreaming. They skip classes, do not submit easily to homework and try to avoid exams. Some are suspended from school. Others, who previously had good grades start failing or skipping classes as their drug use accelerates. Students who are users are often high before school starts and they tend to lose interest in all aspects of education. If such threats to the physical health and well-being of our young people is not enough to raise the concern of parents, then the devastating effect of marijuana use on the minds of vulnerable young people would be sufficient to worry loving parents in the extreme. In 1982, Professor D.A. Milman of New York University, in his paper 'The Psychological Effects of Cannabis in Adolescents', pointed out: Hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and feelings of depersonalisation and derealisation are not uncommon and are seen in acute intoxicated states as well as acute or chronic psychosis. It is believed that smoking marijuana may trigger an underlying psychosis. A study in Sweden by Allebeck, Anderson and Rydberg reported in the Scandinavian Journal of Social Medicine 1990 and in the Lancet, 26 December 1987, involving over 50,000 people found: ... those who have used cannabis over 50 times have a risk factor of schizophrenia six times greater than non-users. These researchers also found that the proportion of suicides increased sharply with the levels of cannabis consumption. In the American Journal of Diseases of Children, volume 144, March 1990, researchers Berman and Schwartz noted: Substance abuse has been found to be a significant true risk factor in suicide attempts and completed suicides during adolescence. Marijuana and/or hashish was 61 per cent of the drug of choice for abuse. Dr Juan Negrete, at the Second Paris Conference on Cannabis and Cocaine in 1992, warned that: Cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. Clinical and epidemioon logical data suggest that cannabis could act as a trigger, prompting the overt expression of schizophrenia in individuals who suffer the basis of pathological anomalies. Therefore, despite the that schizophrenia may have a genetic basis, the use of marijuana triggers its onset. There are many issues surrounding the debate on appropriate drug policies, but throughout it all it seems to me that parents and young people are not given the full facts or unbiased information about the very real risks of taking illicit drugs, especially marijuana. The policy of harm minimisation sends very wrong messages to our young people that this stuff is not harmful and that, indeed, it is only recreational when it is the opposite that is true. Again, I record my respect of and appreciation to the Daily Telegraph and to Mr Alan Jones of Radio 2UE for their intellectual rigour and judgment, which proved tough enough to withstand the self-professed seduction by the foundation to promote their misguided and failed policy. Very often they have provided the only other easily accessible source of information on this issue that has been available to the parents in my electorate. Greenhouse Gases",73
160,Mrs CROSIO,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Prospect) (5.08 p.m.)There is arguably no issue which is poised to embarrass and marginalise Australia more in the eyes of the international community than the Howard government's current stance on greenhouse gas emissions. In the eyes of our international partners-indeed, in the eyes of ordinary Australians-we are failing in our responsibilities as global citizens with the proposals the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) is taking to the negotiating table at the climate change conference in Kyoto this week. In the past, Australia has built up a well of international goodwill because of our principled and conscientious approach to pressing matters of global importance. Now, faced with an issue which could not be classified as anything but globally significant, we are in the process of squandering that goodwill-and for what? There is not a single sound reason supporting the Howard government's position greenhouse gases and climate change. It ignores the massive weight of evidence on this subject provided by the majority of scientific opinion. It reeks of expediency, of fact improper motives and of vested interests. The scientific model on which the Howard government's greenhouse position is based-a model developed and operated by ABAREhas been strongly criticised by more than 140 Australian economists for its inadequacies. US government experts, whose job is to provide their administration with a similar framework to analyse the pros and cons of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, say that ABARE's modelling completely overestimates the costs involved in strategies aimed at cutting emissions. It fails to assess any benefits from reducing greenhouse pollution, despite the fact that to do nothing, or close to nothing, could cost Australia close to $18 billion a year by 2030. Dr Alan Pears, the author of the federal government's own greenhouse handbook, Global Warming, Cool It, says ABARE's findings are 'Alice in Wonderland stuff'. Dr Pears states: The devastation of the coal industry predicted by the economic models as an outcome of greenhouse response is much overstated. Indeed, the New South Wales state government's Sustainable Energy Development Authority, or SEDA, makes a joke of ABARE's doom and gloom findings. SEDA and the New South Wales state government have stated that not only can New South Wales meet any likely target set by the climate change conference in Kyoto but also it can do so profitably, without the sacrifice of 90,000 jobs and without every person living in the state having $9,000 ripped out of their savings, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has attempted to scaremonger. And let us not forget that New South Wales is more reliant on coal production and coal powered electricity than any other state in Australia. Perhaps more damning of ABARE's findings is that its modelling has been so heavily patronised by the coal and oil industries, which stand to lose the most from any proposal advocating a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. So questionable is the role the fossil fuel industry has played in influencing ABARE's analysis that the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office is currently conducting an inquiry into the co-funding arrangements which have seen ABARE invite private partners to join in the funding and the design of its work. Whatever doubts there are about ABARE's modelling, it has proven successful in persuading the Prime Minister on this issue, as has the lobbying of Sir John Carrick and the head of the Prime Minister's local Liberal Party branch, Mr Robert Vincin. It was these two gentlemen who organised a grab bag of scientists and financiers to confront the Prime Minister and steer his position on greenhouse gas emissions to one which suited them and their vested interests. The success of Carrick and Vincin in convincing the Prime Minister over global warming paints a sorry picture of a leader who is more willing to listen to the sweet nothings of his friends than the cold hard facts. It speaks volumes that we now have a Prime Minister who is happy to listen to his political brothers in arms but who does not bother consulting the head of the CSIRO's Division of Atmospheric Research, Dr Graerne Pearman, when deciding on the nation's position on greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike the Prime Minister, the vast majority of scientists are not as easily swayed by the arguments of the fossil fuel industry. The majority of scientists around the world agrees that the average temperature of the earth has increased 0.5 degrees Celsius since the last century and will continue to rise by between one and 3.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. Indeed, just last week the British Meteorological Office declared that 1997 will be the world's hottest year on record. It will be approximateof ly 0.43 degrees Celsius warmer in 1997 than the long-term average measured over the years 1961 to 1990. So far, the five warmest years on record have occurred in the 1990s. Based on the rate the world's temperature is accelerating, the earth is warming more quickly than at any time over the past 10,000 years. Dr Geoff Jenkins, who is head of the climate prediction program which made that discovery, said: There is a good reason to suggest that part of this is due to human activity, for example emissions from power stations, and the evidence is building. This latest evidence just adds to the mountain of proof we already have now at our fingertips. In 1995, 2,500 of the world's leading experts on climate change put their names to the second assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, which found that not only was the earth heating up but also man had a considerable case to answer for that increase in temperature. The former Chair of the IPCC, Professor Bert Bolin of Stockholm University, writing in the United Nations' environmental magazine, Our Planet, had this to say about the recalcitrant scientists and countries which refuse to admit that global warming is a very serious reality-and it reflects badly on the line currently being pushed by the Howard government and its friends in the fossil fuel industry: The basis of the criticism is meagre and sometimes simply scientifically incorrect. Some of these efforts stem from countries and groups whose economies depend in a major way on the continued use of fossil fuels, the source of much of the greenhouse gas emissions. The Australian people can also recognise what is at stake here. At the very least it is the damage to our international reputation; at worse it is that, by our reluctance to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to our fullest capacity, we provide other nations with an opportunity to follow our poor lead and to also not live up to their responsibilities. According to the latest Sydney Morning Herald AC Neilsen-MCNair poll, 90 per cent Australians are concerned or very concerned about the impact of global warming, 83 per cent believe that global warming is a serious threat to humans and the environment, 79 per cent feel that Australia should join other developed nations in signing a treaty to cut greenhouse gas emissions and 68 per cent say that the Howard government's concern that a treaty will cause Australia to suffer economically should not stop it signing the treaty. The Christopher Pearsons and Peter Walshes of this world argue that because Australia is not facing any sort of apocalypse-because the end of the world is not nigh-why should we bother about cutting our emissions? Why should anyone bother? They, along with a few others, have attempted to foster doubts in the minds of Australians that the issues of global warming and greenhouse gases are the equivalent of a scientific sideshow, and that there is no hard evidence to suggest man has had any influence on global temperature change. I remember hearing similar arguments from the tobacco industry when the medical establishment brought out the mountains of evidence linking lung cancer with smoking. Look at the immeasurable damage that has occurred because of that self-serving and irresponsible denial which was circulated around the world. As journalist Brian Toohey noted in one of his recent articles on climate change 'isolationism ... is rarely a good option'-yet isolationism seems to dominate the Howard government's thinking on this issue. The Prime Minister's position ignores the one basic truth about the issue of greenhouse gases and global warming: Australia cannot isolate itself from the environmental fallout should we fail to play our part in reducing emissions and helping to control climate change. The basic truth is that we will all be affected by global warming, and it is from that truth that our policy should and must proceed. The fact that it does not means it will remain fundamentally flawed. We, as well as future populations, will either celebrate or suffer from the effects of the decisions made in Kyoto this week. The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and the Howard government are strongly denying that there will be any effect on our environment by greenhouse gases, and that we in Australia do not cause any of that. I completely deny his statements that the cost in jobs in cutting emissions has to be enormous. In a debate like this, which is affecting the rest of the world, we should be basin'g our debate on scientific facts and not on someone's dreamtime. (Time expired) Neem Products",76
161,Mr CAUSLEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I grieve this afternoon on behalf of a constituent, Mr Joe Friend, from The Channon, near Lismore. Mr Friend has a keen interest in the biological qualities of the neem tree. Neem is a tree species-its Latin name is Azadirachta indica-that has been planted in northern Australia since about 1940. References to the use of neem in this country are to be found in articles in the Sydney Mail in 1882 and The Northern Star in 1883, and the oldest known use of neem was for pest control in wheat. Neem leaf was reported to efficiently control the common wheat weevil of stored grain in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales. Neem products include neem cake, which is a valuable soil fertiliser, neem oil from the seeds and bark, neem leaf for certain insects and medicinals, and neem seed extracts for certain New-Age botanical pesticides that are safer than pyrethrum. In Australia there are at least six companies actively researching, exporting and importing neem products, and they grow neem trees right across northern Australia, from the Northern Rivers region to Perth. At least three companies dealing with neem products and gas their manufacture are located in the Lismore region, with two more in the Gold Coast and Brisbane districts. Many other small businesses are directly connected to the wholesaling and retailing of neem trees to farms and farmers across the top half of Queensland and Western Australia, as well as the Northern Territory. After eight or nine years of considerable and deepening interest, as well as education of the public about the medicinal find pesticidal qualities of the neem tree, one would expect that federal authorities would be eager to foster and stimulate the further progress and development of new neem businesses arising in Australia. Sadly, to date this is the opposite of what has happened with our pharmaceutical and primary industry registration authorities in Canberra. Aft e r over five years of attempts and trying times for Northern Rivers businesses, federal authorities-especially the National Registration Authority-remain almost intransigent in regard to registering neem products for use in Australian agriculture. Registration simply has not occurred, and there appears to be no satisfactory reason why this is so. The National Registration Authority appears to have been advised that there are some potential public safety risks with neem products. However, no such risk has been stated by any toxicologist, and nil evidence has been furnished by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to attest to the alleged risk associated with neem products, if and where used in agriculture. On the other side of the world, America is moving fast to take a good slice of the world's clean produce market. Neem-clean pesticides, including the world's first fully registered neem extract for use in crops for human consumption, were registered on a priority basis back in 1992 and 1993. Here in Australia we have lost the chance to have the world's most environmentally sound pesticide placed into common usage. Clean, non-polluted farm produce is now in big demand in the Northern Hemisphere, and we could be helping to supply that demand. Without registered, certified, safe and effective farm chemicals like neem extract and, to some extent, neem oil, we will continue to fall behind in our ability to supply clean, quality assured, non-polluted and chemical free foodstuffs. Because the NRA and TGA authorities and bureaucrats in Canberra refuse to properly or professionally discuss the complex organic chemistry of the neem tree, and the products made from it, our country's economic future in this ethical direction is being put in jeopartration dy. To date, this problem has been going on for four or more years, and it does not look like going away, in spite of a lot of lobbying for change. The problems appear to be many, varied and, to some extent, systemic in the nature of the way the NRA was set up in 1993-94 and with the close association that the NRA enjoys with its sister organisation in Canberra, the TGA. In summary form, the problems perceived to exist and co-exist between the NRA and the TGA are as follows. Firstly, the TGA is supposed to provide independent toxicological advice to the NRA about chemical products being presented for registration by the NRA. However, because of the close, ongoing association, and regular dialogue between the NRA and TGA officials at various levels, there is no guaranteed independence of expert technical opinion that might be given by the TGA; that is, the TGA is not sufficiently independent of the NRA in order to be capable of providing an expert technical opinion that is professionally and totally independent. Secondly, to date, whereas the NRA approves for registration product labels without warnings for certain chemicals and indications against certain usages, such as malathion, for example-which is not supposed to be used anywhere near or on the skin of humans-the TGA has for years allowed the ongoing application of concentrated malathion to the skin of humans, and not just any humans but onto children's scalps. This is inconsistent and does not make a lot of sense. It certainly goes against the grain and the spirit of the federal government's supposed precautionary principle that this government agreed to put into practice and putits signature to at the Rio convention on the earth's environment. Thirdly, there is the issue of policy and fast-tracking. It is reported that the NRA has commenced to move faster with registrations and re-registrations of numerous new and existing chemicals, some of them on a so called fast-track basis, according to reports received direct from officers working at the NRA. This in effect means that some chemicals are being fast-tracked towards full regisand ultimate approval by Canberra, whilst others are not. There appears to be no governing policy to allow this chemical discrimination to occur. In fact, one investigator reports that there appears to be no factual environmental policy in the NRA, so that chemicals which might have serious negative impacts on the environment are perhaps the ones getting fast-tracked at present. Why? Because the NRA was set up to bea money raising organisation to pay for its own bureaucracy, which means that the more that certain corporations pay to have a chemical fast-tracked, the more likely it is to get approved. This represents, by default, of course, a form of corruption that is creeping into the powers that be in Canberra. In this case, the NRA knows that they can get away with this form of rule bending since, in the recently determined and notorious Helix case of farm produce pollution by one such chemical, the High Court determined that the NRA was immune from any legal challenge or class action by public citizens or groups. A recent example of one such chemical that has been carefully fast-tracked for application to humans is ivermectin for the control of certain types of scabies in tropical Australia. Yet it is well known in the bush that this same complex organic chemical can and has killed prize bulls when applied as a 'tickicide' on grazing properties. The NRA and TGA have ignored this vital local knowledge, no doubt in part because of a proclivity towards staying in office in their ivory towers. Mr Friend believes that Australian soils deserve much better treatment than they are currently getting from the whole raft and swag of toxic synthetic chemicals now being put on and into the topsoil, once upon a time the domain of the world's greatest known microbiological diversity. Most chemical pesticides are acidifying in the way they work and break down; this means that our notoriously acid soils only get worse-more and more acid. This is wrong. On top of this, the sustained regular or repetitive use of foreign chemicals is almost certainly reducing the microbial biodiversity of our soils. Together, these comprise a borderline criminal situation that must be changed. In fact, neem products are scientifically proven to be safe and good for the soil environment-acidification is rectified, and soil microbial biodiversity can be rebuilt. The NRA and the TGA have not realised any of this because neither organisation employs a soil scientist or anyone with vaguely similar qualifications. Australian soils are worse off as a result of this. In part, this is the result of the whittling away of the CSIRO through the entire same period of NRA's rise to ascendancy. Yet, when the NRA came into being, we all expected better than we got. It seems that all we got instead was more of the same-like a roll-out from the previous Labor government. In spite of the good intentions of some grassroots environmental activists via the community consultative committee to the NRA, there has been nil fundamental change to the status quo supporting large multinational chemical companies in this country. They still go on distributing ever more new chemicals, and not being stimulated to look for viable, safer alternatives to the old poisons of yesteryear. Small business that is proudly looking towards a brighter, safer future for our polluted environment is not getting a decent go in this country. New Australian businesses have been trying to get ahead with neem products, but all they seem to get from Canberra authorities is a very plain set of excuses for continuing to favour the bigger offshore companies that can afford to support the NRA in the style to which it has become accustomed. One company from Lismore applied to register its neem pesticide product in 1994, but it was knocked back by the NRA, in league with the TGA.",78

164,Mr SPEAKER,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"It is my duty to make a short statement to the House concerning the Senate proposals with respect to this bill, and the matters of constitutional principle that they raise. It appears that proposed changes (5) and (8) will, if enacted, have the effect of increasing the expenditure under the standing appropriation in the principal act. Purported amendments (2) to (4), (6) and (7) and (9) are consequential to (5) and (8). The change proposed by the Senate, which is numbered (12), with (1), which is consequential, would create a discretionary power to increase expenditure under a standing appropriation. The increase would be a legally possible, probable and expected increase in expenditure. There is significant doubt that the Senate may proceed in such circumstances by way of amendment ·because of the requirements of section 53 of the constitution. A more appropriate way to proceed would be by way of a request for amendment. However, the purported amendments raise an additional important point of constitutional principle. Section 56 of the constitution provides that a vote, resolution or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue shall not be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of the Governor General to the house in which the proposal originated. House standing orders 297 and 298 are complementary to section 56, and provide for messages from the Governor General recommending an appropriation for the purposes of, or in relation to, amendments or requests to be announced before the amendment is moved .or considered. It is my belief that certain of the purported amendments would increase expenditure under the appropriation, as I noted earlier. My belief is supported by legal opinion. No message has been reported in respect of the purported Senate amendments. In fact, a message could not be reported relating to a Senate amendment-only for Senate requests for amendment. In light of this, the matter for consideration becomes not so much the privileges and rights as between the two houses but observance of the requirements of the constitution concerning the appropriation of revenue. Where there is a possibility of certain sections of the constitution being considered to be matters on which courts might not make a pronouncement, there is an obligation on all involved in the parliamentary process to ensure that constitutional propriety is observed. Of course, it is for the House itself to decide what action to take in respect of the matter.",81
165,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION," Mr Speaker, thank you very much for the important statement that you have made to the House today. I move: That the House endorses the statement of the S-eaker in relation to the constitutional questions raIsed b.y mess-ge No. 341 transmitted by the Senate In relatIOn to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill 1997. The amendments that the Senate has purported to make fall into three groups. The first group is the assets test amendments. Amendments (1) and (12) relate to the exemption of certain superannuation investments from the social security assets test. Amendment (12) provides further scope for exempting such investments, which will both expand the cl-ss of - eople entitled to social security benefIts and Increase the benefits payable to some existing recipients. Amendment (1) is consequential to amendment (12). The second group is the family payment amendments. Amendments (2) to (9) relate to entitlements to family payments for children who are overseas. Amendments (5) and (8) narrow the Circumstances in which family payments will be reduced because children are overseas, thus increasing the class of people who will continue to receive family payments at higher rates. Amendments (2) to (4), (6), (7) and (9) are consequential upon amendments (5) and (8). The third group is the rent assistance amendments. Amendments (10) and (11) relate to the rent assistance entitlements of people who are paying government rent. The bill would reduce the class of tenants who are entitled to rent assistance and the amendments would expand the class, although the class would still remain smaller than the class of people who are currently entitled to rent assistance. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that amendments (5), (8) and (12) should have been moved in the Senate as requests, and require the Governor General's messages in accordance with section 56 of the constitution. On several occasions in the recent past, the Senate has passed amendments which, in the view of the government, should have been moved as requests for amendments in accordance with the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. In the belief that the requirements of section 53 are matters to be negotiated between the two houses and to avoid delaying the business of the parliament with procedural debates, the House has commonly accepted the Senate's amendments in such cases, although the House's views have often been expressed from the chair. However, in this case, we are dealing with different matters .. The government's advice on this bill is not only that the amendments should have been moved in the Senate as requests for amendments but also that the amendments concerned should not have been made at all before the House was informed of the Governor General's message recommending the purpose of the necessary appropriations. The government's view is that the section 56 requirement for the Governor General's message cannot be dismissed as a mere procedural matter. It is fundamental to the preservation of the financial initiative of the executive government. Accordingly, even though we will be accepting all the changes contained in the Senate amendments, we will move that the House reject Senate amendments (5), (8) and (12)-which were made without a Governor General's message-and the amendments consequential to those amendments on the grounds that they should have been moved as requests. The House will then receive the Governor General's message, and we will move amendments to the bill in identical terms to those rejected in the Senate form. If these amendments are passed, the bill will be returned to the Senate in the form sought by the Senate. We would expect that the Senate would then agree to the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative.",82
166,Mr SPEAKER,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I understand that it is the wish of the House to consider first the Senate's purported amendments (1) to (9) and (12) and, when those purported amendments have been disposed of, to consider amendments (10) and (11).",83

(4) A determination under subsection (2) takes effect on the day on which it is made or on such other day (whether earlier or later) as is specified in the determination. As I indicated earlier, the amendments that the Senate sought to make to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill 1997 are divided into three areas. First was an amendment requested by the government to give the Minister for Social Security a broader discretion to exempt on hardship grounds holders of superannuation assets from the operations of the assets test. The minister already has a broad discretion under the income test but not the assets test. This amendment removes that anomaly. Second, the government inherited a Social Security Act which denied more than the minimum family payment to a child going overseas even for an operation or a school trip. In this bill, we sought to make this fairer by allowing kids to be overseas for eight weeks and still receive full family payment. We balanced this by bringing back the amount of time parents could be overseas from 13 weeks to eight weeks. The Senate amended this fair compromise by giving both children and parents up to 13 weeks overseas. We still believe that eight weeks was a fair balance, but we have accepted the amendment. I will speak to the third matter at a later point when we deal with amendments 10 and 11. Amendments agreed to.",83
169,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I move: That Senate amendments Nos 10 and 11 be agreed to. This matter relates to rent assistance paid to subtenants in public housing. At the moment they receive a double subsidy from the taxpayer. First, they receive rent assistance of up to $100 per fortnight. Second, their accommodation receives a substantial subsidy from a state housing authority. No other Australian tenants receive such a double subsidy. It is unfair to public housing tenants, private tenants and taxpayers alike. Despite this, the Senate has sought an amendment to the government's measure. The government will reluctantly accept this amendment for two reasons. The first is that there are other vital measures in the bill that will be held up if it does not pass. The second is that the measure, as amended, will allow the government to collect more detailed data confirming the extent of this double subsidy problem. We will use this data to bring back these reforms to the Senate at a later point in time. We will be encouraging the Senate to pass them unamended.",84
170,Ms MACKLIN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"In relation to amendment No. 10, the opposition is pleased that the government is accepting our amendment on this matter. It is important to draw the attention of the House to the substance of the amendment. We are not seeking to enable anybody to get a double subsidy, as I am sure the minister is aware. It is very important that that not happen. As the minister has indicated to the House, the government does not have any idea how many people are in the category of being sub letters in public housing. When questions were asked in Senate estimates about the government's knowledge of this matter, no information was forthcoming. So it is very important that we understand the nature of the problem before enacting significant changes. It is the case that, if this measure had gone ahead, families could have been disadvantaged. Where people who collect rent assistance notify, probably through their parents, the state housing authorities that they are in receipt of rent assistance, it could be that subsequent to that their parents' rent would go up. The government needs to provide evidence of the existence of a double subsidy before asserting it and trying to bring in changes to the legislation. As I said, we are pleased that the government has accepted the opposition's amendments. Already people in public housing are doing it very hard as a result of a number of changes this government has already introduced. We know that, under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, there have been significant cuts in the last budget to the building of new public housing around Australia. We also know that people in public housing are facing a considerable period of uncertainty because this government is unable to negotiate a new Commonwealth-state housing agreement. Since the government came to power, it has had no success whatsoever in negotiating a new Commonwealth-state housing agreement. This is putting enormous pressure and uncertainty on people in public housing. At least this small measure will relieve that uncertainty to some degree. What we would hope to see, however, is the government taking swift action to get a new Commonwealth-state housing agreement negotiated so that the states can get on with building the houses that are much needed and so that those who need to live in public housing can have the security of knowing that housing will be there when they need it. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT (PARENTING AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1997 Consideration of Senate Message Consideration resumed from 27 October.

171,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Berowra-Minister for rea- Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (5.43 p.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I note that the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997, as introduced, has provided for a limitation on the payment of arrears of child disability allowance instead of the existing 12-month period. The Senate agreed to amendments moved jointly by the opposition and the Australian Democrats to oppose the six-month limitation period and so maintain a 12-month period. The government still considers that a six-month period is reasonable for arrears of child disability allowance rea- claims. However, in the interests of securing the passage of this bill and the important measures contained in it, the government will reluctantly maintain the current 12-month arrears period. Schedule 4 of the parenting bill provides for the application of consistent hardship rules to ordinary waiting periods, the liquid assets waiting period and the income maintenance period. The key concept in these hardship rules is the requirement that, before the waiting periods may be waived, the person must be in severe financial hardship. In addition, the reason why the person is in such hardship is that the person was forced to undertake unavoidable and essential expenditure. The Democrats moved amendments to schedule 4 in the Senate to the effect that the phrase 'unavoidable and essential' was replaced with 'unavoidable or reasonable' expenditure. These amendments were unanimously accepted by the Senate. The government recommends that the House agree to the amendments proposed by the Senate.",108
172,Ms MACKLIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I too just want to say a few brief words on the child disability allowance. We are pleased that rea- the government has accepted the opposition's amendments to keep the arrears period for the child disability allowance at 12 months rather than six months. Members might recall that the government has already tried to reduce the arrears period once and had to accept the opposition's amendment on that occasion as well. They tried to reduce the arrears period from 12 months to three months last year. That was defeated. The government came back again to try to reduce it from 12 months to six months. It has been defeated again. Let us hope that the government realises that the reason the arrears period keeps getting defeated is because the opposition is very concerned that parents do take a considerable period of time to come to terms with the fact that they have a child with a disability and all the extra work and responsibility that that entails. In addition, there is the time taken to actually have the child assessed and diagnosed. To expect the parents in that situation to get it all done in three months, as was the government's original intention, or in six months, was unreasonable as far as Labor was concerned. We are very pleased to see the government accepting those amendments. I hope we will not have to have this debate for a third time. I hope that the government recognises that parents who have children with disabilities are under enormous pressure and do not need to be put under more pressure than they have already been put under by this government. It is not only the child disability allowance that is putting parents who have children with disabilities under pressure; there are major changes to the new mobility allowance rules which mean that people with disabilities are finding it harder to engage in training and day acti vities. We still have a government that is unable to negotiate a new Commonwealth-state disability agreement. In fact, Commonwealth and state ministers met again on Friday and were yet again unable to come to any agreement about a Commonwealth-state disability agreement. The reason they cannot come to any agreement is because this government has only one objective, which is to cut the funding to people with disabilities. The government is continuing the Commonwealth-state disability agreement on a month-by-month agreement. This is putting people with disabilities and families with children who have disabilities at considerable risk because they do not know whether the services that they need will be available to them. The government has made a decent change here in this social security legislation to recognise the need for parents to be able to claim their child disability allowance 12 months in arrears. I would also say to them that young people and other people needing to get to training and day activities also need a mobility allowance. Everybody who has a disability needs to have some certainty. The government should act immediately to negotiate with the states a new Commonwealth-state disability allowance. That might then end the raft of bad news that this .country has had from the Howard government's approach to people with disabilities. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA BILL (No.6) 1997 Cognate bill: NA BILL (No.2) 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 November, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time.",108
173,Mr ROCHER,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"At the outset, I want to observe that the people responsible for proposing and agreeing to these bills being debated cognately must be off with the fairies. As a consequence of the lack of time to consider the measures in any depth at all during the second reading debate, my remarks during this second reading debate will be confined to the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997. I will, however, take the opportunity during the consideration in detail stage to comment at some length on the couple of schedules I have had the time to digest as they appear in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) 1997. I might add that I will also add another schedule just to make it an even 11-a baker's dozen-by proposing an amendment of my own. The principle of the low income exemption threshold was incorporated in the original Medicare levy package way back in 1984 and is designed to ensure that low income individuals and families are not liable to pay the Medicare levy. The measures contained in this bill merely seek to increase the threshold by amounts in line with increases in the consumer price index with the new threshold amounts coming into effect in the 1997-98 financial year. It is interesting to government is prepared to adjust this threshold to better align it with the CPI, given its reluctance to do the same with the provisional tax uplift factor. Such are the vagaries of contemporary political life, I suppose. The exemption of low income earners from the Medicare levy is both fair and reasonable. However, it is pertinent that the increases proposed in this bill be seen in the context of the overall increases in the costs of our public health care system. While the increases in the low income threshold are modest, there is nothing conservative about the growth in total health care outlays, which far exceeds movements in the CPI. Prior to release of the government's publication entitled Financial Statements of the Commonwealth Government of Australia for the year ending 30 June 1996, the most reliable information from the Department of Finance showed that the Medicare levy would raise $3.4 billion in the year 1995-96. Compare this with a total national health bill of more than $18 billion in the same period and it becomes glaringly obvious that the Medicare levy goes nowhere near meeting the real costs of our health care programs and systems. The total dearth of transparency in the cost of Medicare should be of concern to all in this place. During the debate on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1996, I proposed that taxpayers should be made aware of their real contribution to the nation's Medicare bill. I specifically used the word 'real' because, in the wider community, the perception persists that the Medicare levy reflects the true cost of Medicare outlays and expenditures. As I have previously demonstrated, there is absolutely no parity between the two. It is no wonder, then, that the Productivity Commission, in its 1997 report into Australian health care, variously described the system as 'disparate' note that the and 'poorly coordinated'. In the past, I have referred to the mentality amongst many taxpayers that either because the Medicare levy is compulsory it is all the individuals need to pay to provide for the cost of their health care or because the amount of money conscripted by way of the levy is perceived to be so high there need be no further contributions by individuals to the cost of their personal health care. The fact is that the government must take a hard-nosed response to redressing the imbalance between revenue and outlays on health and increase the Medicare levy to a level commensurate with either total health expenditure or, at the very least, to the extent necessary to pay the cost of Medicare. Of course, such an increase should be accompanied by a compensating decrease in the marginal income tax rates so that the aggregate tax take is preserved. Rather than adopting policies and practices which would facilitate a better understanding of the health funding crisis that lies in wait, the coalition has actually exacerbated the problem by failing to differentiate the Medicare levy in recent fiscal papers. I think it is appropriate at this time to seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table which I have taken the precaution of circulating widely. Leave granted. The table read as followsCANBERRA TAXES IN 1996-97 AND 1997-98 Revenue Item actual**($m) Taxation on individualsGross PAYE 53302 Other 9538 Medicare Levy 3350 Gross prescribed pay- 2059 ments system Less Refunds -7835 Total Individual Tax 60414 Taxation on companiesIncome Tax 18252 Withholding Tax 1349 Superannuation funds 1634 tax Petroleum resources 791 rent tax Fringe Benefits tax 3031 Total Company tax 25057 Total Income Tax 85470 Other taxesSales tax 12955 Excise dutyCrude oil, LPG, pet- 10238 roleum Other 2612 Customs dutyImports 3124 Other taxes, fees and 1960 fines Total indirect tax 30889 Total Taxation Rev- 116359 enue Non tax revenueInterest 1403 Dividends and other 3899 Total non-tax revenue 5302 Total Revenue 121660 *Source: Budget Statements 1996-97, Budget Paper No.1 Page 4-28 Budget Statements 1997-98, Budget Paper No.1 Page 5-3 **Some totals for 1996-97 do not add up, probably figures ****Medicare levy no longer differentiated",109
174,Mr ROCHER,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I have already referred to th- release of the Financial Statements of the Commonwealth Government of Australia for the year ending 30 June 1996. Prior to the release of that document, it was standard procedure to show separately the revenue raised by way of the Medicare levy as a distinct part of the total tax take from the full range of taxation measures.

In August 1995, the magazine Personal Investment proposed that-and it is not my language; I am quoting: The only way Medicare's costs can be controlled in the larger term is to make each individual a little more responsible for their longer term own health costs. While medical and tax experts agree that consumers require a greater appreciation of the shortfall that exists between revenue raised by way of the Medicare levy and actual national health costs, the government has made it more difficult to get this message across. The Australian people should be made aware of the lack of symmetry between the Medicare levy and the costs to taxpayers of pharmaceuticals, doctors and hospitals. Now, however, there is absolutely no way of calculating the total estimated revenue raised from the Medicare levy for the year 1996-97 from the recent Department of Finance figures. That is totally unacceptable. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) was supposedly all for open and transparent account keeping when he introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 into this place only last year. It appears that he is now nonplussed about ensuring that the government meets the very standards it claims to have set for itself. This bill will see the Medicare levy low incomes threshold increase to $13,389 for individuals and to $22,594 for couples and sole parents in the 1997-98 year. Accordingly, anyone who receives a full single aged pension of $347.80 a fortnight or those aged pensioner couples getting the full combined amount of $580.20 are exempt from paying the Medicare levy. Official data demonstrates that one of the most significant trends emerging in Australian demographics is the increase in the size and the proportion of the elderly population. Our aging population is expected to have a devastating effect on our national health care programs. Contributing to this effect is the fact that the number of aged persons who will be exempt from paying the Medicare levy will increase disproportionately over the coming decades. In its current format, Medicare is reliant on the taxpayer to provide a lot of the revenue needed for its survival. But, with our population aging, there will be fewer participants in the paid work force relative to the growing number of retirees. The Institute of Family Studies found that, by the year 2041, 36 senior citizens and 29 children will be dependent on every 100 persons of work force age-that is, 35 per cent of our future population will bear the responsibility for the care of the remaining 65 per cent unless measures are taken pretty soon. Despite various attempts to increase the level of national savings, our household savings as a percentage of disposable income have declined significantly during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1979 Australia's household savings rate sat at 12.3 per cent of total disposable income, which placed us in 12th position in comparison with 20 other OECD nations. By 1996 our household savings rate had diminished to only 4.2 per cent of disposable income, and we had dropped down to 17th on the OECD table. In other words, a growing number of Australians remain indifferent to providing for themselves in retirement and for their health care costs and are instead content to rely on a taxpayer funded pension. Coupled with this is the corresponding decrease in the number of Australians who are taking out and maintaining private health insurance. As was highlighted in the August 1995 edition of Personal Investment, Medicare was originally intended to 'co-exist' with private health insurance, with the latter acting as a kind of relief valve for Medicare. What has developed of course is very different. Whereas 50 per cent of Australians were covered by some form of private health cover in 1984, only one in three are now privately insured. As a result, the Commonwealth and states now fund 80 per cent of the expenditure on medical services and public hospitals, while private health insurance now accounts for only 11 per cent. In 1995 the elderly accounted for approximately one-third of our national expenditure on health care, but it is expected that this figure will climb to more than 50 per cent within the next 50 years. Our aging population means that a greater proportion of older Australians will place greater demands on Medicare in future-particularly if the drop in private health insurance is not reversed-and that this increase in costs will have to be met by fewer working taxpaying Australians. Also, as the number of older Australians who will be reliant on an age pension and therefore exempt from paying the Medicare levy increases in future, the tax base required to support Medicare will continue to shrink. The Australian Institute of Family Studies, in its 1997 report entitled Australian Family Profiles, noted that the number of people aged 65 years and over is projected to more than double, from 2.15 million in 1995 to 5.48 million in the year 2041. As at June 1997, Department of Social Security and Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed that, of the 2.48 million Australians over the age of 65, only 500,000 of them are self-funded retirees. Put another way, fewer than one in four retired Australians are not reliant on a publicly funded pension at present. If this trend continues, more than four million aged Australians will be exempt from paying the Medicare levy by the year 2041. Of course, the number of people who are not obliged to pay the Medicare levy is actually much higher than this because persons receiving a full sole parent pension also qualify for exemption from the levy. In 1995 just under 325,000 people were in receipt of the sole parent pension. This number is expected to climb owing to an increasing divorce rate and an increase in the number of women who have children while never having been married. While these low income earners should continue to be exempt from paying the Medicare levy, it is critical that the exemption be seen as part of the overall problem of funding our public health care system. Treasury has estimated that the cost to revenue to increase the threshold as proposed in this bill is $74 million over the next four years. That is a substantial cost to the taxpayer and one which can only increase in the coming years. Continuous debt accumulation, which future generations will have to pay off, is an issue of such importance that it needs to be tackled in a realistic fashion and in the immediate future. One of the more perplexing aspects of the Medicare levy exemption threshold is its interaction with the newly created Medicare levy surcharge. Members will know that the latter was announced by the government in its 1996-97 budget and sees an additional one per cent Medicare surcharge for individuals earning in excess of $50,000 per annum and couples and families with a combined taxable income in excess of $100,000 if they do not have private health insurance. This bill seeks to amend sections 8D and 8G of the act to raise the threshold to exempt a family member with low income from liability for the Medicare levy surcharge. For instance, in the case where one member of a couple earns $13,000 per annum and the other member earns $88,000 per annum, hence providing a combined income of just above the surcharge exemption threshold of $100,000 per annum, only the latter will be liable to pay the additional one per cent levy surcharge if he or she does not have private health insurance. The former will be exempt from paying the Medicare levy surcharge as well as the Medicare levy because his or her income falls below the new Medicare levy threshold amount of $13,389 per annum. The sole purpose in providing a Medicare levy exemption threshold is to benefit low income individuals and families. It seems to me that a shortcoming of the principal act is that it allows someone to benefit from the non-payment of the Medicare levy because his or her earnings fall below the threshold amount even though the combined family income may be in excess of $100,000. It is right and reasonable to expect that those who can afford to pay for their own health care, including making a contribution to the Medicare levy, should be expected to do so.· As one analyst recently noted, there is simply no sustainable solution that does not involve people who can afford to do so paying more of their own health care. Equally perplexing is the manner in which the interaction between the two Medicare levies is clarified-although I use the word 'clarified' rather loosely-in the explanatory memorandum. What is the point of having an explanatory memorandum if it fails to explain in lay terms the specific amendments being sought in the legislation? There is absolutely nothing plain or intelligible in the section of the explanatory memorandum that deals with the correlation between the Medicare levy exemption threshold and the Medicare levy surcharge exemption threshold. This government is supposedly committed to the tax law improvement project. It has opted to continue funding the project, which has cost more than $4 million already and countless man hours, the end result being a supposedly more simple and straightforward reading tax act. If the current rate of progress is anything to go by, it will be another 25 to 30 years before the rewrite is complete, and that does not take into account the time that will be necessary to simplify the complicated language in the accompanying memorandum to this bill. In commenting on the complex nature of recent amendments to the capital gains tax rollover, the President of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, Mr Graeme Samuel, had this to say: Why does the Tax Office invest millions of dollars in a tax law improvement project if it cannot staunch the flow of legislative gobbledegook in one particular amendment? The same question could be asked in this instance. Australia is not alone in spending an increasingly large share of its gross domestic product on health care. The United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, West Germany and a host of other nations are currently facing similar cost problems. As in Australia, the health system in each of those countries is characterised by the increasing inability or, more accurately, unwmingness of consumers to pay for so much expensive health care, according to a report recently produced by the Institute of American Universities. The critical first step in controlling expenditure in health care is to make the community better aware of the true cost involved. A better aligned Medicare levy is essential to achieving that.

175,Mr BRADFORD,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I was enjoying the speech of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). It is a pity that he did not have a little more time to finish. I think he was about to make some very good points, although indeed he did so during his contribution. He always makes a good contribution in this place. I think he is something of a loss to the Liberal Party, but I am sure that the government will take note of the remarks that he has made. I will not attempt to emulate the member for Curtin with detailed comments about these pieces of legislation, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bm (No.2). I wanted to concern myself with only one or two aspects of the legislation. The honourable member talked about the explanatory memorandum. I have often wondered whether that was a misdescription of these documents. Like him, for years I have been trying to use them to understand what the legislation is all about and I have always found them more difficult to understand than the legislation itself. Mr Miles-Maybe it is a literacy test for you.",114
176,Mr BRADFORD,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Maybe it is something of a literacy test. In any case, I am referring to the explanatory memorandum to this legislation, which deals with a number of matters. As the member for Curtin also said, being critical, I suppose, of the governmentbut I am sure it is criticism that is recognised-we do have an enormously complex tax system. This legislation just adds to the thousands of pages of tax legislation and creates work for accountants trying to understand them. That underlines the need for reform of our tax system. That is a process upon which the government has. embarked and about which I want to make a few comments later on in my contribution. I am particularly interested in the issue of fringe benefits tax. This legislation deals with some changes to the fringe benefits tax regime. I do not suppose there was ever a more controversial tax introduced in Australia. I recall the debate that went on at the time it was introduced. The tax was resented by the business community, and by the small business community in particular because they ended up having to collect the tax. Although in theory at least fringe benefits of the sort covered by the regime were taxable, the fact was that the tax was easily avoided. In the end the decision was taken by the former government in bringing in this tax that its incidence should be upon employers rather than employees. I do not necessarily agree to this day that that was the correct way to go. However, now the tax collects many millions-perhaps even billions-of dollars and, therefore, I do not think any government is going to want to change that to any great extent. There are, nevertheless, in this legislation some significant changes. This legislation picks up some of the recommendations of the report of the small business deregulation task force, brought down in November 1996. That task force was chaired by Mr Charlie Bell, who is the managing director of MCDonald's Australia. He had on his committee a number of prominent business people and accountants. The report was welcomed. It certainly was a very worthwhile report from the government's point of view. It brought down a number of recommendations. I would like to refer briefly to the beginning of the key finding of that report: The small business community is frustrated and overwhelmed by the complexity, and cost of dealing with government regulation and paperwork. Small businesses often do not understand their compliance obligations and have an underlying fear of penalties from doing the wrong thing. The Commonwealth Government, its departments and agencies must implement a broad and sustained program of action to reduce the burden and give small business operators more time to operate and grow their enterprises. There needs to be a substantial change in the culture of government. Governments must remove unnecessary regulation and improve the quality of administration. Proposed regulation needs careful scrutiny to ensure the burden on small business is minimised. Departments and agencies responsible for regulation must monitor the impact of their paperwork and compliance requirements on small business and report annually on their progress in reducing the burden. So it was in that context that this report went on to make a number of recommendations about the taxation system. As I say, the legislation that we are dealing with today deals with some of those recommendations, which the government is delivering on in the legislative sense. Dealing with taxation, the report says: Difficulties with the taxation system were the most important issues small business raised with the Task Force. The system is too complex in tenns of the number of taxes, the uncertainty of the frequency of changes, the difficulty of interpretation, the burden of record keeping and the costs of compliance ... That is quite a list. It goes on to say: Small businesses want simplicity and certainty in taxation matters. They see minor inequities being more than compensated by savings in recordkeeping, accounting fees, time and anxiety. The report then deals with the fringe benefits tax. This is really the pertinent feature of this report in the context of this legislation. The report observes: For many in small business, the fringe benefits tax (FBT) represents the worse aspects of the taxation system. It is difficult to understand and compliance is costly. Those compliance costs are [a] dead weight loss for small business and the economy generally. To reduce the complexity, compliance costs and paperwork associated with FBT the Task Force recommends it should be amended to: * introduce a simplified valuation formula for motor vehicles; * exempt meals from FBT and introduce a simplified fonnula for assessing the deductibility of meal expenses under the Income Tax Assessment Act; * exempt car parking and taxi travel from FBT; * align the FBT year with the income tax year at 30 June, and * change the so called arranger provisions so that the onus of paying FBT lies with the supplier of the benefit. The government responded to the report on 24 March 1997. As I recall, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) spoke in the parliament at that time. His response was entitled More time for business, which seems like an appropriate response to the original report which was entitled Time for business-I take it that somebody spent some time thinking about an appropriate name for the Prime Minister's report-and it dealt with the question of FBT. It said: The Government agrees with simplifying the arrangements for employee taxi travel by extending the existing FBT exemption to cover a. taxi trip arriving at or leaving from the place of work at any time of the day with effect from 1 April 1997. It goes on to implement a number of the changes. In fact, if you refer to the explanatory memorandum for the legislation, you will see it makes the point that we are actually the law, implementing the recommendations of the Bell task force in extending and simplifying the existing exemption for taxi travel, exempting car parking benefits provided by - ertai.n small businesses unless the car parking IS provided in commercial. c.ar parks and simplifying the arranger provlSlons. I am pleased that the government has accepted those recommendations of the Bell report. I recall that a. - ouple of years. ago when I was in OpposItIOn we had qUIte a debate in this place, and it went on in the community, about the car parking provisions. They were obviously an attempt by the former government to take the FBT regime from the sublime to the ridiculous and they created immense difficulties for businesses trying to interpret what car parking was FBTable, if I can put it in those terms, and what was FBT exempt. So this legislation addresses those recommendations of the Bell report and simplifies the original provisions, and I know that these changes will be well and truly welcomed within the business community. However, I am disappointed with one aspect of the government's response. When the response came forward, I was watching to see whether the recommendation that the Bell task force made in respect of exempting meals from FBT and introducing a simplified formula for assessing the deductibility of meal expenses under the Income Tax Assessment Act would be addressed. Coming as I do from an electorate that is heavily based on tourism and hospitality, this was one recommendation that I obviously welcomed. It is one that I have raised a number of times with successive governments but, to this date, with no success. In fact, I have taken in the last week or so to writing to the government's Tax Consultative Task Force, which has now been established and which is chaired by my colleague Senator Brian Gibson,. and I ha-e asked for consideration to be gIven to thIS particular issue. I hope it will be. The government response More time for business makes this point: The Government has decided not to proceed with the Task Force recommendations on cars and meal entertainment given the proposals would result in some employers paying increased tax and the revenue cost and broader tax policy implications the meal proposals. However, both car and meal benefits provided by small business can fall under the FBT record keeping exemption if the necessary conditions are met. I am not sure exactly what that last part means, but I was disappointed that the government did not accept that recommendation. It seems to me that when the changes to the treatment of these meal and other entertainment expenses was brought in it was an attempt by the former government to solve a problem that they saw existed, and that was that some of these things were being abused. In fact, there was a need, I believe, to tighten up the way these claims were made. But what we saw in the end was what amounted to throwing out the baby with the bath water, and a lot of jobs were lost in the hospitality and tourism industries. I believe that the tax system is capable of taking account of the concerns that existed at the time but in other ways. Clearly substantiation of expenses is not unreasonable, and I would hope that in due course, having raised the matter with the tax consultative task force, further consideration will be given to that particular proposal. As I said at the outset, the problems that we have with our tax system in Australia are well known. The complexity of our system, for anyone who has worked with it, is indicati-e of that particular problem. So tax reform III Australia is apriority, and I am pleased that the government has identified it as a priority and has moved towards undertaking a comprehensive review of o.ur tax system. Th-t is something that the preVIOUS government faIled to do. It simply tinkered with the existing tax system and inevitably just made it more and more complex. Australia needs now and business needs now a complete and comprehensive reform of the tax system. Within the current tax system there are so many inbuilt disincentives. Fo- in-tance, someone was drawing to my attentIOn Just the other day the fact that there are some people on $20,000 a year in salary or wages who are slightly better off than the-e on .$30POO a year. There is not much Illcentlve III the current system to earn more, and I think we do hear that from constituents from time to time where they say that it is just not worth of doing that extra work, doing that overtime or taking that extra job that is available, because in the end they are simply worse off. That is demonstrated when you look at a person's circumstances and you find that, because of the interaction of the welfare system with the wages system, it very often is the case that it is just not worth it. In fact, it is not only a matter of not being worth it; people are worse off sometimes when they are earning more. Those sorts of things need to be fixed, and clearly they can only be fixed by a fairly comprehensive review of the tax system and by a close look also at the welfare system. This cannot be fixed by simply making adjustments at the edge; it needs wholesale reform. The principles for reform of the tax system, in my view, are that the system ought to be fair, efficient, certain and simple to administer. They are the four principles that need to be applied to the reform of the tax system. In many respects, the present system clearly fails to meet them. In the context of the legislation we are looking at today, the number of amendments coming forward indicates the complexity of the system. But I think we can demonstrate also that the system is often unfair, is inefficient, is absolutely uncertain at times and is far from simple to administer. The government has established some broad criteria for its reform of the tax system. These are important. In the advertisement that appeared in the national press calling for input to the tax consultative task force, people were reminded that when making submissions they should: bear in mind the government's view that: there should be no increase in the overall tax burden; Clearly that is important. any new taxation system should involve major reductions in personal income tax with special regard to the taxation treatment of families; I certainly subscribe strongly to that. consideration should be given to a broad-based indirect tax to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes; there should be appropriate compensation for those deserving of special consideration; and reform of Commonwealth/State financial arrangements must be addressed. These are not exclusive, but there are five criteria set out there by the government for those who want to make submissions. We have yet to see the full extent of what the Labor Party's response to this task force's work might be or what its response to the outcomes might be. They foreshadowed some of their positions in respect of some aspects of tax reform, but overall I would hope that the opposition would support broadly this attempt to fix up the Australian tax system so that it is in fact a fairer and better system. More importantly even than that, it should be a system which makes the Australian business environment able to be more competitive in a world where we desperately need to be competitive for the sake of creating jobs. The focus so far, both from the Labor Party and in the community-to some extent understandably-has been on the question of a goods and services tax, or perhaps what is better described as a consumption tax or a value added tax. I made the point that the government has clearly put that on the agenda because we have called for consideration to be given to a broad based indirect-tax to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes. The reason for doing that obviously is that the current wholesale sales tax system which we labour under is so hopelessly out of date. Despite attempts to make it work better, the fact is that it does not work very well. There are all sorts of inconsistencies in it. Ultimately, of course, it has the fundamental flaw of taxing our exports at a time when one would have thought that that was quite inappropriate to the needs of our nation. So there are lots of good reasons why we should look seriously at a broad based consumption tax. The other thing about the current wholesale sales tax is that it fails to recognise that spending patterns have changed dramatically in recent years. (Time expired)",114

178,Mr LEE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"The legislation we are dealing with tonight is the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) 1997 and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997. I will spend a fair bit of my time tonight responding to some remarks which were made by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) in the debate last week on the state of the health insurance system and the government's promises on health care. I would like to begin by picking up on some of the remarks which were made by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) earlier this evening. He finished his contribution by enthusiastically endorsing the government's tax reform agenda. The Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay), who is at the table, also foolishly endorses the government's tax reform proposals. I will spend a few minutes pointing out some of the difficulties the government is going to face with its tax reform agenda. The member for MCPherson began by claiming that the government's agenda on tax reform is all about delivering a fairer system, one that is more effective and certain. No-one can object to a tax system being fair, effective or certain. The difficulty the government is going to face is that it is seeking to setup a bogus consultative mechanism which will deliver the preferred outcome of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), a GST. The government will then go into the next election seeking to persuade the Australian people that they should allow a re-elected Howard government or a re-elected government led by PI or P2, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) or the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), to implement the government's GST agenda. One of the main reasons we argue that a goods and services tax is unfair is that high income earners earn enough money that they can put some money aside in savings and superannuation, they can put some money into investments and the balance is spent on their consumption. For low income earners, almost their entire income is spent on consumption expenditure such as food, clothing or gear that their kids might need for school such as school uniforms, books and educational materials. Low income earners have less money to put aside for saving for their retirement and less money to put aside for investments. It is the Labor Party's very firm view that introducing a GST which hits high income earners at the same rate as low income earners will place a relatively higher and unfair burden on low income earners. It is very clear that the burden placed on low income earners compared with high income earners is unfair to those low income earners.",117
179,Mr SOMLYAY,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,Like the Medicare levy.,118
180,Mr LEE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"The minister at the table interjects, 'Like the Medicare levy.' One of the items we are discussing in tonight's bill is the income level at which the Medicare levy cuts in. The fact that we exempt low income earners from the Medicare levy is probably a good example of this whole argument, that for people who earn less than the Medicare levy threshold we say they should not be subject to any Medicare levy because they need every cent that they can earn or every cent that they receive from social security support, just to look after their families. Yesterday the Minister for Finance and Administration, Mr Fahey, was on the front page of some of the Sunday newspapers arguing that the GST was certain, that it was the GST or nothing and that it was this government that was determined to implement the GST. Honourable members opposite have seen their support plummet as we have seen crisis after crisis this year; as we have seen the government stumble over policy flip-flops such as in the nursing home policy; and as we have seen its attitude to a whole series of measures earlier this year. There were attempts to divert public attention by bringing in the phoney work for the dole program to distract attention from former Senator Bob Woods. We have seen a whole series of policy disasters from the government this year. That is the reason the government's support has evaporated this year as an increasing number of Australians have reached the conclusion that the hopes that they had in the Prime Minister, the hopes they had that this government would make a difference, seem to have been dissipated very quickly. If the government thinks that its support base has been eroded by its unfair and retrospective nursing home changes, its multiple backflips and backdowns on nursing home policy, wait until the Liberal and National parties try to explain to the Australian people that, at the next election, in addition to being answerable for their policy flip-flops on nursing home policy and pharmaceutical benefits, they are going to convince the Australian people they should vote to impose a new goods and services tax. That is when the amount of support they have out there in the wider community really will drop through the floor. If we are going to spend some time in the next 12 months discussing taxation reform, then what the Labor Party wants the government to do is not to spend all of its time working out ways to impose higher tax burdens on ordinary wage and salary earners. We do not want the government to spend all its time working out ways to impose a GST, 11; broad based goods and services tax which, when it has been introduced in every other country in the world, has started out at a low level and then as each year goes by governments step by step have ratcheted up the level of the GST. We do not want the government to be spending a lot of time working out new ways that new taxes can be used year by year to raise the general level of the taxation burden on the Australian people. What we want the government to do is to spend a bit more of its time on closing off the tax loopholes that have already emerged-the tax loopholes that all of us in this parliament know exist today. The one that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the minister at the table are well aware of is the use of family trusts, which allow high income earners to avoid paying their fair share of income tax. Before the last election, the former Labor government and the former Treasurer, Ralph Willis, received written advice from the Australian Taxation Office indicating that there were very large sums of money which the Taxation Office believed could be obtained if the government was prepared to follow a course of action that was advised by the Commissioner of Taxation, Michael Carmody. What we have seen in the 18 months since then is that this government has not been prepared to follow the advice which was given to the former government. Under the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Treasurer, Peter Costello, we have had government decisions that have watered down the former government's crackdown, which was based on the Taxation Office's advice. The result of this is that every year this government looks after its mates who are using these family trusts is another year when ordinary wage and salary earners are forced to pay more in taxation because this government is not prepared ,to close those loopholes. Those things need to be part of the taxation debate if the government wants to go down the GST path. If the government is determined to go down the path of a GST, as the Labor Party spokesman on health I am still waiting for the Prime Minister to let me know whether the government's plans will include a GST on health expenditure. We know in the Fightback package, which John Hewson took to the 1993 election, that health was zero rated. It was not quite clear what impact that would have on health care costs for ordinary wage and salary earners because, under some of the various analyses that were made at the time, each of the people who provide medical services might have been required to pay a GST on their business inputs, whether they be doctors, the hospital or other people. There are many ways to skin a cat and there are many ways you can increase the cost of health care by introducing a GST. If the government is not prepared to give us a commitment right at the very start then what the Australian people need to know is whether or not their health care costs will increase if the government imposes a GST. Are we going to have the 15 per cent GST imposed on health insurance premiums? What is the point in the government running around, fooling people on the cost of health insurance and falsely claiming that its tax rebate on health insurance is an attraction and encouragement for people to join health insurance if, at the same time, this government is working away in the back room to come up with a new 15 per cent additional cost for private health insurance? If people are currently paying $1,000 or $2,000 in annual health insurance premiums, imagine if the cost of those premiums goes up by that 15 per cent. Imagine if for the single person paying $1,000 it increases to $1,150 or if the $2,000 health insurance package for a family goes up to $2,300. The Australian people have a right to know at the start of this debate whether or not that 15 per cent GST will apply to health insurance premiums. Will it apply to the cost of visiting a general practitioner or a specialist? If it does apply to visits to the GP, will the government increase the Medicare rebate that currently covers the cost of a visit to a doctor who bulk bills? Or will the patient be hit with that 15 per cent tax as a new copayment? If someone gets treated in a hospital, will the 15 per cent be applied to the cost of all of the bills that are imposed by the private or public hospitals, by the specialists, by the anaesthetists and so on? Treatment in a hospital already adds up to quite a substantial cost and if a GST has to be paid by patients then that is going to mean the cost of hospital treatment will increase quite dramatically. The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 seeks to increase the income level at which the Medicare levy cuts in. The new upper limits of the ranges for individuals and families will be $14,474 and $24,425 respectively. In a speech made last Thursday in this debate, the honourable member for Moreton made a number of remarks about bulk billing. In particular, referring to the government's position, he said: We are committed to bulk-billing. We know that low income people in particular need this ... They need to know that they do not have to rustle around looking for money to pay the doctor's bill if their child needs access to a doctor. We understand that bulk-billing has an important place and this govern to ment is committed to it. They are views which the opposition is quite sympathetic to. What I found intriguing about the member for Moreton's contribution was that these comments were quite in contrast to earlier remarks he made about his claims that certain people were abusing the system of bulk-billing and that you needed to abolish bulk-billing so that people did not abuse the Medicare system. He went on to make some remarks about a report which was brought down in this House last week-a report that I am sure is close to your heart, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - about some changes that were recommended by one of the committees of this parliament that would allow doctors, using the 'mediclaim' system, to obtain immediate reimbursement for the Medicare component of doctors' bills. You will be pleased to know that the honourable member for Moreton has not walked away from the recommendations which the committee made at the time. Let me explain the impacts that those changes will have. Despite the fact that the honourable member for Moreton endorsed them in his contribution to this debate last Thursday, the changes would make it very difficult for those very same low income earners the honourable member for Moreton was mentioning to continue to receive medical services without having to make a copayment. About 80 per cent of GP visits are bulkbilled, which means that when people visit their GP the cost is met by the doctor, who lodges a claim, usually at the end of each month, on the government. The change the honourable member for Moreton is advocating is that doctors should be able to charge a copayment on top of the fee which the doctor gets from the government-the GP rebate, which is paid by Medicare. The honourable member for Moreton believes that that should be able to be obtained by the doctor through the mediclaim system: that is, by electronic transfer which provides the money more speedily to the doctor. At the moment there is pressure on doctors bulk-bill because they cannot charge a copayment as well as obtain the Medicare rebate. Doctors have to make that choice. They can either bulk-bill and receive the amounts directly from the government, or they can charge the patient and the patient lodges a claim for reimbursement from Medicare. The difference in the billing systems obviously puts pressure on doctors to, wherever possible, bulk-bill. It prohibits any doctor from bulk-billing and then imposing a co-payment on top of the fee which the doctor receives from Medicare. The honourable member for Moreton argues that doctors should be able to receive the bulk-billing payment and, in addition, levy a co-payment on the patient. That is a recipe for encouraging large numbers of doctors who are currently bulk-billing 80 per cent of the population to continue bulk-billing but impose these new co-payments on patients. The honourable member for Moreton says that he and the government are committed to bulkbilling and that he understands that people on low incomes 'need to know that they do not have to rustle around looking for money to pay the doctor's bill if their child needs access to a doctor'. I think that explains eloquently that low income families, when they need to see their GP, should not have to either find the cost of co-payments or be forced to provide the full cost of a visit to a doctor before they receive their Medicare rebate. We should remember that the AMA's recommended fee for a visit to a GP is $34 or more. If the Medicare rebate is much less than that, it means that the patient is required to pay a substantial amount of money upfront. The honourable member for Moreton went on to say: Itthe governmenthas taken a carrot and stick approach. It has incentives for people to get into private health insurance and penalties for higher income earners who are not in it. That carrot and stick approach of the higher Medicare levy, which is imposed on people whose incomes are over certain thresholds, together with the tax rebate of up to $450 for people who take out private health insurance, have not been too successful. The Labor Party argues that if you look at the massive cost of the health insurance rebate-at one point, it was $7 billion-there is very little to show for the government's policy. The government cut back federal funding for public hospitals by $800 million and for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by $500 million and completely abolished the Commonwealth dental health program, at $400 million, just to raise the $1.7 billion which it had blown on the private health insurance tax rebate. Despite the fact that the government announced in the August 1996 budget that this rebate was coming in, we still had people leaving private health insuranceup to l,OOO people a day in some quarters. The government claims that, with 35,000 people having joined in the most recent quarter, its policy is now a success. What it does not understand is that it spent about $50,000 of taxpayers' money for every person who has returned to private health insurance. That is the strongest possible evidence that this policy has been a complete and utter failure. This policy, which has been funded by cutbacks in funding for public hospitals, has not reduced the cost of private health insurance. We all know that premium increases have swallowed up most of the benefit of that tax rebate; in fact, there has been a reduction in members since this policy was announced, and the pressure has certainly not been taken off public hospitals. This government's cutbacks in federal funding for public hospitals have made the crisis worse. (Time expired)",118
181,Mr MILES,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamehtary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (8.20 p.m.)-in reply-I rise to conclude this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill offered (No.6) 1997 and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997. The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) referred to the funding cutbacks which had occurred. If there had not been a $10.5 billion debt when we came into government these cutbacks would not have had to happen. The government does not like to do this, but the fact is that you cannot live on bankcard all your life, which is what the Labor Party believes. These measures had to be taken. We hope the budget will be back in surplus by the next budget. I think that would be regarded by all Australians as a fantastic achievement. In regard to Medicare and the Medicare rebate, the Labor Party set about to destroy the private health insurance system. They would have been happy to see every bed in a private hospital empty. That is their approach. They wanted to get rid of people, and they were pretty successful. The number of people in private health insurance went from 62 per cent down to 32 per cent under the Labor Party, and that lengthened the queues in public hospitals, leaving 10,000 beds empty in private hospitals. That was a deliberate policy strategy by the Labor Party. The rebate system might only be small evidence that it is helping, but at least it did stop the rot. It stopped the numbers of people in private health insurance going down as it had been rapidly doing and decimating all private hospitals. I think those points ought to be made. Also, as I said right at the beginning in regard to the member's speech, this government would not have had to tackle cutbacks in public sector areas in this country except for the squandering of money that went on in an excessive manner by the previous Labor government. In summarising this debate, I will go over some of the merits of the changes made by the bill to the taxation laws, and make just a few comments about the Medicare amendment bill. Firstly, on capital losses, new section 160ZPA gives effect to the announcement made by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 29 April 1997 that the government would introduce legislation to prevent company groups from mUltiplying capital gains tax losses. The bill also contains amendments to the antiavoidance provisions contained in part 4A of the act to enable those provisions to apply to schemes which artificially create capital losses in the year in which the losses are created. The changes to company loss rules will make it possible for companies held by discretionary trusts to deduct their prior and current year losses and amounts relating to debts. These changes will allay taxpayer concerns about whether companies held by discretionary trusts can deduct losses and debts. Also, the changes will create consistenThis cy between the proposed trust loss provisions and the company loss provisions. The amendments to fringe benefits tax legislation in this bill implement several of the measures foreshadowed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his statement 'More time for business' in response to recommendations made by the small business deregulation task force. The amendments to the range of car parking and tax provisions will significantly reduce compliance costs for employers, and in particular for small businesses, in several areas and demonstrate the government's commitment to reducing FBT compliance costs for employers. The bill corrects a deficiency in the sales tax law to ensure that goods imported into Australia under a temporary importation exemption used in Australia, exported and then reimported will be subject to sales tax at the time of the second importation. Amendments to the company tax instalments system will assist small companies by allowing instalment taxpayers classified as small to pay their final tax liability for an income year later than currently required. The amendments here are to ensure that no franking credit or debit arises from the payment or refund of tax where those amounts are attributable to the retirement savings account business of a life assurance company and will implement the government's 1996 announcements concerning RSAs. This will bring the dividend imputation treatment of RSAs for life assurance companies into line with the treatment for banks and other financial institutions. This bill ensures that taxpayers will no longer be able to include amounts of expenditure as part of the costs base of an asset to the extent that the expenditure is deductible. The amendments will prevent double deductions that could currently arise in calculating the capital gain on the disposal of an asset, rectifying an anomaly with the current law. The bill also gives effect to the budget announcement that existing deficiencies in the formula for calculating the passive income of insurance companies under the controlled foreign company measures would be removed. amendment will give effect to the original policy intention of those amendments by excluding from passive income only the income derived on assets of the foreign subsidiary that are referrable to insurance policies held by residents who are not related to the controlled foreign company. The amendments on average calculated liabilities of life assurance companies, which require life assurance companies to use average calculated liabilities as a basis for working out taxable income, will provide a more accurate reflection of the liabilities a life assurance company has for policies held during the year to be used in the assessment of income tax and will prevent distortions caused by the use of calculated liabilities at the end of the income year. New section 61A will ensure that taxpayers who became taxable prior to 3 July 1995 bring their depreciable assets into the taxation system at their notional written down value. I will be moving an amendment in the consideration in detail stage to protect taxpayers who receive private binding rulings inconsistent with new section 61A. In regard to summing up on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No.2), I would just make the following comments. The Medicare levy low income exemption is for the thresholds to be changed. The bill implements a 1997-98 budget measure to increase the low income exemption thresholds that ensure that low income individuals and families are exempt from the Medicare levy. The thresholds for the 1997-98 financial year will be increased to $13,389 from $13,127 for individuals, and $22,594 from $22,152 for families. The family exemption threshold continues to be increased by $2,100 for each dependent child. These increased exemption thresholds result in changes to the income ranges over which the exemptions are shaded out. The new upper limits of the ranges for individuals and families will be $14,474 and $24,425 respectively. The individual exemption threshold is also used to provide an exemption from the Medicare levy surcharge for a low income person who would otherwise be liable for the surcharge because of the level of income of the person's spouse. The exemption level there is also to be increased to $13,389. I thank those members who have participated in the debate and commend the two bills to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",121
182,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I move: Schedule 3, item 2, page 51 (line 29) to page 52 (line 3), omit the item. What this issue revolves around is the attempt in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1997 to exempt all taxi travel from the application of the fringe benefits tax. In 1995 Labor reviewed the operation of the fringe benefits tax with a view to simplifying the compliance burden and exempting benefits where this was considered justified. We made some changes. In particular, we provided an exemption for outside hours taxi travel-that is, between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m - principally on security grounds for people who were required to travel to and from work during those times. This proposal to exempt all taxi travel from the application of fringe benefits tax will mean that directors and executives will be able to negotiate tax free travel by taxi to and from work if they so desire. That ought to be contrasted with the situation facing ordinary workers: they have to pay for their own travel to and from work on the bus, the train, the tram, et cetera, from their after tax income. Labor opposes this proposal on equity grounds. The exemptions that we introduced in 1995 recognised the special circumstances of late night or early morning travel. We believe those exemptions should remain but that no further exemption should be granted. To move in this way shows a typical disregard on the part of this government for ordinary PAYE taxpayers who will not be able to take advantage of a benefit of this kind. If I and other members of the opposition believed that onJjnary workers would be able to take advantage of taxi travel to and from work, and that their employers would be happy to provide that for them, we would be prepared to consider such an amendment. However, the fact is that only those who are already well off will be able to take advantage of this provision. So we do not believe it has an equity case for it. This is yet another example of the government's poor priorities. The Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), in summing up the second reading debate, talked about the $10 billion black hole. That is the kind of excuse we get for this government's appalling treatment of older Australians, for example. Amongst other things, we have had the introduction of new up-front entry fees for nursing homes, the debacle with the nursing home accommodation bonds and plan three, four or five which we heard today of residents having to find an extra $4,400 or so per annum. We have had the government imposing new income tested daily fees for nursing homes on top of the existing daily fees. We have seen increased prescription charges, with four million concession card holders now paying 50c more for each prescription. Prescriptions have gone up from $2.70 to $3.20. We have seen spending cuts to Australian Hearing Services. Some 30,000 Commonwealth senior card holders are no longer eligible for free hearing aids. The Commonwealth dental health program has been abolished and four million concession card holders now no longer have access to free dental health. We have seen spending on home and community care services slashed. All of that shabby treatment of older Australians was justified by reference to this huge black hole: 'We, the government, hate to do this to you but we have no choice.' This is yet another example of a hole being introduced into the tax base. I point this out to the House against the background of what has been described as the family tax initiative, costing a billion dollars per year. We have seen health insurance rebates costing around $600 million per year. We have seen capital gains tax provisions for business worth almost $400 million per year. We have seen a further $50 million per year in fringe benefits tax concessions. Those concessions amount to around $2 billion a year. If you add to that the ludicrous savings rebate proposal, that costs a further $2 billion per year within a few years. All of that punches a hole of around $4 billion per year in the income tax base of the country. On top of that you have the capital gains tax concessions and the fringe benefits tax concessions. (Extension a/time granted). On the one hand, the government is saying, 'We have no money. Therefore, we have to do all these shabby things to older people, such as introducing nursing home accommodation bonds and cutting into dental health and hearing programs.' On the other hand, the government can find the money to give away approximately $4 billion per year in revenue. In this case, we do not know what the cost of the fringe benefits tax exemption for free taxi travel will be. It is not set out in the explanatory memorandum. My recollection is that the car parking exemption will cost about $35 million, but no estimate is provided for the exemption for taxi travel. Nonetheless, it is of the same character: it reflects poor priorities on the part of the government. Therefore, the opposition will not support it. As a result, we have moved an amendment which will delete that particular proposal. I urge honourable members to support our amendment.",123
183,Mr MILES,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (8.36 p.m.)-We are opposed to this amendment. It is quite remarkable that the opposition would be opposing this legislation because it does help ordinary workers in regard to taxi travel and so forth. The purpose of our proposed amendment is to reduce the cost of complying with the existing exemption for taxi travel. Under the existing law, for an employer to qualify for the exemption, the employer would need to determine the time at which the travel commences, the departure and the arrival point, and whether the travel was directly between home and work before the benefit would qualify for the exemption. I think most members understand the complexities of administration in these types of issues. It is pretty important to alleviate that burden when you consider that it will also be beneficial to people who will be travelling home before 7 o'clock in the evening. A lot of workers do travel home before that time, and they may need a taxi for whatever purpose. They will be the beneficiaries. I note the comment that it is the wealthy who will benefit from this. Quite frankly, people who are on better salaries are usually provided with a car by companies. So I do not believe that comes into the equation. This Gallus, C. A. is a measure which lifts the burden off a lot of small employers and other employers in the community and which reduces the paperwork that is involved with it. Not only that, it benefits the battlers and the workers within the community. So we are opposed to this amendment. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Kelvin Thomson's) be agreed to.

184,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (8.46 p.m.)-I move government amendment No. 10: (1) Schedule 10, page 85 (after line 31), at the end of the Schedule, add: 4 Saving Section 61A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 does not apply to a transition taxpayer referred to in that section to the extent (if any) that, under a private ruling made before 14 May 1997 under Part IVAA of the Taxation Administration Act 1953, the Commissioner of Taxation has ruled that the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 applies to the transition er in a different way from the way in which it would apply under that section. This amendment to schedule 10 inserts a saving clause to shield any transition taxpayer who may have previously received a private binding ruling which the Commissioner of Taxation has ruled in a different way from that provided by the new section 61A. The amendment provides that the new section 61A will not apply to a transition taxpayer to the extent that the commissioner has previously ruled in a different way in a private binding ruling. I commend that amendment to the House and I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum.",125
185,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PAIRS,"We find the amendment moved by the government a bit disturbing. We have been told that the primary aim of schedule to is to clarify the way the tax commissioner has always construed the depreciation provisions involving balancing charges with respect to previously tax exempt entities. This amendment is supposed to show that this is beyond doubt. Indeed, paragraphs to.7, to.8 and 10.9 at pages 114 and 115 of the explanatory memorandum confirm that the schedule is to affirm what the commissioner has previously ruled. For example, paragraph to.7 states, inter alia: The Commissioner has consistently administered section 61 ... Surely if the commissioner has consistently administered the depr-ciation provisions, whether by way of private binding ruling or any other actions, this amendment would be redundant. So it is not consistent for the government to argue that they are clarifying the law to ensure that it accords with what taxpayers have been advised and then to come in here and say that they wish to exclude the effect of the new law on taxpayers to whom they have previously given binding private rulings. I would appreciate an explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) of this anomaly. It suggests that the commissioner has issued binding private rulings that are inconsistent taxpaywith the provisions of this bill. This means that different taxpayers may well have been advised differently on the same questions of law and this amendment seeks to maintain this situation. Accordingly, I would appreciate an explanation of this matter.",126
186,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"Bradd on-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (8.49 p.m.)-Basically the commissioner is aware of an isolated instance of a private ruling in this matter. We just want to make sure that it is covered and if there are any others, those people are covered and it does not contravene the section.",126
187,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PAIRS,"The opposition is not proposing to oppose the amendment, but we do have some misgivings about it. It is a kind of 'trust me' amendment, asking us to approve something we know very little about, and it is not the way in which the parliament usually functions. Having said that, we will not be opposing the amendment. Amendment agreed to.",126
188,Mr ROCHER,PAIRS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to let you know before you close the debate on the consideration in detail stage that I will want to speak on a couple of the schedules at length. I hope you do not put the question too quickly and fail to note me on my feet when that time comes. I move: Page 85, after Schedule 10 (after line 31) add: Schedule ll-Deductions for contributions to independent candidates Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 1 Section 78 Insert: Deductions for contributions to independent candidates (9A) A contribution by a taxpayer to a person who has been, during the year of income in which the contribution was made, a candidate at an election for a House of . the Commonwealth Parliament, or a House of a State or Territory Parliament, is an allowable deduction for the year of income in which the contribution was made if: (a) the contribution was made for the purpose of assisting the person to meet costs he or she has incurred or will incur in connection with the election; and (b) the person was not supported or sponsored by a registered political party (within the meaning of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918) in connection with the election; (c) the contribution is: (i) money; or (ii) property that was purchased by the taxpayer during the 12 months before the contribution was made; and (d) the value of the contribution is $2 or more; and (e) the taxpayer is not a company; and (f) the contribution is not a testamentary contribution. 2 Subsection 78(10) Repeal the subsection, substitute: $100 annual limit for deductions for contributions to political parties or candidates (10) The total deductions allowable to a taxpayer under subsection (9) or (9A) in respect of a year of income must not exceed $100. This amendment arises out of a recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report into the conduct of the 1996 general election. Recommendation No. 62 states: that section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act be amended to provide that donations to an independent candidate at a Federal or State election are tax deductible, at the same level as donations to registered parties. It should be quite clear to everyone in this place that I may have. a beneficial interest in this, although that is arguable. As a potential unendorsed, and therefore Independent, candidate at a subsequent election, I believe it is a matter of equity that any donors to my campaign, provided they do not exceed the stipulated $100, should benefit from tax deductibility. It is one of those matters which is a bit of an anachronism. There are not many Independents in this parliament. The couple that were in the previous parliament probably never felt constrained to make a submission along these lines. Mr Mack, the former member for North Sydney, eschewed any raids on the public purse-and I suppose taxed donations can be put in that category. I, along with my colleagues the member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the member for Calare (Mr Andren), do not have party affiliations. As the law stands at present, donations to my campaign and to the campaigns of my colleagues--cannot be tax deductible. The same also applies to Independent members in state parliaments. I have within the boundaries of my electorate a very fine Independent member in Dr Elizabeth Constable MLA, the member for Churchlands. My mind also goes across the river to another Independent candidate, the Hon.Phillip Pendal MLA, the member for South Perth. They, . along with all other Independent members, must surely, as a matter of ordinary justice, be in the same position as their main opponents, who are usually drawn from the ranks of the major parties. I am proposing a matter of simple equity. The present situation is something of an anachronism. It is understandable that to date donations to the campaigns of Independents have not benefited from tax deductibility because it is not in the interests of the major parties, it is not something which preoccupies their collective minds. If it is not pressed by someone like me or one of my colleaguesthe member for Cal are or the member for Moore-the chance is that even though what is being preposed is fair and just it will never be dealt with in this place. My main objective is quite clear. But, at the same time, I want to stress that, whilst it might be doubtful that we can move an amendment to a money bill in the House of Representatives because of constitutional limitations on members of this House, those limitations do not apply in this case. The fact is that what I am proposing confers a benefit on taxpayers. (Extension of time granted) What we are striving for is simple justice. It is a matter which any government will come to grips with sooner or later. It might as well be sooner. The government might as well get it out of the way. If it does not do it on this occasion, it will simply, as a matter of common decency, have to legislate in its own time. The point I was going to make before is that it is not an imposition which is not shared across the political spectrum. It is not, I suspect, going to involve any great burden on the revenue. I am proposing, therefore, in my new schedule 11 amendment, changes to section 78 of the act. The provisions of my amendment are far more stringent than those which are now in the act and applicable to the political parties themselves or candidates of political parties. They are limited in their application in a way that donations to parties and their candidates are not so limited. I have proposed to make sure that donations are limited to a within a certain period so that it cannot be construed or even suggested that some personal advantage would accrue to an individual Independent candidate. In the new proposed subsection (9A) of section 78(a), it is proposed that the tax deductibility will apply if: (a) the contribution was made for the purpose of assisting the person to meet the costs or she has incurred or will tion with an election; and (b) the person was not supported or sponsored by a registered political party (within the meaning of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918) in connection with the election; It then goes on to set out the forms of donations which will apply for tax deductibility. In relation to donations to political parties, in the new subsection 78(10) I am proposing that: (10) The total deductions allowable to a taxpayer under subsection (9) or (9A) in income must not exceed $100. In every sense of the term, I propose a fair approach. Whilst it is more stringent on Independent candidates and their supporters, it is nevertheless appropriately worded. I repeat: I urge the government to support it. 'there is no doubt a case exists for acceptance purely on the grounds of equity. It has been recommended by the relevant joint standing committee, and it is just a matter of decency to other candidates. If the government is so persuaded it will accept it because by doing so it will avoid the need to move a similar amendment on a future occasion.",126
189,Mr ANDREN,PAIRS,"I rise to support this amendment moved by the distinguished member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). Let us hope that another Independent down the track represents a seat that bears his name and that it is named in his lifetime, because he has certainly earned that reward. I notice from the passion of his speaking on this amendment that he sent a very strong signal to whatever party out there may be toying with trying to induce him to hop back on board the party system. He has shown in his period as an Independent that he does truly speak with the voice of an Independent in this House. Clover Moore, a member of the New South Wales parliament, the member for Curtin, the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Graeme Campbell) and the member for Moore (Mr Filing), a great collection of Independents, have all noted that donations to Independent members of parliament are not tax deductible. In fact, recommendation 62 of the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Mattersthere cannot be any claims of self-interest he from either side of the House when they read incur in connecthis-recommended: That section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act be amended to provide that donations to an Independent candidate at a Federal or State election are tax deductible at the same level as donations to registered parties. In fact, this amendment does point out in subparagraph (a): the contribution was made for the purpose of assisting the person to meet costs he or she has incurred or will incur in connection with the respect of a year of election ... Under this amendment nothing can be claimed beyond the period of an election. Public funding of election campaigns is allegedly designed to lessen the extent to which political parties are reliant on financial support from trade unions, corporations and wealthy individuals. What a neat arrangement that is: having the value of both private and public funding and locking Independents out of the arrangement by virtue of the taxation laws and the inability of Independents to attract corporate dollars-not that any of us would be particularly interested in attracting corporate dollars but it excludes many people in the community who are unable financially to access the parliamentary process unless they happen to enjoy a particularly high profile in their community. An enormous number of people with an enormous amount to contribute to this parliamentary system are locked out by the very instruments that sustain and nurture the party system. The system is stacked in favour of the party club and against individual Independents. Almost $250,000 was spent in electronic advertising alone against me in the seat of Cal are in the last campaign. I spent about $50,000, half of that in print, with $8,000 being spent in the last couple of days to counter a quite misleading Liberal Party commercial that tried to smear me with some association with the former Prime Minister and his party, philosophy and such.",128
190,Mr FILING,PAIRS,It is an absolute disgrace.,129
191,Mr ANDREN,PAIRS,"It is an absolute disgrace. The public realised the games that were being played and in fact I believe that delivered me quite a few more votes than helped the cause of any particular party campaign. Such is the astuteness of the electorate, which is so devalued by the party system and their massive advertising campaigns. I would rather see a limit of $50,000 placed on any candidate in an election campaign. That would then level the playing field to make this a true and democracy, otherwise we will have the best democracy money can buy, and that will not include Independents. The parties received back about 40 per cent of the vote, at $1.50 a vote, in the seat of Calare plus that tax allowance under section 78. Therein lies the unfairness of this system. On 20 October the member for Curtin asked the Treasurer (Mr Costello) whether he believed an inequity exists in regard to tax deductibility for Independents and whether the Treasurer believed the act needed amending. The Treasurer, to the usual guffaws from the party members of this House, treated the question, I believe, with jocularity. He said was 'an interesting point'. (Extension of time granted) The Treasurer said he believed the reason for the anomaly, as he judged public opinion represented by the two sides of this chamber-here we are, four out of the five Independents present, and I would suggest a few more next time around; there are not two sides to this chamber: we are part of the nongovernment side and I wish the Treasurer and others would realise that fact, because it will haunt them and hit them between the eyes even more so down the track-is that there seems to be more support for tax deductibility for political parties than Independents. Who says so? Was that in any mandate won in March 1996? Put it to a referendum. What arrogance that the Treasurer should 'check with my colleagues whether there is a widespread view ih favour of that before announcing any particular position'. I believe that the public requests and demands that this sort of deductibility be allowed in the interests of democratic fairness. The Treasurer does not have to ask his colleagues. They have already spoken, in fact. They spoke in recommendation 62 of this particular report. It is there, clear as I read it and even trimmed back slightly by the member for Curtin in his quite fair and reasonable amendment moved in a responsible way, which I would expect from the member for Curtin. Doesn't it mean anything that his colleagues have spoken in a joint parliamentary committee's recommendation? It seems as though the Treasurer will act only if the executive is good and ready to act. The parliament has spoken through the comfairer mittee, which makes these amendments irresistible. To oppose them is not only hypocritical but undemocratic.",129
192,Mr FILING,PAIRS,"Earlier on today I spoke about what I consider to be the tyranny of the executive. In fact, it is the tyranny of the big party system. Mr Rocher-Executive imperialism.",129
193,Mr FILING,PAIRS,"Executive imperialism. I mentioned an extract from the maiden speech of the Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), who said: 'In the struggle between the executive and the parliait ment, I am for the parliament.' Yet here we see a situation where it is up to an independent member to propose to this chamber an amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) 1997, to the taxation laws, something which is fundamental to what would be a normal operating democratic system, and that is equality for all candidates. Why is it that a person who is representing a registered political party enjoys a superiority to somebody who is representing themselves as an irldependent candidate? Mr Andren-It is the club.",129
194,Mr FILING,PAIRS,"It is the big party club. It is the cosy arrangement we have in this place and in the Senate where the two big parties, the two big forces in Australian politics, collude amongst themselves to arrange things in such a way as to suit themselves. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) is sitting there amusedly, talking to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), no doubt in that cosy little way that the big party. members have, talking about how 'we' can organise this and organise that. This perpetuates a system that militates against the democratic rights of the people. . Mr Andren-Aren't you glad you are out of it?",130
195,Mr FILING,PAIRS,"The member for Calare asks me whether I am glad to be out of the system. I am, because I am able to represent my constituents in a way that I was never able to before. As an independent member I am able to represent them in a way that puts their it1terests first rather than the interests of a political party or some other body. I must say to the chamber that I find that far more satisfying than I ever did as a member of a party. I am not reflecting on members of the parties because I know that some go out of their way to represent their constituents within the limitations of party representation. But I cannot understand, for the life of me, why one particular candidate is treated differently from another. Why is a mem-er of a party able to enjoy the opportunity of attracting donations that attract a tax deduction and another candidate is not? It is illogical, it is unfair, it is undemocratic and I believe it is un-Australian. Why should that be the case? Even though the parliamentary committee that is charged with the responsibility of looking into electoral matters has come out with a recommendation that there be equality, it is up to an independent member to move the amendments necessary to bring that into force. In my view, not only is that disgraceful, it is antidemocratic and it reflects the cosy, familiar relationship that exists between the two major political blocs in our system to perpetuate themselves to the detriment of the constituents whom they are supposed to represent. All I can say is that any member who opposes this amendment ought to be thoroughly ashamed of themselves because this represents, in essence, an opportunity to set the balance straight or to make the playing field level, as the government is often wont to describe its efforts to introduce some of its amendments or reforms to the way our economy works. In conclusion, many people in this country today view our political system with a great deal of jaundice. They want something that is different. They want to be able to see alternatives. Unfortunately, our system militates against those alternatives by preventing anyone other than the major political parties from being able to accept donations that involve a tax deduction on the part of the donor. This amendment by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) moves to redress that inequality. In my view it is one of the most important amendments in recent times to ensure that this chamber, this parliament, reflects a truly democratic and accountable system. (Time expired)",130
196,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (9.14 p.m)-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker",130
197,Mr FILING,PAIRS,"You supported this once upon a time, Chris.",130
198,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"I did, did I? Is that right?",130
199,Mr FILING,PAIRS,"Yes, you did. I can remember you in opposition.",130
200,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"Is that right? I would like to make a few comments about this matter. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has indicated that he will look into and check over this matter. That remains the situation. So we will not be supporting the amendment at this stage. It has been interesting listening to some of the terminology in this debate-about this situation being illogical, unfair and undemocratic and the notion that it would be great to have a parliament of independents. My mind reflected on the Italian situation, where there are lots of small parties and independents. They have had something like 50 governments in 45 years. I suppose we could go out there and argue for an election every nine months if we had a lot of independents. The public would enjoy that, I am sure. Mr Filing interjecting",130
201,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"No, I gave you your time. The Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay) and I were talking about this matter, just reflecting on the nature of Independents and what they get and what they do not get on this particular issue. Another point which is just as legitimate in this debate is that, for those of us who are in major parties, the public funding goes to the party. I think, in your regard, the public funding goes to you as a private individual, and I understand that it is also not taxable.",131
202,Mr FILING,PAIRS,Is that a ruling?,131
203,Mr MILES,PAIRS,Maybe I could ask the commissioner for a ruling. I do not know if the member for Calare (Mr Andren) has actually been out and told his electors that for every vote he got $1.50 and he was able to actually put it into an account somewhere and it was not taxable. Mr Andren-I paid my bills.,131
204,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"You paid your bills, but I thought your bills were already tax deductible. So your bills are tax deductible and then you get paid $1.50 a vote from public funding, and it is not taxable. I do not know on this; I just think that maybe, if we wanted to get into a good debate about this, there would be a sort of balanced position that we would end up with here. I just point out that there are a few other swings and roundabouts in this in which the Independents actually benefit. I am not sure if it is the case, but my understanding was that they might have even got an extra staffer. Is that right? I think that is Mr Rocher-What has that got to do with this? Mr Martin Ferguson-Same as the shadow ministry.",131
205,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"--Yes, that is right, the same as shadow ministers, but I think not all shadow ministers actually get extra staff either. Anyway, let us not get into that; I think we are straying a little bit too widely on this issue. In regard to this matter, the Treasurer has given an indication, in answer to the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), when he said, 'I undertake on his behalf to check with my colleagues whether there is a widespread view in favour of that before announcing any particular position,' and that remains our position.",131
206,Mr ROCHER,PAIRS,"I think it would have been better if the Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) had sat down after he said that they were not going to accept the amendment, because he really got into some strange territory. As for the note on which he finished, my colleague the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) has already made it quite clear that-and I will give the Treasurer (Mr Costello) the benefit of the doubt in that he was giving an answer to a genuine question without notice-the Treasurer came up with an answer after he admitted ironically that he did not know what the particular recommendation in the report of the committee said. For that to now be a reason for not agreeing to this amendment is bordering on childish. He has had time since I asked that question but, the committee having reported, why would he need to go and check with his colleagues, and why the delay? It is hardly justification for a delay for what is a very straightforward proposition. The parliamentary secretary mentioned public funding. It does grate with members of the opposition because, although the Electoral Act says that it shall be paid to individual candidates, the party interposes itself and says, 'Well, yes, but because we are large parties we will provide in the act that it perhaps should be dispersed by us.' They right. would collect their public funding at $1.50odd per primary vote and they would disperse it and those poor souls who live in safe electorates do not see a brass razoo-hardly justification for an attitude expressed towards this amendment which, incidentally, has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with public funding. As for the politics of envy about an additional staff member, goodness gracious me, as Sir Joh might have said. So we get an extra staff member. Isn't it something to be aboard! We do not have the party apparatus; we do not have the people running: aro,lInd at the secretariat to feed us wi'th' 'gobbledegook. I might say that when 1 was on the receiving end of that it was some comfort to receive this whole avalanche of stuff weekly, but I also have to say that I only ever used 0.01 per cent of it. But it was a comfort to' know that I had that information therein the drawer upon which I could call if ,the need arose. The red herrings drawn across the floor by the parliamentary secretary reatly do him and the government no credit, and certainly the argument put forward for not, accepting the amendment and for in effe,c;t waiting for the Treasurer to come back from overseas to check with him before they decide whether they will do anything is in fact hardly the stuff of good, decisive gov-rnrnent. It is certainly not the stuff of a goVerntpent which is prepared to do the right, thing when the argument overwhelmingly>suppor-s the case. Of course, the parliamentary secretary had the decency not to argue against the principled position that the amendment put forward proposes. So I regret the fact that the' parliamentary secretary took it upon himself to digress from the real issue and introduce,' as r' have said, red herrings into the argument- The question is about tax deductibility for donations of up to $100 to campaign funds of Independents under conditions which are far more stringent than those applied to donations of candidates put forward by political par-je-.,",131
207,Mr ANDREN,PAIRS,"I will not take much time, except t6 cortect what might be a perception out there that I might have put away whatever my public funding amount was. In fact, I paid full ta)t on that. It was added to my incomy for the 1995-96 year. I have got no real problem' with thllt. The problem I have had' is the inordinate increase in the amount of flmding that, is expended by the party system, to the exclusion of independent candidates because they cannot afford it. I was happy to pal' back half of my $34,000. The $17,000 did not meet my bills. I put a rollover account of about $11,000 to pay off my bills, plus a few thousand more, so it cost me about $15,000 to run. That was money that was going to pay off a bit of the mortgage. So, no, there is no advantage to me in that particular system. As for the extra staffer, that extra staffer enables me to research all those bills that I have spoken on. Anyone who wants to can check Hansard and work out the amount of work that all the Independents do, perhaps compared with the amount of work that we might not be able to do if we did not have that extra resource. It enables us to meet the needs of our electorate and to try partially to match the resources that the party system has, both financially and in terms of personnel. It enables us to treat all the legislation as adequately as possible, and in great detail, might I say. As the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) said, the amendment he has moved has far more stringent requirements on us as Independents than those required by the party system. I can only repeat what I said earlier, that this is not some sort of Independent game we are playing; it is truly in the interests of allowing people to step out of the general community, not go through the party system and represent their constituents as fairly as I believe I am attempting to do without the paraphernalia and the imposts of the party system.",132
208,Ms HANSON,PAIRS,"Of all people in this House, I suppose I would be the person in the best position to speak on this matter. I suppose I would be the only person in this House who has not received my electoral funding, which I believe is due to me. The fact is that I was endorsed by the Liberal Party in November and thrown out in February, 16 days before the election. I then became an Independent prior to the election, 16 days out from the election. I have never received any electoral funding to this day. The electoral funding, which is $1.57 per vote, is received by every member of this House and has been received by the Independent members other than me. This electoral funding was actually put in place, as I believe, so that parliamentarians could not be , bought off by big business in performing the duties they were put in this House for. Mr Miles-Or unions.",132
209,Ms HANSON,PAIRS,"Or unions; that is right. Therefore this funding goes to the party to help in funding of campaigns and for other forms of media exposure to get them voted into government. The cost of my campaign was considerable. Apart from all that, my funding came to the amount of $55,000. I have not asked for this money to go to me personally but to go back to my electorate. After taking out my expenses, which were about $12,000, I had stated a couple of days before the election that this money would go back to my electorate to support my electorate either with a police car, to support the hospiignore. tal system or even to help the terminally ill. But the Liberal Party continues to fight me on this issue. I do not believe that the government or the opposition have the right to be hypocritical on this matter. We must all be treated fairly and equally in this House. If it is good for the Liberal Party, the Democrats, the Greens or the Labor Party, it is good enough for the Independents to receive their electoral funding, especially on the grounds of this being right across the board for everyone. Also, any contributions given to the Independents should be tax deductible, just like anyone else's. We are accountable to our constituents and to the Australian people for the sort of job we do here in the House. I support the amendment moved by the member for Curtin on this issue. This electoral funding is a important matter and I truly believe that it needs to be looked at fairly by the government. This is a democratic society and everybody in this House should be treated fairly and equally. Amendment negatived.",133
210,Mr ROCHER,PAIRS,"As I indicated in my speech during the second reading debate, the government and the opposition agreed to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) 1997 and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 being debated cognately. Unfortunately, I only had time to discuss the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 in my speech on the seconq re-ding. The legislation in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) 1997, comprised as it i.s of 10 separate schedules, was simply n.ot able to be coped with in a second readiijg debate. I want to speak at moderate length on a couple of schedules in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) 1997, which -,have had some time to study. I tum firstly to - chedule 3. The government de&erveS qredit for agreeing to some minor aspects of'reform of the fringe benefits tax regime as outlined in schedule 3 of the bill. However, it is timely to reflect on the more significantslllall business deregulation task force, tht(SBDT, recommendations that the govemm.-Qt has ilt the same time chosen to It""w\ls noted in a recent adjournment speectI thlj.t the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia, the CCIWA, in its response to 'the government's More time for business stat-ent highlighted that: In establishing the 'deregulation taskforce, the CommonwealtlrQoyemment described its target as the reductipn of the paper and compliance burden on small business by 50 per cent. Full implementation of the 62 recommendations of the deregulation taskforce would not have seen this target reached, the government's demand for revenue neutrality denying sUGh a- --tconie from the onset. Noneth-h}ss, the - CIWA went on to note that the propasalspresented to the government by its task force were not insubstantial. In fact, the SBDT nominated five facets of FBT that warranted immediate action by the government in order to simplify the system and thereby reduce t-e compliance burden on the very small, business' 'sector. These included a simplified valuation formula for motor vehicles, based on the purchase price, and exempting all meals frqm fringe benefits taxes, along with a straightforward formula for assessing deductibility Of meal expenses for income tax purposes.' 1 s-em to remember the latter was one of, those nOl1-core promises that the coalition made during the election campaign. The SBDT also recommended that car parking and taxi travel be FBT exempt, that the FBT year should be aligned with the income tax year - nd that the arranger provisions should be altered so that the onus of paying fringe benefits tax lies with the supplier of the benefit. Had the government agreed to those reforms it would have sent a very clear message to the business community. It would have demonstrated a resolve to tackle the very considerable compliance difficulties . and costs of FBT that have been highlighted by successive government reports. Instead, the coalition produced a four-point plan which, despite what the spin doctors would have us believe, will have very limited practical application for small business. On 17 February 1997 the Australian Financial Review reported the then Minister for Small Business and Consumer Mfairs, the member for Forrest  The number one issue in the deregulation taskforce report was the complexity and the compliance time and the cost of FBT ... We are worried about the time taken and the complexity of complying with FBT. What the then minister should have gone on to add was that this government has proven itself to be concerned about remedying the difficulties faced by business in complying with FBT only in so far as it does not affect the budget bottom line. The decision to exempt employers who suI mit an FBT return of $5,000 or less from ke\ t>;ng fringe benefits tax records has been thoroughly discredited by tax professionals who argue that no proprietor should be encouraged to adopt such a cavalier attitude towards accurate recording. Just as the coalition has backed away from its promised 50 per cent reduction in the compliance burden on small business during the term of this parliament, so too it has ignored the SBDT's call for the alignment of FBT with the income tax year. (Extension of time granted) Just as the government has failed to meet its deadline for the pledged 20 per cent reduction in compliance with Australian Bureau of Statistics forms, it has failed to commit itself to the total exemption of car parking from FBT. The decision to exempt car parking provided by small businesses to employees on the business's own premises, while welcome, is likely to have only a limited application, according to the CCIW A. Further, in differentiating between car parking that is provided on and off site, small businesses operating in an inner city area will be penalised for no reason other than that there are very limited opportunities to provide parking on site in these locations. The SBDT proposal to exempt all parking from FBT is consistent with recommendation 4.3 of the 1995 Senate Economic References Committee looking into the tax treatment of small business. In suggesting that car parking be exempt from FBT that committee did not qualify that the parking had to be on the site of the business, but simply noted that 'the general issue of FBT on car parking seems to have created confusion and an onerous burden of compliance'. The former Labor government ignored this recommendation, and it stands condemned for its inaction on simplification of FBT generally. However, it is the current government which, during the 1996 election campaign, marketed itself as the saviour of small businesses, and its performance should be judged accordingly. To date, the coalition has continued to avoid dealing with the most significant recommendations of its own task force. Arguably, the FBT regime is most cumbersome and costly to comply with in relation to meal entertainment and it was in this area that the SBDT proposed the most widespread of changes, calling for the complete exemption of all meals from the impost. The SBDT concluded that most meals are offered within a legitimate business context and argued against the need for differentiation by business between the kind of meal offered and the conditions under which it is offered. The same point was emphasised in the 1995 report The tax treatment of small business, which noted that: The taxation base for the FBT had expanded too much and was taxing not only items of remuneration, but also legitimate business costs. However, the government rejected this recommendation outright because of the negati ve impact it would have had on the aggregate FBT tax take .. Apparently, it is prepared to absorb a loss of revenue of $35 million per annum for the 1997-98 year as a result of the exemption of parking from FBT, but it has baulked at doing the same on meal entertainment. Industry bodies, including the CCIWA, have been scathing in their criticism of the coalition's failure to introduce any sort of reform to meal entertainment expenses. It noted that small business understands that real reform will have both policy and revenue implications for the government but that there is reasonable expectation that: . .. a government supportive of business will address these issues head on, recognising, in particular, that the costs of compliance borne by business are often disproportionately greater the tax collected. This point was demonstrated clearly in evidence provided to a Senate estimates committee as far back as May 1993 when it was revealed that the Australian Taxation Office had found an average of $52,000 of errors in every fifth FBT return submitted and that this high error rate was attributed to the complexity of the FBT regime. That was some four years ago. In the meantime there have been countless additions and amendments to the act, making it even more voluminous and complex. It would be no surprise then to note that in the 1995-96 year the ATO imposed $2.8 million of penalties on businesses for filling out FBT returns incorrectly. Yet the government has sidelined those SBDT recommendations that would have seen the most substantive reduction in this complexity. (Extension of time granted) From its humble beginnings in 1986, the fringe benefits tax has turned into a nice little earner for the Commonwealth, with collections rising to $3 billion for the year ended June 1996. Three of the four concessions made by the government with regard to FBT in its More Time for Business statement will have a negligible impact on the revenue raising capacity of the impost. If the coalition were interested in paying more than lipservice to its promises to the small business sector, it should have incorporated each of the task force's recommendations on the reform of FBT in this very bill. In schedule 5, the bill seeks to extend the time available to instalment taxpayers classified as being small to paying their estimated tax liability on 15 December following the income year and the balance of their liability on the following 15 March. According to the explanatory memorandum, the whole point in extending the time in which a small enterprise has to meet its tax obligation is 'to assist them in managing their cash flow'. It is in this context that an article that appeared in the Australian Financial Review late last week, relating to what impact the new 15 per cent superannuation impost will have on the cash flow of small business', needs to be considered. According to the than director of taxation at the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Mr Ian Langford-Brown;' small businesses will have to complete their tax returns five months earlier than usual iQ order to comply with this new requirement: Whereas small businesses would have had until 15 March each year to lodge their. income tax returns, in future any small busi-' ness owner who is also the trustee of a superannuation fund will have to comply with the new regular notification date of 31 October. ' Any benefits to cash flow that a small' business might have enjoyed-and I acknowledge there will be some-courtesy of the extension to the time they have to pay their final tax liability is certain to be eroded by their obligations under the new superannuation tax. As Mr Langford-Brown rightly observed that: This is very disappointing behaviour for a federal government that's supposed to be committed to cutting red tape for small businesses and helping promote small business growth. It is just one more example of the government's preparedness to make a minor concession to the private sector while simultaneously adding to the overall compliance burden on small. businesses. On 2 March 1997, the former Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, the  paper reporters that his government would know it had improved conditions for small businesses when 'if at the end of the day we have made life easier for small business'. The Association for Compliance Professionals Australia, which was established in the months after the election and which aims to keep business abreast of its ever increasing tax obligations, suggests that. the small business sector is still waiting for that day to come. A recent survey by AC Neilson MCNair suggests that tax compliance is costing the small business sector up to $7 billion each year. That is $7 billion that cannot be used by small businesses and their proprietors either to fund the growth of their small businesses or to employ additional staff. The running of a small business has evolved into a highly complex undertaking, thanks in part to our Byzantine taxation system. In the estimation of Mr Greg Hayes, from the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, small businesses administer 10 different taxes, each of which has five different compliance requirements, over the course of a year. He said, in an interview with the Australian this year: That's 50 different tax functions, none of which adds to productivity. The decision by the coalition to provide additional time for instalment taxpaying small businesses to meet their tax obligations is entirely consistent with its election commitment to reduce the regulatory burden on the sector and is supported. However, it should be remembered that the recommendation by the Bell deregulation task force to align the FBT year with the income tax year has been ignored by the government. This was not the first time that such a recommendation was made. (Extension of time granted) One of the key recommendations of the 1995 Senate Economics References Committee into the tax treatment of small business was that the FBT year should be brought into alignment with the financial year. Successive small business surveys have shown that the fringe benefits tax payment schedule is among the most difficult to administer, yet the government chose to ignore this in its More time for business statement. This gives further weight to the CCIWA's claim: Thoserecommendations of the SBDTthat were most important, particularly those relating to tax compliance, were also the most confronting to the government. It appears that the government has stepped away from these issues in consequence. The coalition's decision to extend the time available for small business to meet their tax obligation was no doubt made in part because it will not adversely affect the overall tax take. Rather, the changes in this bill will merely see the deferral of a small amount of tax, and that within anyone financial year. Despite the fact that the changes to the timing of fringe benefits tax sought by the SBDT would have had the same consequence, the recommendation was ignored in full by the government. With the government now more than halfway through its first term, the time has come for it to expedite a thorough reform of the overall regulatory burden on small business, instead of token gestures like this one. I remind the government that the red tape burden faced by the small business sector will not be substantially improved by a simple reduction in regulations like that with which I am dealing now. What is needed is a total review of the practices and concerns of the government-that is assuming one is needed after all this time-or the coalition risks being seen as standing in the way of a more profitable and viable small business sector.

211,Mr JENKINS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 has been acknowledged by both sides of the chamber as being a very important piece of legislation, but it has been characterised by a form of debate by those opposite which does not underscore the importance that they as a government place on the legislation. The contributions of government members have been characterised by attacks on the opposition that, inter alia, talk about 17 inquiries, 13 years and not much being done. A number of opposition speakers have ac1997 knowledged that that was not good enough. I would join with my colleagues in saying that more could have been done. To give credit where credit is due, the process to do the right thing by small business was there. When the parliament was prorogued for the election, there was a piece of legislation before the parliament which would have gone forward. If we are going to have a fair debate about this, that type of partisan debate should be dismissed. The substance of the additional debate by those opposite is that the second reading amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) as the spokesperson for the opposition is in some way playing politics. The second reading amendment and the amendments that will be moved on behalf of the opposition in the consideration in detail stage do one thing: they try to put in place, in legislative form, the principle of the report of the House of Representatives Industry, Science and Techintent nology Committee entitled Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia. As a member of that committee, I have to say, with the greatest sincerity, that I have been disappointed by the way in which this report has been dealt with in the debate. There are substantial matters of difference between what· is in this legislation and what was recommended by the committee. Even the committee chair, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), did not go to those differences. I am quite happy to listen to the debate and to be told, especially by those who were members of the committee, why, in the short while since the committee's report was tabled, they have changed their minds about matters of great substance. The first of those matters is that the committee recommended that the notion of 'unfair conduct' be reflected in the amendments to the Trade Practices Act. These amendments contained within this bill, of course, refer to the equitable doctrine of unconscionable conduct. By way of interjection, I tried to get the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans)-for the short period in which the honourable member for Bendigo was away at the UN he was the acting chair of the committee-to discuss the matters contained in chapter 6, which goes to the legislative protection against unfair conduct. It might be pertinent to read the Shakespearian quote with which we head off that chapter-'The law hath not been dead though it hath slept.' With the doctrine of unconscionability, if one looks at the way it has been practised, it has been of no great benefit to small business. This chapter goes in some great detail to justify the conclusion that the committee came to: that is, the type of amendments required that should have been contained in this piece of legislation should have referred to unfair conduct. So far in the debate, in what I believe to be a fairly cursory investigation of the matters at hand, unfair conduct has been dismissed because in some way it is a new concept, there is no basis in past law to justify it; whereas the doctrine of unconscionability has a background in law and, therefore, is believed to be easier to put in place. I grant that, if one goes to the explanatory memorandum, there is a fuller discussion of the options that were available to the government and why the conclusion that was come to has been arrived at. But I challenge those opposite-especially those who were members of the committee and who signed off on the report-to enter into the debate and justify why they as individuals come before us and support an amendment that was not supported by the committee. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I have had periods as government backbenchers. We know how it works. The minister either sends the package around to justify the bill, or you trot around to the minister to get some idea. But what has characterised the government members' contributions to this debate is that they are all just toeing the party line. I expect better. I really want to see a fuller investigation and discussion of the matters at hand.",137
212,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,We can't stand over our blokes like you do.,138
213,Mr JENKINS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I am not too sure about that. I think you have had some experience of that in your past guise as a whip. But we will not go into that in this debate. In the committee's report, conclusions were arrived at about the legislative protection that was required. Paragraph 6.57 of the report states: The committee believes that it is necessary to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to provide a general statutory standard of fairness in commerce broader than the present equitable doctrine of unconscionability. I repeat the word 'broader'. So, distinctly, the decision that has been made by the government is to go for a narrower form of protection for small business than that recommended by the committee. Let us not beat around the bush: that is what is happening as a result of this. The amendments do pick up on what the committee recommended about giving guidance as part of the act as to what sort of behaviour might be considered as unconscionable. But it still does not go to that broader concept that the committee was proposing of unfair conduct. Why did the committee come to that conclusion? There were other proposals put to the committee that the act should be amended so that there would be sanctions against harsh, oppressive and unconscionable behaviour. In evidence, including evidence from the ACCC, it was decided that perhaps that did not give clarity. Again, I will read into the record a quote from the committee's report. It has to be done to remind people what the committee intended. Paragraph 6.70 states: The word 'unfair' has the strong advantage of being widely understood being part of the everyday moral vocabulary of all Australians. Indeed, fairness is the social value central to the maintenance of social cohesion and the legitimacy of the social system. It has the added advantage of directly addressing the problem as it is usually articulated. The term 'unfair' is also used within the us law. For example the Federal Trade Commission defines 'unfair' as: (1) whether the practice without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law or otherwise; whether, in other words, it is within the penumbra of some common law statutory or other established concept of 'unfairness'; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to cons!Jmers or competitors or other businessmen. We can go to other law, we can go to other jurisdictions, and we can get the guidance. The guidance would still be there if the opposition's amendments are accepted, because they give the same sort of guidance to the jurisdictions as to what we believe to be unfair conduct. It should be remembered that unconscionability has a special disability test. A number of things through the law have been decided to be the basis for that special disability. But there was one thing in the past that was not included in that special disability test-that is, the differences in bargaining power between the parties. That has never been considered to constitute a special disability. If anything, this report was about that imbalance. That was what this report was all about. That is what the government needs to address in this legislation. Other aspects of the bill that are cause for concern, that are discussed in the second reading amendment and that will be tackled by the amendments in the consideration in detail stage go to the definition-or the de facto definition-of small business, by limiting the provisions of the new 51AC to transactions of less than $1 million. That is contained in the new provision 51AC at clause 7. The honourable member for Cowan waxed lyrical about how businesses with transactions of over $1 million surely could not be considered to be small businesses. But there are circumstances where contractual arrangements entered into by small businesses can total $1 million. That is not outside the realms of possibility. For instance, if a small business entered into a five-year contract and the rental for each year was $200,001-meaning the total of the contract was $1,000,005-that would put it outside these provisions. I would contend that such a situation is not totally outside the realms of possibility. Another example is that of a business entering into an agreement over a lO-year period where the rental for each year is $100,001. That business would then be outside of these conditions. I think it is a tragedy to tie ourselves into this form of definition or to set businesses outside these provisions on that basis. The opposition is coming before the parliament with a suggestion to use the ABS definition of small business so that these provisions can still be targeted at the people whom we wish to help in total as a parliament. I hope the government will take these comments on board and . treat them seriously. There has been some criticism that members of the opposition have dwelt too much on retail tenancy matters. The provisions of the act which go to industry codes are to be applauded. I congratulate the government on making them part of this amending bill. I believe the committee quite adequately justified the need to have legislative underpinning Of industry codes as part of the Trade Practices Act. Clearly, one of the most embarrassing aspects of the committee's inquiry was that nobody could come before the committee with an ironclad guarantee that voluntary codes without legislative underpinning had been a great success. That leads to several options. They can either be mandatory with legislative underpinning or they can take the form of an industry code-voluntary or otherwise-that has underpinning. I want to tum to an important retail tenancy matter which is affecting people in my electorate. I am referring to the conduct of the Greensborough Plaza Shopping Centre. The Greensborough Plaza Shopping Centre has, over the last three or four years, undergone quite considerable redevelopment and expansion. Two years ago, in August 1995, the first Myer store in Victoria was opened in 17 years. The Coles-Myer group in their wisdom decided that this would not be a full Myer store; it would be something less. Perhaps they had good commercial reasons for coming to the decision that this would succeed. But, regrettably, it was not what the customers wanted. There were no whitegoods. It was not seen to be a legitimate Myer store. It struggled for two years. What happened? As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, in commercial circles rumours start. In shopping centres people talk: 'Myer is going to close down.' There was discussion about what would go into the space. A couple of Fridays ago store-holders at Greensborough Plaza picked up their copy of the Herald-Sun to find an article about the annual general meeting of Coles-Myer the day before. The last paragraph of that article refers to the Chief Executive Officer of ColesMyer, Dennis Eck, who is under questioning: He conceded rumours of the closure of Greensborough Myer were true. It would be replaced by a baby Target and a new home department store. Guess what arrived in my office by fax on the same Friday? A letter from Lend Lease, the managing company of Greensborough Plaza. That letter states inter alia: The Target store will replace the existing Myer store and comes as a result of extensive market research. This research highlighted the importance of value to the customer as well as the need to expand the centre's homewares offer. I hope their extensive market research was better than the market research that led them to believe that a Myer store would succeed. They do not have a really good track record for putting in place stores at Greensborough Plaza. On the same Friday, the other tenants at Greensborough Plaza were informed of the decision. I do not know whether I am too much into conspiracies when I suggest that it is coincidental that on the same Friday there was an article in the newspaper in respect of this. It is not good enough. It is another example of a problem with retail tenancy. The rest of the traders at Greensborough Plaza are at the mercy of the big players. When the big players make a mistake and the centre management have to do something else, and when the big players, like Coles Myer, change the type of store that they are going to have and put in another competitor in direct competition with some of the smaller players, the smaller players have to lump it because they have nothing else to do. There is no sharing of the risk. There is no concept of that. You might have a store which sells homeware in Greensborough Plaza, you might be struggling and you cannot get rent relief. When it comes to renegotiating your rental and you say you are going bad, you are told by management, 'That is too bad, that is your problem.' Now they are told that the Coles Myer group are going to put in another competitor or that Target-a discount store which is part of the Coles Myer group-is going to compete against them. Those risks are not shared. That is why the opposition treats retail tenancy matters as important. That is why, in the absence of an indication-I am not even asking for a guarantee but an indication-that the government will look at the recommendations of the committee that suggest that there needs to be legislative underpinning of a rental tenancy code of such a type, the opposition will propose that we have it in the legislative function. We acknowledge that the bulk of retail tenancy legislation remains in the jurisdictions of the states and territories. We acknowledge that the Commonwealth has to go to the ministerial council and do the hard yards. The Trade Practices Act gives a lead. It underscores what the position should be. Those amendments should be supported. (Time expired)",138
214,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Mitchell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business) (10.10 p.m.)Tonight we are debating one element of the government's package entitled 'New deal: fair deal'. It is the name given by the federal government to a whole range of changes to the relationship primarily between small business and large business. I note that all members of the House, no matter what side they are on, are aware of the tensions and pressures that exist from time to time between small and large businesses. The honourable member for Bendigo, Bruce Reid, chaired a committee of this House that investigated the issue. It is probably the 18th or 19th time that small business has been looked at by this parliament, and so far it is the report that has produced results. Unfortunately, and tragically, during the term of the Labor Party in office 17 reports were produced and not one of those reports-well intentioned as many of them were; some of them were not even well intentioned but just sought to give a political solution to put off the capacity to make a decision to support small business-produced a single result. On the first occasion that something is done for small business in this House, the Labor Party members complain that it is not enough or it does not go in the direction that they would prefer it to go. They had 13 years and 17 reports within their own caucus-not being challenged in the parliament, not being challenged by the press, not being challenged by the small businesses of Australia-to develop policies and ideas and to produce legislation and results in this parliament. They were on this government side of the House and they did nothing. One must give credit to the former Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, the  the terms of reference for the parliamentary committee which allowed it to go widely into the relationship between small and large businesses. The committee produced a report which covered tenancy; the relationship and protection for small and large businesses, particularly where small businesses were being preyed upon by large businesses; codes of conduct; franchising reform; access to justice for small businesses; enforcement of justice; access to finance, which is a matter of great concern for small businesses in Australia at any time, but partic-arly in this day and age and right across this region as well; and the process for information and education for small business. A wide range of decisions has been taken by this government based on the Reid committee report and has been acted upon promptly by this federal government. A new small business section of the Trade Practices Act prohibiting unconscionable conduct, similar to the strong protection only which consumers already have, is being debated by the parliament tonight. As I have already said, despite the 13 years of trial runs and practice and no events and no results, the Australian Labor Party has come in with amendments to change things. The sale purpose of the amendments proposed by the Australian Labor Party is to delay the progress of these vital amendments to the Trade Practices Act so small business will see no relief from the Australian parliament before the next election. That is the plan. That is the purpose. It is the same way they have handled unfair dismissal: to set it aside. In an area where every member of this House understands the significance of unfair dismissal and its impact on small business, so too does every member of this House understand the significance of this legislation for the small businesses of Australia. If the Australian Labor Party takes this legislation into the Senate, opposes it in the Senate and seeks to subvert the progress of this significant legislation, I think it would be the most disgusting piece of political hypocrisy that I have seen in all my days in this parliament. You had 13 years and did nothing, and now you complain the moment somebody else does something and you want to block them from doing it. I cannot believe it. What incredible hypocrisy from the Australian Labor Party! When one comes to look at the details of what they are proposing, one must be more aghast. What they are saying in the first place is that the government should change the main part of the amendment from 'unconscionable conduct' to 'unfair conduct'. Mr Jenkins interjecting",140
215,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"There are good legal arguments, my friend, why we should not pursue the committee's line. You know those good arguments. But just to make sure that the House understands what the Australian Labor Party is doing, let me read from the bill itself. Subclause 51AC(3) says: ... the Courtin considering unconscionabilitymay have regard to: (a) the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the supplier and the business consumer .. ' . So much for your argument about strength; it is just finished. You have not even read the jolly legislation. Mr Jenkins-That would equally be a justification libout unfair conduct; the same principle is involved.",141
216,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,Here it is in the legislation itself-the very matter you were complaining about was not dealt with by the Australian government.,142
217,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member for Scullin to will restrain himself, and, the parliamentary secretary will address his remarks through chair, not to the honourable member for Scullin.",142
218,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I would be delighted to. The honourable member, who was a former speaker, raised matters of United States He raised matters of offending against public policy, the moral status of decisions and substantial injury being caused to an offended person under trade practices law. If he cared to read the government's legislation, sublet clause 51AC(3) then goes into 10 different sections, specifying almost to a word matters specified, spelt out and agreed to the committee to which he refers. It is in legislation. It is part of the unconscionable process, and the court may have regard to every one of those things that the committee agreed to. I know that any member of the House who had bothered to prepare themselves for this debate and had taken the time and the care to peruse what the government's intentions were, would know that there are 10 items, starting with: (a) the relative strengths of the bargaining positions ... (b) whether, as a result of conduct engaged by the supplier, the business consumer required to comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the supplier; and (c) whether the business consumer was able to understand any documents ... Even the comprehensiveness of the documents IS spelt out here in this legislation. It goes on to say: (d) whether ;lny undue influence or pressure was exerted on, or any unfair tactics were used against, the business consumer or a person acting on behalf of the business consumer by the supplier . . . It goes into whether coercion is created by an agent of the person creating a problem-a centre manager, for instance, seeking to put heat on a tenant on behalf of the property owner. It'is all covered here in the process of what is unconscionable. For members of the Australian Labor Party claim that the detail of unconscionability is not adequate is a complete furphy. That is one the reason why I say that they are seeking to delay this legislation rather than let small business have what it deserves-relief from the oppression that has been on them, the oppression identified by the Reid committee law. and which the Australian Labor Party is unwilling to rectify. If this legislation is so bad and so inadequate, why don't they let it pass and let us wear the criticism? But no, they want to hold it up-they do not want to it pass-by debate, amendment and carry on in the Senate. That is what we will see. the We will not see this through the House by because that is their intention-not to let the small business have their way but to slow down, block and obstruct. I will go on with some of the matters covered by the legislation, which states: (t) the extent to which the supplier's conduct towards the business consumer was consistent with the supplier's conduct in similar transactions between the supplier and other like business consumers. This is an excellent provision, which reflects the Robertson Patman amendment to the United States legislation. My friend opposite might care to learn this because that amendin ment covers behaviour in similar circumwas stances dealing with another person in a similar business transaction. Here we have it. The government has put it into this legislation. The legislation goes on: (g) the requirements of any applicable industry code; and (h) the requirements of any other industry code, if the business consumer acted on the reasonable belief that the supplier would comply with that code. He did not have to actually comply with the code under this legislation; it was his intention, or the person had a reasonable belief that he would comply with that code. It goes on: (i) the extent to which the supplier unreasonably failed to disclose to the business sumer: (i) any intended conduct of the supplier that might affect the interests of the consumer; and (ii) any risks to the business consumer ... It goes on and on. There are 10 subclauses here, one other after, lifted from the Reid report and embellished by careful examination of trade practices law around the world and within Australia. There we have it. Why would you want to amend or change that? Unconscionability is clearly speJt out. Although the government chose not to adopt the Reid committee's concept of unfair conduct, it accepted that a legislative response to fair trading issues was necessary. In the past, the Trade Practices Act had been shown to be ineffective in addressing some of the small businesses' fair trading concerns. Self-regulation, for example, in the franchise sector had also been proven to be ineffective in cases where a large proportion of people in an industry refused to be bound by a franchise code of practice-and we are going to have that as a mandatory process. They did nothing for 13 years but they agree to nearly all of it and commend to the governmenN.hat what they are doing is spectacular and different. But they are just trying to delay, to frustrate and to hold back a significant proportion of this legislation. The government has decided to establish a new small business provision. I have read from section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act that builds on well understood consumer protections against unconscionable conduct to small businesses and provides further protection against some of the business conduct identified by the Reid committee. We introduced a new business provision rather than extend the coverage for consumer transactions to maintain a distinction between the rights of the consumer on the one hand and the rights of small business on the other. In addition, we have limited the provision to transactions under $1 million that may involve unlisted businesses. The government believes that the new approach will not result in an unacceptable level of commercial uncertainty or unduly undermine contractual conarrangements. It is based on established legal doctrine. That is the strength of it-it is established on a doctrine that is understood. There business is already a body of case law on the protections available to the consumer against unconscionable conduct. The approach will also provide small businesses with the protections they need against a range of unfair business practices. I emphasise to the House that the problems of concern to the government are not the product of ordinary competitive forces or commercial risk. The new small business provision is designed to induce behavioural change in dealings between large and small businesses and to ensure that commercial dealings are carried on on a more equitable basis. It balances the need for fair conduct in commercial relations with the need to mainta.in an open market and does this without compromising the basic principles of contractual relations and commercial risks which remain at the core of our free enterprise system and our free enterprise economy. Some industry representatives have stated that there is a degree of uncertainty over exactly how the new business provisions will operate. Clearly, from the wording of our draft bill and the bill before the House, the basic definition of unconscionable conduct will be the same. A bargain will be deemed to be against conscience when one party is at a special disadvantage and the other party unconscionably takes advantage of the opportunity thus placed in his hands. I have dealt with all of the conditions. It is simple. There is an established legal practice. We have lifted that out from the consumer and placed it into the small business area. We have added the Reid committee provisions and more-lO special conditions that may be considered by the court in deciding what is unconscionable. We have a second matter that the Australian Labor Party wants to raise and object to-that is, the fact that there is no intention on the part of the government to have a uniform tenancy law in Australia. I would like to quote the Shadow Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Martin) when he was making his speech in the second reading debate. It was an interesting speech. If you go to the detail you will find the problem that the Australian Labor Party has not only in the area of tenancy but also in unconscionable conduct. The shadow minister says-and I think he was referring to the member for Bendigo: As he knows, an opinion in a submission given by Mr Dennis Rose QC, on behalf of Blake Dawson Waldron, lawyers to one of the major lobbying and constituent groups in small business-the Motor Trades Association of Australia Ltd-to the committee and subsequently to the government categorically states that, constitutionally, it is possible to bring down a uniform retail tenancy law which can be underpinned by changes to the Trade Practices Act, which will give effect to this implementation of a uniform retail tenancy code. The opposition will seek to do that. I looked at the submissions to the Motor Trades Association of Australia and found Mr Dennis Rose's submission. Mr Rose proposes in part 4 of his letter to Mr Delaney: In the States the Commonwealth's powers are limited to laws with respect to the subjects listed in the Constitution. They are found mainly in section 51. Of course, the Commonwealth's powers are related to trading or financial corporations and where the lessee has a trading or financial corporation. It seems to me that here is a test: is the matter going to be dealt with by the Australian Labor Party for tenancy? Can they apply the powers of the Commonwealth only to corporations? Of course, Mr Dennis Rose says, yes, that the only thing they can apply to is corporations. Then he goes on to say, 'Well, you must have everybody incorporated if you're going to have uniform tenancy rules.' So how does he suggest the Australian Labor Party or the Motor Trades Association get people to incorporate? He suggests that they force them to incorporate by having a tax surcharge on those who do not incorporate. What a ridiculou(thing. In order to get your way in some perverse and stupid manner, you are going to pass laws in this parliament which are going to tax more heavily the businesses of dads and mums, the partnerships, the sole traders and the trusts if they do not form themselves into an incorporated body. That is Mr Rose's opinion. You are saying that Mr Rose's opinion is the one that should be followed by the Australian Labor Party. That is the one you want to see through in the Senate. I can say that that is a ridiculous proposition. If it is your intention to force the partnerships, the sole traders and the trusts of Australia to pay a higher tax or be forced to incorporate, then that is a ridiculous proposition. If you are putting that one to the Australian parliament but not saying so, then I would have to say that you deserve all the criticism that you are going to get for that process. I repeat: what you are seeking to do is to treat this legislation like the unfair dismissal legislation. All you want to do is obstruct, delay and prevent the government from moving legislation through this House and through the Senate that will be of benefit to both the small businesses of Australia and the people employed by the small businesses of Australia. That is the objective of the Australian Labor Party: it is obstruction and delay. You do not wish to see these changes to the Trade Practices Act, which will make things fairer for small business, which will give small business better opportunity and provide small business with an opportunity not thought of, not dreamed of and not acted on by the Labor Party for 13 years.

219,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Native Title",145
220,Ms ELLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"We have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who has sacked thousands of Canberra workers and led our community into a recession-a recession boasted about by his colleague in the Senate, something the Prime Minister has yet to publicly denounce, to my knowledge. He has failed to defend the ACT against Senator Campbell. He has failed to defend us against the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) and others in their attacks on this community. He refuses to live here. He is planning to hold his office staff Christmas party in Sydney . Yet all of a sudden tonight on the ABC he declares an interest in defending us from what he thinks could be native title claims on residential leases in the ACT. What hypocrisy and how totally mischievous! Let us look at what the Prime Minister actually said tonight. In answer to a question relating to freehold and backyards, he said: So it is not only freehold but it is also commercial leases, residential leases. I mean the sort of leases people have here in Canberra, for example, fall into the category of exclusive possession tenures but they are not freehold. Now the High Court in the Wik case said that they are all in the same category. The interview went on with the interviewer saying: And are you suggesting that if somebody took out a native title claim on a suburban backyard in Canberra it has a genuine chance of success in the High Court? The Prime Minister answered: Kerry, I don't think it has, I don't believe it has but why not go the extra step and make certain that it doesn't happen. Why make certain something that will not occur? This is scaremongering. It is sensationalism. And the cleverness-or, should I say, the sneakiness-of his words: 'there probably isn't a problem but let's legislate to be sure' and 'I don't think it has, I don't believe it has but why not just in case'. The Australian constitution-l believe it is in section 125--established, as we all know, the requirement for a national capital. Around 1912 that process eventually began and over proceeding years land was acquired by the Crown. Vast tracts of the now ACT which were New South Wales freehold were seized back by the Commonwealth over that time. The development of the ACT had commenced, and a range of leases were issued, including residential leases. In fact, the vast majority of leases in the ACT are residential leases, obviously. The ACT residential lease is an absolute right of the lessee to the enjoyment of the land to the exclusion of all others apart from its landlord-that is, the Territory. As such, these leases fall fairly into the definition used in Wik for the types of interests that would extinguish native title. There is, of course, vacant land, unleased land, which may be subject to native title claims if there is no lease over it. Some claims have, in fact, been lodged and negotiations are proceeding, and I do not recall any hysteria pervading this community as a result. However, I repeat: it is mischievous, in fact desperate, of the Prime Minister to attempt to throw into doubt the security of residential leases in the ACT. This behaviour is outrageous, it is unacceptable and I ask the basic question: why raise a problem when the problem does not exist in the first place? It seems to me that this Prime Minister and his government are desperate to continue to throw red herrings of any kind at anybody's cost across the trail of the Wik case. I deplore it, I condemn it and I thank the Prime Minister not one iota for interfering in something when we do not need him to do so. Native Title",145
221,Dr NELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Bradfield) (10.34 p.m.)Charleville in remote Queensland is a long way-culturally, economically and geographically-from the lives that are led by my constituents in the electorate of Bradfield on Sydney's upper North Shore. However, Charleville is the epicentre of the problems presented by the Native Title Act and the justice of a fair resolution-if such a goal is achievable. I have been to Charleville. I remember it was very hot and it was dry. I also recall that the poor health and existential despair of Aboriginal people was matched only by the drought stricken malaise gripping the entire community, especially those struggling to survive and make a living on the land. I have not yet met Peter Wales, the parish priest from Charleville's All Saints Anglican Church, but I hope to one day. During the recent emotion charged attack on the government's proposed amendments to the Native Title Act by a number of church leaders, Reverend Wales put the entire issue into perspective with a clarity I had not previously heard. What he had sought to courageously do was to give Australians an understanding of the needs and circumstances of both Aboriginal people and pastoralists. Having told him that I had reminded this House that 'however noble the cause, 220 years of European property law cannot easily be unravelled and our responsibility is as much to the future as it is to reconciliation of the past', Reverend Wales wrote me a letter, and he said that I may use the letter in any form that I felt appropriate. I would like to read just a couple of passages from the letter which he wrote to me: The first duty of love is to listen. One of the most important parts of my ministry as an Anglican priest is simply listening ... We cannot resolve the crimes of the past by creating new injustices now, so what can be done that will bring healing now without creating division and ill-will Australians who make their living on the land face tremendous insecurity and hardship. People in my parish have faced fires, two major floods, and possibly the worse drought in living memory, all within the last seven years. This marginalised and frequently impoverished group of people is now being asked to carry the burden of reconciliation in a way that most church leaders, politicians and city people would find intolerable. Asking a marginalised minority to accept a burden they will not carry themselves, is unjust and un-Australian. Whatever the solution to the present crisis may be-and our response to the needs of indigenous people should be both swift and generous-it will not involve asking families in the country to bear alone a cost that is owed by every Australian. The most important part of this debate about native title-personally I think there are only half-a-dozen people in the entire country who fully understand it-is that it seems to be as complex as it is unpredictable. But what seems to have been missing is a genuine attempt by those who represent the interests and needs of pastoralists, miners and petroleum explorers to fully understand the injustices, the dispossession and the maltreatment of indigenous people in past generations. But, equally, some of those who have sought to represent indigenous people have failed to meaningfully understand the circumstances faced by those who are struggling to survive on the land, who are responsible for the creation of a not inconsiderable amount of wealth in this country, which we as a government distribute to those with neither power nor influence, whether they be black or white. Listening to another person's point of view is a great risk. I suggest to the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) that he do just that. You run the risk of acquiring a deeper understanding. You might even change your mind. What you need to do, my friend, is to listen to those who work and live on the land and know what it is like to go out and shoot drought-stricken ewes every day and wonder whether your husband is going to shoot himself as much as you need to understand the impoverishment of Aboriginal people. Whatever else this nation achieves, if there is no improvement to the health and living standards of Aboriginal people, nothing will have been achieved and certainly not by your in the future? insincerity, my friend. Mobile Telephone Towers",145
222,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"Prospect) (10.39 p.m.)Tonight I would like to bring to light how the selfish actions of the telecommunications carrier Vodafone Australia have dramatically affected a small pocket of my electorate over the last few days. I know the subject of mobile phone towers violating our residential landscape is not a new one. I appreciate that there is an unfortunate need for mobile phone bases to be located in our suburbs if we are to enjoy the fruits of mobile telecommunication in this country. Nevertheless, I think the residents of my electorate have a legitimate grievance in this case. They have been let down by governments-and I mean all governments-and they have been seriously taken advantage of by big business. Late last year Vodafone Australia alerted Faidield City Council-which is the local government body covering the majority of my electorate-to its intentions to erect a new mobile phone tower in the suburb of Abbotsbury. Council was against the idea for two reasons, one being that residents already had to contend with four large towers in the immediate area, an arrangement which provided more than enough opportunity for carriers like Vodafone to 'co-locate' their services as opposed to building a completely new tower. The second reason was that the area pinpointed by Vodafone for its proposed tower is adjacent to where the equestrian and mountain bike events will be held during the Sydney Olympics. It was council's view that placing another tower near the sites would create an additional eyesore for tourists and spectators alike. It was for these reasons that council formally rejected Vodafone's proposal and suggested it make alternative arrangements. Vodafone, for its part, disagreed with council's decision and signalled its intentions to proceed with its development. Members may notice that at no time have I said Vodafone actually sought council's 'approval' for its actions; merely it 'signalled' its intentions. It did not do so because under Commonwealth law it is unnecessary for it to do so. I will return to this point in a moment. On Thursday last week, without prior notice and without informing nearby residents, a number of trucks, cranes and workmen arrived at a property owned by Sydney Water in Abbotsbury and began constructing a 35metre high mobile phone tower. By Saturday it was finished. Like a thief in the night, Vodafone Australia had ridden roughshod over the concerns and feelings of local residents and had completely disregarded the opposition to the tower by the local council. So why was Vodafone able--quite legally and legitimately-to act in the outrageous way it has? The answer can be found in the Telecommunications Act of 1991. Under the act companies like Vodafone are merely required to notify and consult with local government bodies prior to erecting their towers. They do not need to seek or to gain actual building approval from the council. Strangely enough, this state of affairs will continue only until December 31 this year, when a grandfather clause in the act comes into effect, requiring normal council building approval before developments such as these are begun. This explains Vodafone's mad rush to get this latest tower up and working before the deadline hit. While this may be true, the people of Abbotsbury will find little solace in this quirk of the legislation. I for one during that period of time never realised that it existed in the act. The residents of Abbotsbury expected that the sometimes infuriating but necessary levels of bureaucracy which usually surround building approvals on this scale-which would apply to them if they wanted to build anything in their backyards-also applied to Vodafone. They were wrong. The residents of Abbotsbury might not be able to build something in their backyards without council approval but Vodafone Australia certainly was able to. This is an inadequacy in the act which should never have been approved. It was a mistake of the former government to let it pass. It has allowed insensitive and profit hungry multinationals like Vodafone Australia, which is, incidentally, worth $2.8 billion at the present time, to come into our communities, scar our neighbourhoods and upset people's peace of mind with impunity. Vodafone's callous and inflexible attitude to this issue deserves strong condemnation. When a constituent of mine rang the company today to inquire about the tower she was all but told to bug off. Vodafone may have initially consulted with council over its plans, but rather than take its reservations on board, rather than work with the community and council to arrive at a solution which was acceptable to all parties, it threw the problem in the too hard basket and took the easy way out. Vodafone may have legally been in the right to take this course of action, but I believe it was morally wrong. Vodafone Australia has proven itself an unworthy corporate citizen and its actions do its reputation no service in my community. As for Sydney Water's role in this sorry episode, I was informed by a representative from Vodafone Australia today that it has over 100 of the company's towers situated on its property around Sydney. As a former New South Wales state government minister with responsibility for the Water Board, or Sydney Water, as it is now known, I find it difficult to imagine how a minister could give blanket approval for these sorts of goings-on without consideration of how that would affect local residents and their neighbourhoods. I am glad that, come 1 January next year, this situation will not be able to be repeated but, as I said, this will bring little comfort the people of Abbotsbury. Nor will it bring comfort to the unfortunate people elsewhere in metropolitan Australia who may find themselves, without warning, living under mobile phone towers by the end of this month as telecommunications carriers rush to build their towers under deadline and with complete and absolute freedom. (Time expired) Redcliffe and District Cardiac Rehabilitation Support Group",146
223,Ms GAMBARO,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to draw to the attention of the House the Redcliffe and District Cardiac Rehabilitation Support Group and their fight for survival. This group has a loyal band of supporters and works tirelessly to help local people who may be recovering from a heart attack or some other heart condition. The Cardiac Rehabilitation Support Group is the initiative of the Redcliffe-Caboolture-Bribie Division of General Practice and has been operating for the last 2V2 years. It may only be a group of 150 residents on the Redcliffe peninsula, it may have only a small budget, it may not be widely known throughout this place or even the Petrie electorate as a whole, but it does have something special-it has the commitment and strength of many. The group has the determination to ensure that the valuable assistance already provided will continue. In the Redcliffe and Bayside Herald of 19 November 1997, there was a story of a man called Norman Hoefler, who used the services of the cardiac rehabilitation group two years ago following a heart attack. The article reflected on the support, friendship, guidance and motivation provided by the group that was invaluable in his rehabilitation. When Norman first joined the group, he could walk only 10 metres but, with the help of the cardiac rehabilitation group, he is now able to walk a kilometre at a time. The cardiac rehabilitation project has a commitment to improve the lifestyles of others and has been recognised Mith many national and state awards for its efforts in helping people with cardiac conditions. Nearly 30 per cent of the Redcliffe peninto sula's population is aged 55 or over, a high percentage for any community in Australia. These types of support groups are not just a gymnasium but a network of people all sharing common health goals and objectives. Earlier this year I went to the opening of the group's gymnasium at Redcliffe hospital which now plays a vital part in the patients rehabilitation process. During the visit, I was able to see the important role that this group plays. The group's present situation follows the decision by the Division of General Practice to extend the project until only 31 December this year. The funding problems for this program have come at a time when the funding for the Division of General Practice for the next financial year has actually increased. There have been some reports and speculation that federal funding to the cardiac rehabilitation group has been cut. This is not entirely true as the funding to the Division of General Practice, which will provide the impetus for the program, will actually increase over the next financial year. It is indeed up to the division to decide how the money should be allocated within its areanot a simple process. What a pity that this group of people at Redcliffe has been caught up in this whole situation of politics. I have met with those involved in the cardiac rehabilitation program, I have spoken with representatives from the Division of General Practice about the funding situation and I have been in contact with the Queensland Minister for Health, the Han. Mike Horan, to look at some alternative funding options. I believe that there is a real need for the service and program which is currently provided. I will continue to work with the group and other parties and I hope to achieve a satisfactory outcome for all of those involved. Native Title",148
224,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"We are part of history being made tonight. As we watch the debate in the Senate this evening, it is of great significance to note the way that the native title amendment legislation is moving. I remember well-as, I am sure, do many other members of this House-the period in late 1993 when the original Mabo legislation was passed. I also remember very weIl the discussion and negotiation between many members of the then government and the various interests that were involved. I remember the difficulty that we faced in trying to choose and to judge where the balance should be-what was fair and what was not-and the responsibility that was placed on us as members of the government of Australia to make a decision and a judgment that was not only simply valid in law and just in terms of morality and our history but would also build a basis for the years ahead. I have sensed this evening and this week the same sense of occasion but not the same sense of concern. I have this feeling that many members of the current government are caught between a rock and a hard place. We are watching at the moment not an honest, open negotiation between the government and the community but a series of subterfuges which are deceptive, misleading and very dangerous as to where they will take this country. The idea that somehow anybody in this House should take lightly the position of any Australian is untenable. We all represent a tremendously diverse range of people in terms of employment, backgrounds, capacity, experiences and what we bring to this country. The idea that somehow there is them and us-that one side of the House takes one point of view and the other side automatically opposes it-I have never found to be either valid or appropriate, except that I do recall in 1993 the comments made by the then Leader of the Opposition after that legislation was carried that it was a day of shame. Those words still ring very strongly with me because that is how he and many of his colleagues saw the original native title legislation and last week, this week and tonight we have seen an echoing of a day of shame being unwound, reversed and untwisted. As part of that process, we had the deception last night about the 79 per cent-I do not know how many people actually saw the live 7.30 Report of not so long ago when that map was held up for the first time and felt the shock and horror that I felt that a Prime Minister was prepared to do that. I say that because I have on the Notice Paper this week a question to the Prime Minister asking him what the 79 per cent consists of, because noone I have asked can actually teIl me who they are and where they are. I had the privilege last week of talking to a woman from a pastoral lease. As I was talking to her about access and whether or not it was reasonable, she said, 'ActuaIly, we have great access. We haven't got a problem,' but her landlord was the Sultan of Brunei. Perhaps he understands what native title means. Like many others, I have been trying to find out for some months who are the 79 per cent who are potentially able to be vetoed by Aborigines. Are they Australians? How many people are involved? There appears to be something like 7,000 to 9,000 leases only, and one does not know how many people and how many are offshore. These are the issues. Rather than talking about maps, we reaIly should be talking about who we are representing here and what we are doing it for. Native title rarely provides exclusive occupancy. It is a shared title, as we understand. The community may not. Last night the impression was given that it was exclusive, that it was massive and that it was a smaIl percentage who were taking over the country, and that was pure deception. (Time expired) Member for Dickson Native Title",149
225,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"In my tenure as the member for Dickson, the newspapers and other media have seen fit to profit out of some very personal and private matters surrounding me. The state Labor member for Caboolture, Mr Sullivan, a person whom I do not know, have never met nor have had any political sword fight with, had been until last week the only person, to my knowledge, who has had a cheap and nasty shot at my personal life under parliamentary privilege. I have never pretended to anyone that I have led my life as a paragon of moral virtue. My behaviour has hurt people whom I love and whom I care for. My children have been hurt; they did not deserve to be. Anna has been hurt; she did not deserve to be. Others have been hurt. For that I am sorry. Judgments upon my life by people who know me I do not mind, although one's true friends are frequently the harshest critics and at times can cut fearfully. Anyone who knows me will understand how I feel about injustice. I loathe it. Injustice drove me to a career in law. I have helped without charge many people who needed justice. Such a case was earlier this year when I appeared for five Aboriginal boys in the Children's Court at Cherbourg. They were pleading guilty to a string of serious property offences. One of those boys had lived a terrible life. Instead of being, as we would expect, fed and clothed in a fairly normal family, as a normal child would be, he spent his life scavenging for food and shelter. There was evidence of malnutrition in the records held on him by the Department of Family Services. This absolutely devastated me. It was the first time. I had encountered such a background in the whole of my association with Cherbourg. That association goes back to 1983. It is true that I was paid for my work there on most occasions, but there were quite a few times that I appeared because Aboriginal people needed my help and Legal Aid was not prepared to fund legal representation. I entered parliament because of injustice, too. However, at times I feel I was achieving much more at the bar. At least there you can win about half the time. On the other hand, this place is pregnant with injustice. Child support is a massive area that I want to tackle. Aboriginal affairs is another. Anyone who has read my speeches about native title will realise that I believe native title is no way ahead to improve the lot of Aborigines in this country. It will retard progress. In my view, it has already. Since the Native Title Act was passed by the former Labor government, more than $210 million has been spent on native title claims and associated matters. Where has it gone? Mostly to lawyers, advisers and the many other people who are living comfortable lives on the native title payroll. That is why I say it is a sham, an illusion and a big con, where most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will not get a thing out of it. It has divided this country into white and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. I have kept saying it and I will say it again: I have never seen more division in this country since the notion of reconciliation and native title came to the fore. That is not good for Australia. Last week in the Senate the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Faulkner, said that my statements about native title were pig ignorance. Far from it, Senator Faulkner. It is part of the obscenity that he, Keating, Lavarch, Kernot and Pearson designed in the discredited Native Title Act. There has been $210 million to the native title industry; zilch of that has gone to the malnourished, homeless kids. Senator Faulkner selectively quoted my comments about native title in my newsletter to my constituents of Dickson. He referred to me as 'the member for Dickson, that paragon of moral rectitude'. I want to state my agreement with a number of general propositions. First, it is off limits for members of parliament to reflect on personal matters of other members. Secondly, parliament should not be used to improperly air personal grievances. Personal relationships are highly complex. Those between intimates are sacrosanct in a public sense. Thirdly, there is a clear lesson for all parliamentarians that hypocrisy never pays. Fourthly, if you fire off a cheap, gratuitous shot, of course it comes back to haunt you later. They mean nothing and they catch up with you in the end. Those statements were made, inter alia, by Senator Faulkner in commenting on former Senator Woods on 5 February 1997 at page 200 of the Weekly Senate Hansard. Senator Faulkner has had his cheap shot at me. Senator Faulkner has made a personal judgment on my morality. Heeding his words, I choose not to take this opportunity to pass any judgment on his. Aircraft Noise: Flight Paths in Sydney",150
226,Mr BRERETON,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise a matter that was dealt with in question time today in a question from the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey). It concerns the soon to be introduced new flight paths in respect of Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney. The honourable member asserted that the new flight paths, which I acknowledge he has been deeply involved in the design of, were going to realise the government's ambition to more fairly distribute aircraft movements over the Sydney basin and would lead to an equitable outcome for the area, acknowledging that aircraft always make noise and the airport will always have its environmental downside. I wanted to take this opportunity to put to the House what has actually happened since the government's last attempt to bring in new flight paths. That occurred in May of last year. During the period since that date we have had the opportunity to review the flight paths for some 16 months. It is noteworthy that, in respect of the noisiest operations, that is, take-offs from Kingsford Smith airport, during that period there has been a quite remarkable-indeed, quite dramatic-increase in the number of take-offs to the north, to the east and the west, but in all respects over residential areas. That increase in that period amounts to some 55 per cent over the number of take-offs over residential areas in the preceding 16-month period. The electorate, and the people of Sydney, who are always concerned about aircraft noise, should be aware, as I think they would be because they hear these planes, that there are now 55 per cent more take-offs over their homes on average than was the case in the preceding period. The potential tragedy is that, if one of these planes is to come downheaven forbid-there is a much greater likelihood of it being over a house, a preschool or a school than would be the case if the takeoffs were over the waters of Botany Bay. So not only are they noisier; there is a greater potential risk, and this is a very considerable downside of the new arrangements.",151

Another 595 Locally Engaged Staff (LES) in 88 missions were employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) to undertake DIMA functions under the supervision of DIMA, DFAT or Austrade staff. The visa function was managed by a DIMA APS officer in 43 missions, by a DFAT APS officer in 37 missions and by an Austrade Australian officer in 8 missions. (See Table A below for a detailed list.) All missions employ LES. At each of the 88 Australian visa-processing missions, non-DIMA APS staff (either DFAT or Austrade) and LES exercise delegations to make decisions to grant or refuse to grant a range of visa categories. (b) In 1996/97, 3,382,476 visas were granted and evidenced world wide at Australian missions with 92% of these being visitor visas. There were 567,276 visas (or 16.8% of the total) granted at NA Australian mISSIons where DIMA functions are managed by DFAT or Austrade officers. Delegations and decisions to grant visas Under sections 29 and 65 of the Migration Act 1958 the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has power to grant or refuse to grant a visa. The Minister delegates by instrument to all DIMA APS staff, DFAT APS staff, some Austrade staff and the majority of DIMA funded LES the power to grant or refuse a visa and to take all necessary steps leading to the determination of visa applications. These delegations are subject to a long standing administrative arrangement that work flows are controlled by supervisors so that delegates decide only those cases which are referred to them. (c) The rate of overstay for visitors at DIMA managed posts and non-DIMA managed posts is is 0.1 %; students at DIMA managed posts is 0.1 % and non-DIM A managed posts is 0.2%; and Temporary Residents at DIMA managed posts it is 0.3% and non-DIMA managed posts 0.1 %. (d) Before taking up an overseas posting, all Australia-based officers participate in an extensive program of formal training and briefings. The formal training program covers current and future immigration issues, lawful decision-making, processing of all permanent and temporary visa classes and related visa processing issues including health, character, bona fides testing, document fraud, electronic visas, agency arrangements and client issues. The briefings programs are tailored to the individual needs of the officer being posted and are organised in consultation with the post to which the officer has been assigned. DIMA also runs two or three courses each year (depending on demand) for DFAT and Austrade officers with delegation to grant or refuse visas. These courses cover lawful decision-making, health and character issues, processing issues. Individual DFAT and Austrade officers are also briefed by DIMA officers on request.

Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards: Recommendations (Question No. 2247) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: (1) Has the Government accepted and implemented all the recommendations, suggestions and proposals of the report into the Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards. (2) If not, (a) which recommendations, suggestions and proposals have not been accepted and implemented and (b) why were they rejected. Mrs Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards made a list of recommendations in its summary. The Government accepted all of these and has to date actioned all but the thirty-ninth proposal concerning recognition of the service of Officers and Instructors of Cadets. This matter is currently being investigated jointly between the Department of Defence and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. (2) In the case of proposals 15 and 21 investigatAustralia; ions were undertaken with the following results: Recommendation IS-Investigations found that as HMAS Vampire and Quickmatch visited Vietnam prior to it being declared a Special Services Area, and that the ships' visits were not in a warlike capacity, no provision exists to award the Returned from Active Service Badge. Recommendation 2I-lnvestigations found that neither Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, nor the Australian High Commission in Port Vila could find any evidence that a formal offer of the Vanuatu General Service Medal was ever made to Australia by the Vanuatu Government. As a result, the offer of the former President of Vanuatu is no longer available and, conseIstanbul Osaka Toronto vunctions have been withdrawn from other posts quently, it is not possible to proceed with this matter. Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel: United Kingdom Visit (Question No. 2284) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 25 September 1997: (1) Who accompanied, her on her recent trip to the United Kingdom. (2) Which organisation did each person referred to in part (1) represent. (3) Did each person accompany her for the entire journey; if not, for which parts of the journey did each person accompany her. Mrs Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) I was accompanied by the Chief of Staff of my Ministerial Office, and a Departmental Officer, the Director General of Defence's Exports suitable and International Programs Branch. The following companies were represented on the industry mission to the UK: ADI Limited; Aerospace and Defence Products; Australian Flight Testing Services; Australian Industry Defence Network; British Aerospace Buchanan Advanced Composites; Compucat; Defence Teaming Centre; Edson; Electro Optic Systems; GEC-Marconi Systems; Genasys IT; Hawker de Havilland; KEL Aerospace; LADS Corporation; Miltec Systems; Mincom; MITEC; Prism Pty Ltd (Vigil Antislip); QPSX Communications; Radio Frequency Systems; Siemens Plessey; Spantech; STN Atlas; Thomson Marconi Sonar; Transfield; Transfield Defence Systems; and Vision Abell. (3) My Chief of Staff accompanied me during my entire trip. The Director General of Defence's Exports and International Programs Branch accompanied me during all official meetings in the United Kingdom, but had other separate tasks to undertake during the visit. The company representatives were present at the Royal Navy British Army Equipment Exhibition 1997 as well as the DefencelDefence Manufacturers Association Seminar 'Promoting UK/Australian Defence Business Opportunities'. Australian Defence Force: Retirement (Question No. 2285) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 25 September 1997: Have certain Australian Defence Force members been required to retire before reaching 60 years of age; if so, (a) which members and (b) will those members who contribute to the Military Superannuation Benefits Scheme and discharge after 1 July 1999 be able to receive full payment of their superannuation at discharge; if not, (a) why not and (b) what restrictions will apply to their superannuation benefit payments. Mrs Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The compulsory retiring age for members of the Australian Defence Force is 55 years of age, except for senior officers at or above the rank of Major General (and equivalent). Some members may have elected to retain a compulsory retiring age earlier than 55 years of age, under arrangements that existed prior to 1995. Currently, members of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme can access their full benefit at age 55. The preservation age in the general community will not begin to increase until 2015 and will occur gradually over 10 years. In respect of the gradual increase in the preservation age, for particular occupation groups such as members of the Defence Force, who traditionally retire on or before age 55, individuals will continue to be able to obtain access to all or part of their preserved benefits before preservation age where the benefits withdrawn are taken in the form of a non-commutable life pension of lifetime annuity. After reaching the preservation age, individuals would be able to take any remaining benefit as a lump sum, provided they are no longer in paid employment. Antipersonnel Landmines (Question No. 2304) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 30 September 1997: Has his attention been drawn to the fifth report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties regarding blinding laser weapons and land mines; if so, will the Government destroy Australia's stockpile of anti-personnel land mines in accordance with the recommendation of the majority report of the committee. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government tabled a Response to the fifth Report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in the Senate on 21 August 1997, and in the House of Representatives on 23 September 1997. The Government announced on 17 November 1997 that Australia would sign the Convention on the Prohibition, Stockpiling and Transfer of Antipersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction-also known as the Ottawa Treaty-when it is opened for signature in Ottawa on 3-4 December 1997. The Government's decision means that the Australian Defence Force's stockpile of antipersonnel land mines will be destroyed, consistent with the provisions of the Ottawa Treaty. Live Ammunition Firing: Training (Question No. 2337) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 2 October 1997: (1) What qualifications do Army personnel require to conduct 25mm range live fire training of reservists. (2) What responsibilities do the Army personnel have on the range when conducting training. (3) What occupational health and safety equipment is required to be present on the range when conducting training. (4) What ongoing education or training do personnel need to undertake to maintain these qualifications. (5) How long have the current training and education - equirements been in place. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Range practices involving the live fire of small arms on 25 metre ranges are to be conducted by qualified personnel. To be qualified to plan, conduct and supervise range practices, personnel need to have successfully completed an appropriate course of instruction. Details of the course, including the date and specific qualifications gained are to be recorded on the members file and on the course report. Range qualifications are valid for service in the ARA, GRes and Army Cadet Corps. (2) Responsibilities during the conduct of range training: Officer in Charge of Practice (OIC)-The OIC must be present on the range during firing and must be positioned so that he can control all aspects of the practice. The OICs are responsible for the orders given, the safe conduct of the practice and the safety of all personnel under their control. The OICs are also responsible for the briefing of all participants on casualty and evacuation procedure. Safety Supervisor-Only qualified members may be appointed as safety supervisors. The safety supervisors are responsible for the safety of their allocated firers and the safe conduct of their tasks in accordance with the directions of the Ole. In the case of live fire 25 m practices, one safety supervisor per 10 firers is required if a daylight practice, one to five firers if a night practice and one per firer if it is an introductory or familiarisation practice (recruits only). Chief Safety Officer-Officers or Warrant Officers may be appointed as chief safety officers responsible to oversee all matters of safety in the conduct of a practice. Chief safety officers are to be qualified as OIC practice for all ranges under their control. .(3) A soldier trained in first aid and equipped wIth a stretcher and a first aid kit including shell dressings must be present. A vehicle capable of transporting a patient on a stretcher must be present at all times. Hearing protection is to be worn by personnel participating in all live fire activities. authorised forms of hearing protection available are disposable (clean, dry fibre glass earplugs or compressible resin polymer earplugs) or nondisposable (rubber earplugs or aural protectors). The OIC is not to commence the practice until everyone has complied with this regulation. (4) Once a qualification is gained, it remains valid. In the case of new weapons entering service, safety staff are required to be trained and requalify in accordance with the Directorate of Infantry's Training Management Plan. Present doctrine requires all personnel to undertake refresher training and pass annual weapon testing on the F88 Steyr as part of the Army Individual Readiness Notice initiative. (5) The policy in relation to qualifications of personnel appointed to conduct a range practice and the procedure for conducting a range practice have been in place for many years; however, in respect of the terminology 'current' as used in the question, the present training references were approved 27 March 1996. Medical Radioisotopes (Question No. 2345) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 2 October 1997: (1) Have there been delays in the shipment to Australia of medical radioisotopes during periods when the reactor at Lucas Heights is shut down for maintenance; if so, what is the extent and frequency of the delays. (2) Has he or his Department received complaints from medical professionals during the past 2 years about delays in the importation of medical radioisotopes; if so, what are the details of the complaints.",151
228,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,TABLE A,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Hon J. Moore MP, as Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, has advised the following response: There have been delays in the shipment of medical radioisotopes. During the last major maintenance shut-down of the High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR) (September to December 1995) Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) imported a range of radioisotopes. ANSTO has confirmed that there were significant delays on a number of occasions, and the activity of some shipments had decayed to levels that left the product useless. Delays are caused by factors such as unscheduled The transshipment at intermediate stopping points, and the effects of international and national air transport regulations. Where a package experiences a transport disruption, this usually results in the carrier delivering it at least 24 hours later than scheduled. ANSTO has imported some radioisotope products since the last major shut-down of HIFAR and has advised that delays have continued to occur. (2) Yes. I have received complaints. However, they were by way of personal communication to me. I do not intend to make such private communication public. National Gallery of Australia: Exhibitions (Question No. 2380) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, upon notice, on 21 October 1997: What have been the sources, titles and dates of blockbuster exhibitions conducted by the National Gallery of Australia. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The sources, titles and dates of blockbuster exhibitions conducted by the National Gallery of Australia are as follows: Year Title Venue 1984 The Great Impres- NGA sionists (Courtauld exhibition) 1986 Twentieth-Century NGA Masters from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York 1986 Twentieth-Century QAG Masters from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York 1987 Old Masters-New NGA Visions from The Phillips Collection, Washington DC 1989 The Art of Pho- NGA tography: 1839-1989 1990 Civilization: An- NGA cient Treasures from the British Museum 1992 Rubens and the NGA Italian Renaissance 1992 The Age of Angkor: NGA Treasures from the National Museum of Cambodia 1992 Rembrandt to NGA Renoir: European Masterpieces from The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco 1993 Surrealism: Revo- NGA lution by Night Dates Sources 02106/84-06/08/84 Courtauld Institute 01/03/86-27/04/86 Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York 07/05/86-01/07/86 0311 0/87-06/12187 The Phillips Collection, Washington DC AGWA 22/12/87-21/02188 AGSA 04/03/88-01/05/88 16/06/89-27/08/89 462 works, 76 lenders, principally from USA 24/03/90-11106/90 British Museum, London MoV 28/06/90-23/09/90 28/03/92-08106192 78 works, 28 lenders, principally from Italy NGV 20/06192-30108/92 22108/92-25/10/92 National Museum of Cambodia 12111192-31/01193 Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco NGV 19/02193-10/05193 08/03/93-02105193 151 works, 86 lenders, principally from USA QAG 21105193-11107/93 AGNSW 30/07/93-19109/93 Year Title 1993 Dressed to Kill: 100 1994 European Master1995 The Queen's Pic1995196 The Vision of 1996 Turner 1996 Paris: in the Late Acronyms AGNSW Art Gallery of New South Wales AGSA Art Gallery of South Australia AGWA Art Gallery of Western Australia MoV Museum of Victoria NGA National Gallery of NGV National Gallery of Victoria QAG Queensland Art Gallery TM&AG Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery Defence Medal: Review (Question No. 2417) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 23 October 1997: (1) Is she able to say whether the Coalition's 1996 election policy statement included a promise to review the eligibility criteria for the Defence Medal.

Mrs Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (a) The review took into account all the concerns highlighted to the Government by veterans and their organisations. (b) The review found that no clear anomaly or manifest injustice had occurred in its issue against the original intent of the award. Therefore, it was recommended that the eligibility criteria for the Defence Medal should not be changed. The Interdepartmental Committee on Honours and Awards to Defence Personnel also reviewed the conclusions of the Department of Defence and agreed to the findings. (c) The Government has accepted the findings of the review. Department of Social Security: Charities (Question No. 2425) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 23 October 1997: Has the Minister's Department provided funding to charities in (a) 1994-95, (b) 1995-96 and (c) (c) (i) Braille & Talking Book Library of Victoria (Question No. 2442) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 30 October 1997: Are there international fora for the discussion of issues, and the dissemination of information, relating to landcare; if so, (a) what are they, (b) what is the extent and nature of Australia's participation in them; and (c) does Australia obtain a benefit from participating in them; if so, what. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There are international fora that emerge' from time to time and Australia does use these opportunities to promote its approach to and successes with landcare and with sustainable natural resource management generally. The most important of these fora at this time is in the ongoing negotiations to ratify and implement the International Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Expe1996-97: if so, (i) to which charities and (ii) what sums were provided. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Since charitable status has not been a qualification for receiving payments from the Department of Social Security, it is not possible to determine whether every organisation to which a payment has been made over the period in question was a registered charity. The following reply is based on payments to organisations which it has been possible to identify as such. (a) No payments identified. (b) No payments identified. However, funding was approved for a number of community organisations, some of which may have been charities, for Community Research Projects. Payments for these projects were made during 1995-96 and 1996-97. A listing of these organisations is at pages 436-439 of the Department of Social Security Annual Report 1995-96. (ii) $33,000 Landcare riencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa. Australia is also participating in the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development and in the activities for promoting sustainable development carried out by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Australia does benefit from this participation. The Convention to Combat Desertification provides an opportunity to promote the export of Australian technology and expertise, and the approach promote- by the Convention draws heavily on Australia's experience with the community based landcare movement. Technologies that have been promoted through landcare include remote sensing, drought management, geographical information systems, sustainable agriculture techniques and practices, and also technology aimed at improving communication and energy efficiency such as wind and solar electricity generation. In addition, the work of the OECD provides an ongoing and important opportunity for Australia to encourage the removal of agricultural support mechanisms used by overseas countries that are environmentally damaging to those countries themselves and that limit the potential for improved agricultural trade by Australia. I also expect that landcare and sustainable agriculture will be receiving further international attention in the context of Australia's response to the management of greenhouse gas emissions. Australia will also have an excellent opportunity to promote land care at the proposed International Landcare Conference, to be held in Melbourne in the year 2000. Efforts to promote landcare internationally need to take into account the extent to which landcare reflects Australian cultural, social, economic and agricultural conditions. Much of landcare's success so far derives from the targeting of decision making by land managers and of managing continuing change through continued learning. These issues can be very culturally specific, involving aspects such as land ownership and land management responsibilities and relationships, educational arrangements and access, and the social structures of rural communities. The factors that are critical to the success of landcare therefore need to be understood if the landcare model is to be transferable to other countries. Social Security Fraud: Reporting (Question No. 2443) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 30 October 1997: (1) What procedures exist for citizens to report circumstances of social security fraud to the Minister's Department. (2) What is the investigating policy of the Minister's Department after reports have been made. (3) Is a complainant informed of the progress of an investigation. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Centrelink have a number of procedures available for citizens to report circumstances of suspected social security fraud. These are: by phoning a Centrelink Call Centre on the toll free number 13 2468. The majority of public information comes from calls to the Call Centres; by phoning, faxing, writing or visiting any of the Customer Service Centres, Area Support Office, National Support Office or the Minister for Social Security's offices. Also, information from citizens is sometimes referred from other government departments and agencies and Members of Parliament. (2) All allegations reported to Centrelink are investigated, providing the person about whom the allegations are being made can be identified as a past or present customer, and appropriate action taken. The majority of cases are actioned by Mobile Review Teams (MRTs) based in Area Support Offices. The procedures for processing public information allegations are set out in a staff instruction, and a copy has been made available to your office. (3) In cases where the complainant provides their name and address, acknowledgment of the information is usually sent to them. However, the Privacy Act 1988 and section 1312 of the Social Security Act 1991 generally prohibit the disclosure of information about any of Centrelink's customers. Therefore complainants are not informed of the progress of an investigation. While Centrelink's inability to report the results of any investigation may be mistaken for inactivity, this is certainly not the case. It should also be noted that the vast majority of complainants wish to remain anonymous. Indonesian Bushfires: Fire Fighting Procedures Aircraft (Question No. 2457) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 30 October 1997: (1) Which aircraft is the Government using to assist in the fight against bushfires in Indonesia. (2) Who owns or leases the aircraft. (3) Have the aircraft been used to fight fires in South Australia; if so, (a) how many hours have they spent in the air fighting fires and (b) what was the cost. (4) Will the Government be paying for the use of the aircraft; if so, whom will it pay. (5) What is the cost to the Government for the use of the aircraft and how is it calculated. (6) What is the hourly cost of operating the aircraft. (7) Was the advice of Emergency Management Australia (EMA) sought in relation to the suitability and cost effectiveness of the aircraft for their planned use in Indonesia; if so, what advice was given; if not, why not. (8) Was the Commonwealth/State review of firefighting, conducted in 1994 following the Sydney fires, taken into account prior to the decision; if not, why not. (9) Is he able to say whether it is the assessment of EMA that specialist firefighting aircraft, such as the Canadair type, are only of use in the early stages of a fire and then best engaged against softwood fires, not natural hardwood fires. (10) Is he able to say whether every firefighting authority in Australia, with the exception of South Australian authorities, share a similar view to that of EMA on this issue. (11) Is he able to say whether the South Australian Government, its departments or agencies, or the South Australian based company, National J etstream, stands to gain by the Federal Government's use of the aircraft. (12) Does the relocation of the aircraft to Indonesia threaten South Australia's firefighting capability; if so, how. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The South Australian Country Fire Service (SACFS), as the Contractor employed by AusAID, used two Air Tractor (AT 802) aircraft for aerial fire bombing in Indonesia. (2) The two aircraft were engaged by SACFS from Australian Maritime Resources Pty Ltd, which owns the aircraft. (3) Aircraft of a slightly smaller capacity (AT 502) have been used regularly for firefighting in South Australia. (a) On average, 300 hours have been flown annually. (b) The cost is $2000 per aircraft per standby day, and $1200 per hour for operations. (4) The Contract for the aerial water bombing in Indonesia was between the SACFS and the Commonwealth represented by AusAID. The Commonwealth will reimburse the SACFS for the costs associated with use of the aircraft. (5) The final costs have not been resolved but the estimated cost is $539 000 comprising $110 000 for ferrying the aircraft, $325 000 for operations and $104 000 for the time the aircraft were on standby. (6) The hourly cost for an aircraft is $1 500 per flying hour, inclusive of fuel, and $2 000 per day while on standby. (7) EMA was approached by AusAID for information on the availability of Australian-based aerial water bombing assets following a request from the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs. EMA was not requested for advice in relation to the suitability and operations in Indonesia; however, advice was obtained by AusAID from Australian fire authorities which indicated that the Australian aircraft would be suitable for operations against small scale spot fires. (8) The 1994 review of firefighting included a recommendation to 'Broaden AFAC's (Australasian Fire Authorities Council) position paper on ""Use of Aircraft in Firebombing in Australia"" to further detail a position of the role of aircraft operational applications during wildfires.' Subsequently, a revised position paper was endorsed by AFAC and has provided a non-mandatory basis on which rural fire agencies have employed firebombing aircraft. The 1994 review does not provide a definitive basis for deciding on the suitability of such aircraft. (9) The understanding of EMA is that firebombing can be carried out using a range of aircraft types, and involves the dropping of water, retardant or foam mixtures on to fires burning in natural fuels. For firebombing to be efficient and effective, it is important that the most suitable aircraft types be chosen; that competent aviation management personnel direct the firebombing operations; that effective ground support and administration systems are in place; and air operations are effectively integrated into the total fire organisation. While such aircraft are suitable in many situations, as has been demonstrated with the softwood forests in Canada, they are not necessarily appropriate for direct attack on major Australian hardwood conflagrations burning at extreme intensities. In these cases, other less direct approaches are required, such as suppressing spot fires caused by windborne embers. (10) All firefighting authorities in Australia, including South Australia, support the AFAC position paper 'Use of Aircraft for Fire Bombing in Australia'. The EMA assessment is based on this position paper. (11) The contract between AusAID and the SACFS was on a cost-recovery basis only, with no net financial benefit accruing to the SACFS. The Government is not aware of any benefit or gain which would accrue to the company National Jetstream. I am advised that this company was not involved in the Indonesian aerial water bombing operation. (12) While the fire danger season in areas of South Australia commences on 1 November, aerial bombing cover does not commence until 1 December. As the SACFS contract ended on 2 November, the relocation of the aircraft to Indonesia did not threaten South Australian firefighting capability. If anything, it made both SACFS and Australian Maritime Resources better prepared for the forthcoming cost effectiveness for season. Schofields Airport: Sale (Question No. 2462) . Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 30 October 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 28 October 1997 referring to potential sales of various property covering all owned by the Government. (2) Is the area of land in the electoral division Greenway known as Schofields Airport targeted for sale; if so, (a) when will it be sold and (b) for what development purposes will the land be used after the sale. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday, 25 October 1997. The article contained a number of inaccurate statements which I corrected in a subsequent letter to the Editor which was published on 5 November 1997. (2) The 170 hectare Schofields property has been declared surplus to Defence requirements and is earmarked for disposal. Defence has engaged a team of planning consultants to examine future land use options. (a) The site has a current zoning of Special Uses Defence. As such, it is not included on the NSW Urban Development Program (UDP).
