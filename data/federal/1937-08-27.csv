7,Sir ARCHDALE PARKHILL,Unknown,"As trial honourable members know, certain negotiacommunity, tions took place some months ago.

12,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,In view of the fact' that the majority of the air-minded youth of the Commonwealth come from induscentres and the poorer classes of the will the Minister for Defence was state whether the Government has considered the subsidizing of fees charged by civil aviation companies for the training,10
13,Sir ARCHDALE PARKHILL,Unknown,"I desire to say, in the first place, that the airmen of the Commonwealth are drawn from all classes of society. This matter far was given consideration, and the view held so far is that it is advisable that training of airmen should be done through the air force, as is the case in Great Britain, as that practice, because of the excellent training they receive, gives short commissioned pilots an opportunity later to obtain employment in the civil aviation services. It is for that reason that, up to the present, no encouragement has been given to the proposition that the Government should subsidize private colleges for the training of pilots. The matter is, however, receiving further consideration. WIRELESS BROADCASTING. LICENCE-FEE.",10
14,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"Is the Minister representing the Postmaster-General aware that postal inspectors have gone through the Newcastle area and prosecuted many unemployed who are using wireless receiving sets without having a licence to do so ?

Will the honourable gentleman withdraw any pending prosecutions, and give sympathetic consideration to the reduction of the licence fee in the case of those who are unemployed ?",11
15,Sir ARCHDALE PARKHILL,Unknown," Naturally, I am unaware of the circumstances which the honourable member says exist. I would only say that in the ordinary conduct of the business of the Postal Department, supervision is exercised to ascertain who pays the licence-fee and who does not. I assure ihe House that no discrimination whatever is shown in the making of these inquiries. I can say quite emphatically that these inspectors have not been asked to go through the coal-fields, or specially to prosecute unemployed persons. I shall, however, bring the matter to the notice of the Postmaster-General.",11

24,Mr CASEY,PARLIAMENTARY,"Corio - Treasurer) [10.43] - It affords the Government a great deal of satisfaction that, in this year in which it has to render its account to the people of the Commonwealth, it can call attention to a. higher level of material prosperity than has been experienced since the onset of the depression. Indeed it can be said that the present level of prosperity is higher than it has ever been in the previous history of this country. This is a statement of which there is no lack of proof of a convincing character. No matter where we look we find a continuous record of achievement and improvement in the economic sphere. Production has reached peak after peak, prices have improved, unemployment has diminished, real wages are higher, savings bank deposits have reached record levels, arid the overseas trade position has shown a remarkable improvement. Conditions in the sphere of private finance are equally satisfactory. Monetary conditions are easy, and the Government's policy has assisted in restraining any unhealthy tendency towards increasing interest rates. The position of the banks is sound, and ample credit facilities are available for.creditworthy borrowers. INTERNAL RECOVERY : EMPLOYMENT. From the social point of view the most pro*- important measure of improvement is the unemployment situation. The bestsingle index available over the whole in the period is the unemployment percentages reported by the trade unions to the Commonwealth Statistician. These figures reached their peak of 30 per cent, in the second quarter of 1932, shortly after the Government took office. As honourable members are aware, unemployment has consistently and regularly declined, quarter by quarter, since that time, - until today the percentage is Indeed, there is good reason to believe that the improvement has been even greater than these figures indicate. A more complete measure available for New Wales shows that only 6.5 per cent, of all dependent on and available for to employment were unemployed in June, 1937, compared with 26.5 per cent, in June, 1933. If the full-time equivalent of part-time relief work is included a3 i-mpioyment the present percentage is still further reduced to 5.3 per cent. A similar figure for men wage-earners in Queensland, based partly on statistics available from the unemployment insurance scheme, is 5.7 per cent. Confirmation of the accuracy of .this analysis is afforded by the statistics of employment in factories. In 1928-29 there were 450,000 employed. The number fell to. 337,000 in 1931-32. It then increased steadily year by year until in 1936-37 there were approximately 518,000 persons employed full-time in Australian factories, a much larger number than has ever been recorded before in the history of the Commonwealth. Moreover, this is an average for the year and it is mated that the number employed in June, 1937, was approximately 535,000. This represents a volume of factory employment of 19 per cent, above that of 1928-29. The increase since 1931-32 means that on the average no less than 36,000 persons have gone into full-time factory employment in each of the intervening years. This is for factory employment alone. If employment throughout Australia be taken into account more than 500,000 persons have obtained full-time employment since 1931-32-a n average of nearly 95,000 per year. INTERNAL RECOVERY: PRODUCTION Increased production has marched hand in hand with diminished unemployment. The value of our recorded material production rose from £305,000,000 in 1931-32 to about £432,000,000 in 1936-37. Allowing for lower price levels, the physical volume of production in the year just closed was far in excess of that of anypre-depression peak year. Building and construction, which is not included in the above-mentioned production figures, has increased since the depths of the depression at an even more remarkable rate. Comparable records are available only for the six capital cities and their suburbs and cerEXTERNAL tain country districts, but the allAustralia figures, which have been estimated by the Commonwealth Statistician, show an increase from Mr Casey. slightly over £8,000,000 in 1931-32 to the very high figure of £43,000,000 in 1936-37. In the case of iron and steel output, the Australian production at the end of the last financial year was about double that of 1928-29. EXTERNAL RECOVERY"": EXPORT PRICES. The relation of our internal prosperity to export prices and the volume of export production is too well-known to need emphasis. Dominating the situation in the year jusi ended was the high price of wool. Wool prices reached rock-bottom in 1931-32, the clip bringing only £35,000,000. There have since been wide variations of the price of wool. In esti1936-37, the average price was 16.48d. per lb., and the clip realized £66,900,000 - no t far from double the value of that of 1931-32. Present quotations are somewhat above this price. The wheat market also improved remarkably, largely on account of unfavorable crop conditions in oversea countries, which reduced world stocks to very low levels. Those concerned with wheat production will need no reminder of the disastrous consequences of the reduction of the price of wheat from about 4s. 8d. a bushel in 1928-29 to as low as 2s. 8d. in 1930-31. and its continued low level until well into 1935. The value of our wheat crop was £38,300,000 in 1928-29. It fell to £25,000,000 in 1930-31""and to £21,000,000 in 1934-35. In the year recently closed it brought £39,200,000. Substantially increased prices have also been recorded in other important export commodities, notably in butter, meat and metals. There was an all-round increase of 20 per cent, in export prices in 1936-37 as compared even with the satisfactory level of 1935-36. It is sufficient to say in this connection that a few months ago the average Australian currency price of all our exports touched the same level as the average for 1928. RECOVERY: OVERSEA TRADE. The total value of. our exports-including gold and silver-in 1936-37 was £126,200,000 sterling. The value of our imports was £90,500,000 sterling. Of the favourable balance of £35,700,000 sterling a little over £22,000,000 sterling was required for Government and local body interest, in addition to several millions of pounds for sinking fund remittances. After allowing for the net effect of other inward and outward payments, it is estimated that our total credits were sufficient to settle ail our oversea ties and add the substantial sum of something like £20,000,000 sterling to our reserves of London funds. A corresponding improvement took place in the liquid reserves of the banking system. This result has been achieved in a year which opened with much criticism of the Government's financial and economic policy. If the critics had had their way, the Government would have undertaken unnecessary experiments in monetary policy which might have had serious consequences. While imports in the year recently ended were rather higher than in 1935-36, there has been little increase of imports of goods competitive with Australian production. Of the £7,000,000 increase £5,000,000 was in non-competitive lines, mainly raw materials, machinery and petrol. The increased employment in Australian factories!, to which' 1I have already referred, is sufficient evidence that Australian industry was in no way prejudiced. An analysis of our imports shows, indeed, that about 50 per cent, of our total imports are raw materials of industry, 14J per cent, capital equipment for industry, and about 12 per cent, motor vehicles and parts and petrol. Only about 23-J per cent, consist offinishedconsumers' goods, and a substantial proportion of these is of a kind not competitive with Australian industry. I can, therefore, conclude this brief review of the present economic position on an optimistic note. Employment and production expanded during last year - as indeed they have throughout the Government's term of office-at a satisfactory rate. The price disparities between primary and secondary products which were so marked in the depression years have been almost entirely removed, and export prices in particular are very favourable. London reserves have been greatly strengthened, and the banking system is comfortably liquid. PUBLIC DEBT. Since the Lyons Government' assumed office in December, 1931, the public debt of the Commonwealth, as distinct from that of the States, has been reduced by £11.019,000. Particulars of the debt are as follow:£ liabiliCommonwealth Public Debt at 31st December, 1931 .. . . 397,929,000 Commonwealth Public Debt at 30th .Time, 1937 . . . . 380,910,000 Decrease .. 11,019,000 In the five-and-a-half-yearperiod, the average rates of interest payable in London and in Australia in respect of the aggregate Australian public debt steadily fell, the figures being- 3lst December, 1981. 30th June, 1937. £ s. d. £ a. d.

Between October, 1932, and June, 1936, all maturing and optional redeemable loans domiciled in London were converted at progressively improving rates of interest. These loans totalled £198,000,000 and the annual amount of the savings in interest and exchange was approximately £4,000,000. A further conversion of £12,360,000 was arranged in June, 1937, resulting in an additional saving in respect of interest and exchange of £46,000 per annum. The yield to the investor on the new loan issued in London in June last was £3 16s. 2d. per cent.",12

27,Mr CURTIN,PARLIAMENTARY,Not at all! OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Withdraw !,15
28,Mr CASEY,PARLIAMENTARY,"Not only shall I not withdraw, but I also repeat what I said previously; the Leader of the Opposition is twisting figures - balance",15
29,Mr CURTIN,PARLIAMENTARY,I ask that that statement be withdrawn. I used no figure but that which appears in the document from which the Treasurer is reading. I did not invent any figures.,15
30,Mr CASEY,PARLIAMENTARY,The honourable member does not like the presentation of these figures.,15
31,Mr SCULLIN,PARLIAMENTARY,"It can easily be seen that an election is approaching. Mr .CASEY - At the time of this issue, the London market was considerably disturbed by uncertainty in regard to the future of gold and by conditions Europe. Further loans totalling £11,410,000 will mature in London on the 1st February, 1938, and must bo dealt with before that date. Internal Loans. During 1936-37, two loans of £7,500,000 each were issued in the Australian market debts. under the auspices of the Loan Council. The first issue in November, 1936, gave a yield to the investor of £3 19s. 4d. per cent, per annum, whilst the yield from the second loan, issued in April, 1937, was £3 19s. Id. per cent, per annum. Of the November, 1936, loan, £2,000,000 was left in the hands of the underwriters. For some months afterwards interest yields from Commonwealth securities showed a rising tendency. This was slightly checked before the issue of the April loan, and in later months yields from our securities continued to fall. At the present time, the loan issued in April, 1937, at £3 19s. shows a return on the market of a little less than £3 16s. You The Loan Council has decided to limit its raisings for State and Commonwealth loan purposes for 1937-38 to £16,000,000. The Commonwealth share of this amount will be £2,500,000 all of which is to be used for grants to the States for farmers' debt adjustment. On the 15th December, 1938, internal Australian consolidated stock and bonds totalling approximately £72,700,000 will mature. The bulk of this loan now carries interest at 4 per cent., and the bears interest at 3 per cent. The conversion of this loan will be a task of considerable magnitude, and it is highly important that everything possible should be done to keep market conditions favourable for a successful conversion, on satisfactory terms. National Debt Sinking Fund. The operations of the sinking fund are now assuming considerable importance. In the present financial year the receipts will for the first time exceed £10,000,000. The amount to be provided for State sinking funds is £5,580,000, whilst £4,630,000 in will be payable to the Commonwealth sinking fund- a total for the fund as a whole of .£10,210,000. Since the establishment of the sinking fund in 1923, over £75,000,000 has been provided for the redemption of Commonwealth debt, whilst, in addition, since States' sinking funds were established in 1928, over £37,000,000 has been paid to the fund for the redemption of State Aggregate Australian Public Debt. The movement in the aggregate public debt of the Commonwealth and the States is shown in the following table:£ Total Commonwealth and State debt at the 31st December, 1031 .. .. 1,182,50G,000"" Total Commonwealth and State debt at the 30th June, 1037 .. 1,262,872,000 Ifet increase in five and one-half year period .. 80,306,000 Id. As has already been stated, the public debt of the Commonwealth itself decreased in this period by £11,019,000. State and Commonwealth Budget State budget results continue to improve.

The reduction now proposed will bring the total down to £15,658,000. In the present financial year, the Postal Department requires £3,250,000 for postal, telegraph and telephone works which are urgently necessary to meet public requirements. Money market conditions make it undesirable for the Commonwealth to raise any of this money by loan. Accordingly, the Government proposes to apply £1,000,000 of last year's excess receipts to works of the Postmaster-General's Department and to provide the balance of £2,250,000 from the general revenues of this year. 3937-38 EnvAKC£\s. Taxation. The Government has given serious consideration to the subject of taxation in connection with its financial proposals for 1937-3S. I wish to pass in review before honourable members the taxation record of this Government since it assumed office in December, 1.93.1. It is a record in which the Government takes some pride, not only for the extent and value of the reductions effected, but. also for the manner in which the relief has been distributed among all members of the community. The reductions began in 1932-33, in w hich year a flat exemption of £250 per annum of income from property was substituted for the sliding scale previously in operation under the special property tax. Land tax was reduced by 33-J per cent. Sundry exemptions were granted from sales tax and from customs primage duties largely in relation to primary production. In 1933-34, very extensive reductions of taxation were made in the income tax field. The rate of the company tax was reduced from about Is. 5d. to Is. Taxation of life assurance companies was adjusted so that taxation was only charged on the excess income after allowing a deduction of 4 per cent, on the valuation of liabilities. The personal exertion rate was reduced by 15 per cent. The special tax on property was reduced from 10 per cent, to 6 per cent. The previous year's reduction of the land tax rate was increased from 33J per cent, to 50 per cent. Entertainments tax was. abolished altogether. Mr Casey. The sales tax rate was reduced from 6 per cent, to 5 per cent, and sundry extensive exemptions were granted to primary industry, medicines, food, building material, &c. Customs (British preferential) and excise duties were greatly eased both in general and, in particular, on the following: Primage duties were reduced from 10 per cent. to 5 per cent, and in some cases to 4 per cent., beer duties were reduced by 3d. per gallon; and the duties on tea were reduced by Id . per lb., and by the removal of the 10 per cent, primage. Customs and excise duties were substantially reduced on spirits and on benzol. In 1934-35, further exemptions were granted from the incidence of sales tax, again chiefly in respect of primary products, building material, and foodstuffs. Extensive reductions of and exemptions from primage duties were also granted. In 3935-38, the special tax on property was reduced from 6 per cent, to 5 per cent., and further exemptions were made from salestax and primage. Excise duties on Australian-grown tobacco were lowered. The budget for the year 1936-37 provided very extensive taxation reductions. I ii income taxation, the special tax on property was abolished, the personal exertion and property rates were lowered by 10 per cent., a £50 deduction from income was granted in respect of a dependent wife or female relative. The rate of sales tax was reduced from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent., and a widespread range of further exemptions - of necessaries of life was granted. Substantial primage exemptions were granted on certain articles of British manufacture. The taxation reductions of which I have spoken have been of great benefit to all sections of the community, and are positive evidence of the desire of the Government to keep th« taxation burden to a minimum. I think I can best convey to honourable members the effect of this series of reductions in the rates of taxation by saying that, if the sales tax had remained today at the same rate and on the same field as in 1.931-32, we should be collecting no less than £18.000,000 from sales tax instead of the £7,700,000 that we expect to collect this year. Similarly, in the case of income tax, we should be collecting £15,500,000 on the 1931-32 basis instead of £9,000,000 as estimated this year, whilst land tax would be yielding £3,000,000 instead of £1,500,000. These thr.ee taxes combined would have been yielding £36,500,000 at the 1931-32 rates, instead of the £18,200,000 included in the budget for the current year. In other words, taking these three major fields of federal taxation into account, the Government has, in effect, lialved the burden on the Australian people. In view of its formidable and inescapable increased obligations for the immediate future, the Government regrets that it is unable still further to reduce taxation in this financial year. REVENUE SUMMABV, 1937-38. The total estimated revenue for the year is £85,190,000, made up as make follows:/ )epariments and General £ ServtoenCustoms and excise.. 44,500,000 Sales tax . . .. 7,700,000 Land tax . . 1,500,000 Income tax .. 0,000,000 Estate duty 1,050,000 Miscellaneous .. 3.330,000 1'usiness UndertakingsPost Office . -10.700,000 Railways . . .. 480,000 Territories . . .. lNVAi.ro ANDOLD - A GE PENSIONS. Between 1933 and 1936, the average annual increased expenditure on invalid and old-age pensions was £675,000. In September, 1936, the rate of pension was increased from 18s. to 19s., which resulted in expenditure in the year recently ended of practically £14,000,000-an increase of £1,200,000 over the previous year. On the 30th June, 1937, there were practically 300,000 invalid and old-age pensioners. The net annual increase of their numbers is approximately 12,000. The Government is now glad to be in a position to increase the rate of pension from 19s. to £1. The expenditure for 1937-38 will bo approximately £15,900,000, an increase of practically £2,000,000 over that of last 3'ear. This increase is accounted for in three ways: by the normal growth in the numbers of pensioners, by the cost of the additional shilling-a n annual cost of about £800,000-and by the fact that, in this financial year, there happen to bb 27 instead of the normal 26 fortnightly pension pay-days. DEFENCE. In his statement to the Parliament on the Imperial Conference, the Prime Minister has dealt with the discussions on Empire defence and the principles that should govern the development of Australian defence. As has been announced by the Prime Minister, the Government has decided to substantial provision in this budget for a further 3tage in the strengthening of our defences. £ The total financial provision for ° defence from all sources in 1937-38, including commitments, is £11,531,000. The actual expenditure for defence from all sources in 1936-37 was : 07,080,00 0 £8,067,000. The increased provision in this financial year is formidable, but ' the Government is convinced that it is 17.180.000 no more than is essential in the world .. 330,000 conditions that exist. 85,100,000 The approximate allocation of the £11,500,000 as between the various services is as follows:£ Navy .. .. .. 3,610,000 Military - . . .. .. 3.204.000 Ai r force . . .. .. 2,072,000 Civil aviation .. 040,000 Munitions supply .. .. 1,030,000 11,531,000 Honourable members will readily appreciate the great difficulty that faced the Government in setting out to make financial provision for defence expenditure of the high order of £11,500,000, an amount greater by nearly £3,500,000 than that expended last financial year. This problem was made more difficult by the necessity to make provision for substantially increased expenditure over and above that of last year in several other directions, notably £2,000,000 for invalid and old age pensions, £700,000 for increased payments to the States for federal aid roads, £830,000 for post office works, £1,000,000 for rural debt adjustment, and £200,000 for youth employment. It may be asked why the Government does not attempt to spread this largelyincreased provision for defence over a longer period of time than one financial year. The reason is that all the Government's proposals for increased defence expenditure are essential, and time is the essence of the contract. All the proposals have to be put in hand at the earliest possible moment. Defence expenditure is not translated into actual armaments overnight. Of necessity a considerable period of time must elapse between the voting of the money and the resultant increased strength of our fighting services. The Government is, therefore, convinced that the whole of its present programme should be undertaken now in the interests of the security of Australia. So far as defence expenditure is concerned, there are four sources of finance available-the budget, the defence ment trust account, the civil aviation trust account, and the loan fund. As honourable members are aware, Government has adopted the practice in past years of paying into the defence equipment trust account as much as posfor sible of the excess of receipts over exnence penditure at the close of each financial year, and of drawing on this fund, which has, of course, been created from revenue of past years, to assist the budget in respect of defence expenditure in subsary sequent years. The transactions in this connection have been explained in detail in the last three budget speeches. year 1936-37 closed with approximately £3,000,000 to the credit of the defence trust accounts. We propose to expend commit the whole of this sum in the shall current financial years towards making later stage. financial provision for defence. I have used the words "" expend or comment mit"" advisedly, as it is improbable that the whole of the Government's orders Mr Ca$ey. defence equipment will fall due for payment in 1937-38, but, as the whole amount will be committed, I believe it is only right so to inform the Parliament and to make provision for its possible expenditure. We propose, in addition, to appropriate from the budget for this same purposea sum of £6,000,000, which is the maximum amount that it is possible to carry on general revenue without increasing the existing rates of taxation, and having regard to the heavy additional charges that the budget has to carry in other directions. The sources of revenue that I have mentioned account for £9,000,000 towards the £11,500,000 for which financial provision has to be made. The Government proposes to find the rem'aiiiing £2,500,000 for defence from loan. Bearing in mind the circumstances of the times, together with the fact that we are obliged to carry on the budget a considerable volume of what would normally be loan expenditure, the. Government believes that it is fully justified in making provision for £2,500,000 of defence expenditure from loan. The circumstances that lead up to this equipdecision are as follows:As.honourable members will be aware, the loan council is endeavouring to limit the its demands on the Australian money market to a total of £16,000,000 for all governments in 1937-3S. The necessity this largely arises out of the immiof the loan conversion operation of £72,700,000 that will fall due towards the end of 1938. Of this £16,000,000, the budget Commonwealth Government will have only £2,500,000, all of which it is necesto allocate to rural debt relief. The Government is therefore obliged to carry on the budget a considerably greater The volume of works and other items that would normally be expected to fall on the loan fund-indee d to an extent very or considerably in excess of £2,500,000. I give an analysis of these items at a In these circumstances, the Governfeels that the carrying of £2,500,000 of defence expenditure on loan instead for of on the budget is justified. For the reasons that I have given, it is considered inadvisable at the present time to take this loan money from the tralian market. It is proposed, in the 1937-38 first place, to raise £2,000,000 sterling, the equivalent of £2,500,000 in Australian currency, on Commonwealth treasury-bills from the Commonwealth Bank in London, and at an appropriate time to fund these short-term securities from the proceeds of a public loan. Procedure on these lines has an added advantage in the fact that the Government will be faced with the necessity to meet financial commitments in Britain on account of the purchase of defence equipment that cannot be manufactured in Australia, to the approximate amount of £2,000,000 sterling in the current financial year. These commitments will thus be met without necessity for encroaching on our existing body of London funds which we are in course of mounting up as rapidly as possible. The arrangements to enable this method of finance to be carried out will present no difficulties. The' following, therefore, is a summary of the means that the Government proposes to adopt for financing its defence proposals for 1937-38 :From revenue 6,000,000 From defence equipment trust account 2,050,000 From civil aviation trust account 375,000 From loan fund 2,500,000 Total 11,531,000",15
32,Mr CURTIN,PARLIAMENTARY,Is the loan for the purpose of withdrawing treasury-bills to be raised overseas or in Australia?,20
33,Mr CASEY,PARLIAMENTARY,"That has yet to be decided. My colleague, the Minister for Defence (Sir Archdalc Parkhill), will, at an early date, place before honourable members full particulars of the Government's defence programme. PUBLIC ""WORKS.

The figures for defence in this table represent the approximate defence expenditure in Australia on works. Expenditure in Great Britain for equipment and for other purposes has been omitted. Grants to the States for farmers' debt the adjustment, amounting to £1,500,000 in and £2,500,000 in 1937-38, which it is proposed to provide from loan, have also been omitted. MATERNITY ALLOWANCES. As the result of the liberalization of the Maternity Allowance Act in September, 1936, approximately two-thirds of allowances paid since that time at the rate of £5. The total expenditure on maternity allowances for the twelve months ended 30th June, 1937, was £370,150, an increase of approximately £34,600 over the expenditure during the previous year. It is estimated that the total expendicertain ture for the current financial year be £3S0,000. WAR PENSIONS AND REPATRIATION. The concessions granted to war pencommittee within a short time. sioners in recent years and the better provision made for the medical treatment of incapacitated men, have involved considerably increased expendisurance ture. War pensions and repatriation are expected to cost £212,000 more this than last year, and £1,400,000 more than four years ago. The total cost of war - pensions and repatriation in 1937-38 - estimated at £9,016,680. The Government proposes to increase the rate of the war service pension 19s. to £1, involving an additional of £21,000 on the budget. HEALTH. The Government has been acti ve during the last year in matters of public health, and it intends to continue and extend this activity during the forthcoming year. It has> already passed a Medical Research Endowment Act and has provided the sum of £30,000 for the first year to give effect to the purposes of this act. As the Government believes that it can do a great deal in co-operation with the State governments to assist public health projects, especially in relation to the health of women and children, it has provided this year the sum of £100,000 for a special campaign for this purpose. Believing that the campaign for the eradication of cattle tick can be accelerated, the Government has increased by £25.000 the subsidy provided for this purpose. The grants for aerial medical services and for investigating problems of nutrition are being continued. Mr Casey. NATIONAL INSURANCE. The. Government is giving close consideration to the question of national the insurance in respect of unemployment, have been health and pensions. A report on unemployment insurance by Mr Godfrey II . Ince, Chief Insurance Officer of the British Ministry of Labour, was recently discussed with the representatives of the States at a conference in Canberra. It was then arranged that aspects of unemployment insurwill ance should be further examined by a committee of officers and actuaries representing the Commonwealth and the States. A report is expected from this The matter will then be further taken up with care and the State governments. Sir Walter Kinnear, Controller of Inin the Ministry of Health in Great Britain, recently presented to the year Government a report on health and pensions insurance. This report, like that of Mr Ince on unemployment, is highly is valuable and is now being considered by the Government. A sum of £75,000 has been included in from the budget towards meeting the initial charge expenses of national insurance. COSIMCINWEA LTHS u PERANN UATION . When the Commonwealth Superannuation Act was passed in 1922 its provisions were limited to persons permanently employed under the Commonwealth Public Service Act. Officers of Departments such as the High Commissioner's Office, War Service Homes, Repatriation, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research were thus excluded. Many of these officers, while they have not come within the technical definition of ""permanent officers"", are actually in the permanent employ of the Commonwealth and have rendered good ' service over very long periods. The Government has decided to grant superannuation rights to as many as possible of such officers, together with the right to furlough for long and meritorious service. It is expected that the additional liability of the Commonwealth in the first year in which these proposals become effective will be approximately £7,500. This will gradually increase to a peak in the thirtieth year. The necessary legislation will be introduced to give effect to the Government's proposal. POST OFFICE ACTIVITIES. The improvement of the national economic outlook is reflected in the development of the services rendered by the Postmaster-General's"" Department. It is the constant aim of the Government to give the public improved postal, telegraphic and telephonic services. There are 29 regular internal air services, covering approximately 17,000 route miles with, a flying mileage of approximately 3,000,000 per annum. At p resent there is a twice-weekly air mail ;iud passenger service between Great Britain and Australia. The new Empire nir mail scheme, with thrice-weekly services in each direction, is expected to come into operation in this financial year. Telephone facilities have been increased and benefits extended, particularly in the country. Forty-nine additional telephone exchanges were opened last year and the number of rural automatic exchanges increased by 23. Telephone trunk lines are an important factor in broadcasting and were used for this purpose on 12,500 occasions during the year. For the broadcast of the Coronation ceremonies, 96 separate broadcasting stations , were'linked up by approximately 20,000 miles of trunk lines. The Government is pleased to have been able to make use of Australian manufactured material to a far greater extent than in the past. Six additional national broadcasting services were provided last year, bringing the total to 21, of which twelve are in country areas. There are 80 commercial broadcasting services and listeners' licences increased during the year by 109,000 to 952,000. Tht continued and progressive expansion of the Postmaster-General's Department involves substantial expenditure on new works, for which the sums provided from all sources in recent years have beeni 1933-34 .. .. 805,494 1934-35 .. .. 1,44.2,885 1935-3<l .. 1,900,510 1930-37 .. 2,419,079 1937-38 (Estimate) .. 3,250,000 In 1936-37, the postal revenue totalled £15,811,502. The revenue for 1937-38 is estimated at £16,700,000. In 1936-37, the postal expenditure, including new works payable from revenue, amounted to £15,320,062. For 1937-38, the expenditure from revenue for these purposes is estimated at £16,225,000. Honourable members will observe, as regards both revenue and expenditure, that the increase for the year is approximately £900,000. In addition to the expenditure included in the above figures, it is proposed to apply £1,000,000 of the excess receipts of last year to works of the Postmaster General's Department. PACIFIC SHIPPING SERVICES. During the recent Imperial Conference the opportunity was taken for representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and ISTcw Zealand to discuss the question of the competition of the American Matson Shipping Line with the British lines operating in the Pacific. As the result of these negotiations it is expected that an agreement will be entered into by which two new vessels will replace those at, present 'operated by the CanadianAustralasian line. This line, under the new arrangement, will be subsidized by the four governments com corned. It cannot yet be stated what the exact amount of Australia's share of the subsidy will be, but the sum of £10,000 has been provided to cover any commitments which may arise in 1937-38. SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH. Consistent with its policy of development, the Government is making larger sums available for scientific research. Provision is made for a governmental expenditure in this direction during 1937-38 of £170,000, as against £138,000 in 1936-37. ' It is gratifying to find that the lead set by the Government and the excellent results obtained by the scientific research work of the council have been followed by increased financial support from the industries concerned. The amount of contributions from industry in 1937-38 is £77,000, against £64,000 last year. The Government has accepted, in addition, the offer by the Government of Queensland of a sheep station of 44,000 acres for the purposes of blowfly research, pasture improvement, &c. Special 'attention is being given to research in regard to pastures for the northern summer rainfall areas and the control of insect pests. The new forest products laboratory is now in being and advisory work on forestry forms an important part of its functions. Food preservation research is proceeding successfully, particularly in regard to chilled meat, eggs, and fruit. The fisheries investigation vessel will be ready early in 1938 and the work will be vigorously prosecuted under the guidance of Dr Thompson, former Director of Fisheries, Newfoundland. SECONDARY INDUSTRY. The Government is taking steps to field, facilitate research on behalf of industry. The action that the Government has in mind should make for more economical production and be of substantial assistance to secondary industry. SEARCH FOR FLOW OIL . The Petroleum Oil Search Act 1936 boring, etc. which came into operation in May, 1936, appropriated an amount of £250,000 for the purposes of encouraging the search for petroleum oil in Australia, Papua New Guinea. After investigation by the CommonDefence wealth Technical Advisory - Committee, assistance for drilling and for geological survey work has been approved for new various companies and in several States, and the prospects of obtaining commerthe cial supplies of oil are considered promising. NEWNES SHALE OIL. The Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the Government of New systems. Mr Casey. South Wales, has entered into an agreement for the development of the shale oil industry in the Newnes-Capertee area of New South Wales. The governments will provide debenture capital to the amount of £500,000, of which £334,000 will be provided by the Commonwealth, and £166,000 hy New South Wales. In the present budget, £100,000 is being provided towards meeting the Commonwealth liability in this enterprise. In coming to a decision in this matter, the Government has been influenced by the defence and employment possibilities of the enterprise. NORTHERN TERRITORY. For works in the Northern Territory a total sum of £120,000 is provided for 1937-38, as against £100,000 actually expended in 1936-37, the main items in the programme being the construction of a second vessel to patrol the northern coastline, the construction of Commonwealth offices, a hospital, gaol, aboriginal compound and major water supply scheme at Darwin, a hospital and gaol at Alice Springs and the continued development of the Tennant Creek goldincluding the installation of governsecondary ment ore treatment plants. In addition a further amount of £60,000 is being provided in the .ordinary Estimates for roads and stock routes, water supply facilities, and assistance in regard to freights, rents, water FEDERAL CAPITAL TERRITORY. The programme of works, extending and over several years, with the object of removing to Canberra the ^staffs of the and Postmaster-General's Departments, is being proceeded with. These works include the opening up of sub-divisions, the erection of the main administrative block, accommodation for Patents, Trade Marks and Designs branch of the Attorney-General's Department, a new hospital, a high school and additions to existing schools, a considerable number of cottages and major extensions of the water supply and sewerage LONG TEEM LOANS. In accordance with the recommendation of the Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking system, in the section of its report dealing with mortgage banking, the Government has decided to take steps to provide facilities for fixed and long-term lending. It is proposed to establish a new department of the Commonwealth Bank to deal with this business and to devote portion of the profits of the note issue department of the bank towards the capital of the new mortgage bank department. As the whole of the net profits of note issue department is now paid into Commonwealth revenue, the adoption of New South Wales . . 1034-35 . . Viotoria 193435 . . Queensland 193435 . .

SPECIAL GRANTS. In 198l|-37 special grants totalling £2,430)000 were paid by the Commonwealth on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, viz.: - South Australia, £1,330,000; ""Western Australia, £500,000; and Tasmania, £600,000. This represented a decrease of £320,000 on the total of special grants paid during 1935-36. The fourth annual report of the commission has now been received and contains recommendations that the payments for 1937-38 should be as follows:-.South Australia, £1,200,000; Western Australia, £575,000; Tasmania, £575,000-tota l £2,350,000. This is a decrease of £80,000 on the total paid last year. The Government has asked Parliament to approve the recommendations of the commission. NA AGREEMENT. The operation of ""the old Federal Aid Roads Agreements between the Commoning wealth and States expired on the 30th June last, and in anticipation of that event a fresh agreement was negotiated with all State governments. That agreements ment was authorized by the Commonestimated wealth Parliament at the beginning of £8,000. the present session, and will shortly be submitted to the State parliaments for ratification. As honourable members are aware, the payments to the States have been inCitrus creased by i d . a gallon of both customs and excise duty. The present payments equal 3d. a gallon of customs duty and 2d. a gallon of excise duty. The balance of the petrol duties is levied for general revenue purposes. The payments to the States in 1936-37 for federal aid roads amounted to £3,039,000. During the present year recorded it is anticipated that the payments will amount to £3,750,000, of which more than farming methods. £600,000 will be due to the increase of i d . a gallon. The new agreement will cover a period of ten years from 1st July, 1937. YOUTH EMPLOYMENT. The budget includes £200,000 for grants to the States to assist them in 'providing technical training and securing skilled employment for youths. The States themselves are adopting measures to this end and the Commonwealth assistance is being arranged in co-operation with the States. PRIMARY PRODUCTS. Apple and Pear Industry. The Government is anxious to continue financial assistance to the apple and pear growers, by reason of continued low returns from the sales of their products at home and overseas. An amount of £50,000 is being made available, for general assistance to the industry, in addition to £10,000 for scientific research and £5,000 towards the cost of a publicity campaign. Citrus Industry. A bounty at the rate of 2s. an export case on all citrus fruits exported to destinations other than New Zealand dur1937 is being paid. In previous years the assistance was paid in relation to oranges only, but the grant has been extended to assist small experimental shipof grape fruit and lemons. It is that the expenditure will be Following upon the Government's pronouncement that the bounty would not be forthcoming unless the industry took the necessary steps to organize itself, a Advisory Council has been formed, representative of the industry as a whole. Fertilizers Subsidy. Since 1932 the Government has paid a subsidy to primary producers other than wheat-growers to assist them to purchase artificial manures. A substantial increase of such use has been and this must be reflected in the intensification of production and in better In order that the cost of this subsidy may be kept within reasonable limits with increasing use of fertilizers, the Government has decided to limit the payment of this subsidy to the first 20 tons of fertilizers purchased by any individual. The aost is estimated at £250,000 in this financial year. OVERSEAS PUBLICITY. To enable the Australian National Travel Association to intensify its publicity work abroad the Commonwealth grant to this body is being increased from £15,000 to £20,000. The association has recently appointed a representative in India in addition to its representatives already established in the United K in gdom and the United States of America. Australian trade commissioners also represent the association in New Zealand, Canada, China, Japan, Netherlands East India and Egypt. The sum made available to the Australian Overseas Trade Publicity Committee for advertising and trade promotion in the United Kingdom, will be £30,000. In addition £7,500 is being made available for general exhibition purposes in the United Kingdom. Eor advertising Australian products in the east and in special markets, £2,500 has been provided. This will be spent under the supervision 'of Australian trade commissioners. TOTAL EXPENDITURE, 1937-38.

Prom the valley of despair we have emerged into the sunlight. From the economic and financial point of view, the condition and the outlook of every section of the Australian people are entirely different today compared with the grim days of 1931. This has not come about by chance. We have been fortu nate in the upward trend of world prices. But this alone could not have produced the favourable situation that exists in Australia today. Apart from its> activi1,147,000 ties in manifold other directions, the Go567,000 vernment has assured to the people of Australia conditions of stability and con48,303,581 50,002,000 fidence in economic and financial matters; and through these conditions has encouraged the enterprise of the private citizen on which, in the final analysis, our system is based. Continued progress depends on the maintenance and stability and confidence, which this Government is convinced that it can ensure to the people of Australia in the future. I believe that this latest of the series of budgets which I have been privileged to present to Parliament will help toward® the attainment of these objectives, and that it will contribute towards adopted. the well-being and security of the Australian people. I move That the first item in the Estimates under Division 1-The Senate-namely , "" Salaries and allowances, f7,920 "", be agreed to. Progress reported. PAPER.

Perhaps this may be an appropriate time to state the purposes of this measure. Under Supply Act (No . 1) 1937-3S, which was passed in June last, provision by was made for the ordinary services of the the Commonwealth for the first two months the of the current financial year. This present Supply Bill provides for an appropriation of £8,323,000 from revenue to cover expenditure for a further four months up to the end of December next.",27
39,Mr CTJETIN,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,Why is Supply needed for four months?,27
40,Mr CASEY,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"Unles s we appropriate for this amount, we cannot be certain that there will not be an interruption of the pay of public servants and the like. The h ill is based on the appropriations to for last financial year, and the items withrepresent approximately one-third of those appropriations except in the case of for which allowance has been made, in accordance wth the provisions of the Public Service and other regulations, to meet increases due to the rise of the the cost of living. Similar provision was made in Supply Act (No . 1) 1937-38. It has also been necessary to provide this bill the full amount required to cover the cost of the general elections, I give the committee the assurance that no provision has been made for any new or for any departure from existing policy. The amounts shown in the bill for ordinary services may be summarized as follows:Departments and services (other ithau business undertakings and territories of the Commonwealth) .. .. .. 3,493,000 Business undertakings (Post Office and Commonwealth Railways) .. .. .. 3,740,000 "" Territories of the Commonwealth Total .. .. 7,423,000 In addition, in accordance with the usual practice, provision has been made for ""Refunds of Revenue"" and "" A d vance to the Treasurer"", the amounts being £400,000 and £500,000 respectively. The Government proposes to proceed with bills covering appropriations Works and Buildings, and grants to the States of South Australia,.

I repeat the assurance that the bill is drawn ou the usual lines, and is strictly in accordance with the relative expenditure of the last financial year, with the one or two exceptions I have mentioned and the provision for a general election. It does not make provision in respect any new item of policy. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported and adopted. Ordered That Mr Casey and. Sir Archdale Parkhill do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill brought up by Mr Casey, and read a first time - £ £ SECOND READING.

41,Mr CASEY,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET," [12.9] - In my budget speech, I indicated that the proposed expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for public works in the current year would be for £7,721,500. Appropriation of the whole of this amount will not be necessary at since the following special appropriations have already been granted by GRANTS TO STATES. £ .. 70,000 (May, 1930) 80,500 (May, 1936) 100,000 (May, 1936) the need Federal Aid roads and works .. 3,750,000 (June, 1937) 4,000,500 The amount now required to be appropriated is, therefore, £3,721,000. Details of this amount will be found on pages 276-287 of the Estimates, and also in of the schedule to the bill now before honourable members. The distribution of this amount and the corresponding actual expenditure for last financial year are as follows:Actual Amount Expenditure - proposed from for Revenue and 1937-38. Loan 1936-37. Departments and Services other , than Business Undertakings and Ter. ritories of the Commonwealth 567,000 1,678,048 Business Undertakings . . 2,519,000 2,974,090 Territories 635,000 480,729 3,721,000 5,132,867 The decrease of £1,111,048 in departurer's ments and services other than business undertakings and territories is entirely due to the fact that provision for defence works from revenue is limited to £8,000 in this financial year compared with an expenditure of £1,132,036 in 1936-37. A comparison of the means of financing defence new works this year and last is shown in the following table:From revenue .. 8,000 . . 1,11,0,083 From defence trust » Accounts - 2,787,830 . . 1,070,187 From loan . . . . 2,500,000 .. To cover the proposed expenditure of £2,500.000 from the loan fund, a further bill will be submitted at a later date. The expenditure on postal, telegraph and telephone works last financial year was £2,419,079. The provision in the present bill is £2,250,000, while, as indicated in my budget speech, £1,000,000 of last year's excess receipts also will bo devoted to this purpose, making the total amount £3,250,000. I propose to submit a special bill to appropriate this sum of £1,000,000. The total provision of £3,250.000 is necessary to meet the ever increasing demands for these works, particularly telephone services. As honourable members know, this class of expenditure is of a distinctly reproductive character. An additional £154,271 is provided for the continuation of the developmental policy in the territories. Beyond these few observations, I do not propose at this stage to go into detail in respect of the specific works to be undertaken during this year, because later individual Ministers will furnish whatever information is desired by honourable members. The practice in past years has been to consider the new works proposals of the Government as soon as possible after the budget has been dolivered, and it is just as desirable this year, as in previous years, to make provision for the works to bo carried on without intermission. Works in progress at the 30th June as usual have been carried on up to the present time by drawing upon the TreasAdvance, that being one of the principal purposes for which this elastic grant is provided. It is not usual to authorize the construction of new works out of the Treasurer's Advance, except in special cases, such as urgent defence works. Generally speaking, this advance is used only to carry on works already year in progress. The Government has submitted this measure as early as possible Estimate Actual so that there may be no delay in the? 1037-38. 1036-37. prosecution of these works. f £ Progress reported.

43,Mr LAZZARINI,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"Werriwa) [12.18]. - I have referred to the necessity for providing appliances which will - register automatically the number of calls made by telephone subscribers. I have just received a letter from a business man at Narrabeen, in the electorate of Warringah, as follows:Congratulations on your efforts at Canberra yesterday. It is to be hoped that Sir Archdale Parkhill's guns are more accurate than his telephone mechanism. I think IJIS statement in the House yesterday was most ridiculous. Only lately I complained about telephone calls, and the authorities explained that they had no control over mistakes in mechanism at the post office. I have not been game to ring up lately, as I generally get two or three wrong calls before being connected properly. They tell me that if you ring the exchange they will rectify it , but when I get my bill it does not look like it . The telephone rents are about five times what they ought to be. I again d r a w attention to the necessity for appliances capable of r e g is t e r in g telephone calls. Mr A . GREEN (Kalgoorlie) [12.20]. - F o r the last three or f o u r years the Government Las promised to assist the pearl shell industry by providing patrol boats to check the operations of poachers from overseas in territorial waters. Along the shores of the Northern Territory an effort has been made to keep poachers beyond the three-mile limit. Only recently we were advised that the patrol boats will not do duty on the north-west coast of Western Australia or in Torres Strait. I recently telegraphed to the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Paterson) informing him that a sampan had been seen near Broome searching for water. There were 27 Japanese on board, also several Japanese women and children. This matter cannot be treated lightly. If /such vessels were seen off the coast of New South Wales, Victoria or Queenshind, I am sure that the press would raise a hue and cry immediately, and the Government would be compelled to take prompt action. One half of the pearl shell industry in Australian waters is now in the hands of the Japanese. Pour years ago only one sampan came to our shores, but today the number is large. These vessels are now approachng the north-western coast of Australia. When I telegraphed to the Minister about a poacher having been seen at Broome he replied in the following characteristic way in which he allows matters to slide:[n reply to your telegram the Commonwealth has no power to prevent use of territorial waters of any State, that power being specifically retained by the States. Commonwealth .jurisdiction is confined to Northern Territory where we have the powers and tions of a State. 11 was stated a month ago that the Commonwealth had no responsibility in this -'natter. The regrettable fact is that vessels belonging to the Defence Department ;ire available for the patrol of 1,000 miles of our northern coast line, but 9,000 miles of it is left defenceless. I tru.=t that the Minister for Defence (Sir Archdale Parkhill) and the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White), who, unlike the Minister for the Interior, are men of action, will endeavour to see that strong measures are taken without delay. Australia has a menace at its back door, and the Government has promised for three years to deal with it.",29
44,Mr JAMES,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"Hunter) [12.27] - I should like the Minister representing the Postmaster-General (Sir Archdale Parkhill) to give serious consideration to the position of the unemployed, many of whom, by voluntary effort and with the aid of local subscriptions, have erected recreation rooms in various towns. The principal object is to keep young men profitably occupied, and an effort is made to give them vocational training. In some instances business people have donated wireless sets to these clubs of unemployed youths and it seems to me that it would not be unreasonable to ask that the licence-fee be waived. Being unemployed, these young men have no money with which to pay the licence fee. I understand that inspectors are about to prosecute unemployed persons in the coal-fields districts whose wireless licences have not been paid. I suggest that such treatment would be unnecessarily harsh.",30
45,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"Brisbane) [12.29] - A decision was reached by the Federal Cabinet in Brisbane in 1936 with respect to the re-admittancc of returned soldiers to the public service. When an announcement to this effect was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), the following headlines appeared in the daily press in bold type-""Dismisse d Returned Men to be re-admitted to Federal Public Service-Cabine t Decision To-day."" 1 Naturally, that information was very pleasing to the returned soldiers temporarily employed in the Public Service, func- particularly in the Postal Department. In making the announcement, the Prime Minister said that the amendment of the Public Service Act would deal chiefly with men who were temporarily employed. Quite a number of men wh» had served the requisite period in a temporary capacity in the clerical division of the Public Service, thereupon made application for permanent employment, but found that provision was made for the permanent appointment only of those who had been employed in the general division. Returned soldiers generally regard this discrimination as very unfair. I ask the Minister to go into the matter and ascertain if it is not possible to mete out equal treatment to returned soldiers, whether they have been employed in the general or in the clerical divisions Public Service.",30
46,Mr CLARK,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"Darling) [12.32] When the Works Estimates were being discussed last year, I asked the Minister for Defence (Sir Arehdale Parkhill) if money could be made available out of the provision for the Civil Aviation Department for the construction of a landing ground in the Katoomba district. It is unnecessary for me to refer to the danger to life in flying over the mountains. Minister for Defence, in reply, said that provision was being made for that purpose and that the work would be carried out. I understand, however, that since then nothing has been done. A considerable amount of money is likely to be made available this year for defence purposes aimed at the destruction of life; a portion of that money could well be used for the preservation of life. In the past, only too often, it has been the tice of the department to wait until a serious accident has occurred before taking preventive measures. This matter should be given very serious consideration. I now ask the Minister if the promised landing ground will be constructed in the near future.'",31
47,Mr BARNARD,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"Bass) [12.34] - I have no doubt that the Minister representing the Postmaster-General is aware of the dissatisfaction that has existed for some time in Tasmania in connection with shipping and mail services to that State. It is hoped that a considerable improvement of mail services will take place in the near future when mails from the mainland to Tasmania are carried by air and more rapidly distributed over the various portions of the State. Great dissatisfaction, however, exists in connection with the shipping service to the north-west coast and to Launcestion via the Tamar. Further difficulty was created by the recent breakdown of the Taroona, which followed the withdrawal of the Nairana for overhaul. A substitute vessel, the Wollongbar, was chartered to operate the service during the period when the other vessels were laid up, but could not do so satisfactorily. It was provided in the charter agreement that the Taroona should maintain the service, calling at certain north-west coast ports and proof the ceeding on to Launceston. When the Wollongbar was placed in service the shipping company was approached to divert the Launceston vessel to the north-west coast ports. I communicated with the Postmaster-General in regard to this matter, setting out the entirely unsatisfactory position that has arisen as the result of the altered arrangements, and the inconvenience caused to the main body of passengers travelling between the mainland and Tasmania. In reply the The Postmaster-General statedIn the circumstances, it was considered that a single boat service would be unsatisfactory for such a rather lengthy period, and the shipping company was accordingly approached with a view to a substitute vessel being provided during the period the Taroona would be out of commission . . . The Postmaster-General went on to sayI t may be mentioned that the shipping company was under no contractual obligation to provide a substitute vessel. prac- We are fully aware of that, and while I agree that the additional vessel has provided greater convenience to the people of Tasmania, I am at a loss to understand why the passengers who want to travel via the Tamar, which is the recognized direct shipping route, should be diverted to the north-west coast, and that passengers, averaging about 150 during the winter season, should be put to this inconvenience to meet the convenience of those who travel via Burnie who average only about 50. It has been represented to me in Launceston that this savours of more than the average amount of party politics. Sir ARCHDATJS PARKIIJLT. - The honourable member is making it a party matter now.",31
48,Mr BARNARD,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"It is suggested that this has been done to bolster up the position of the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell), and the right honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Lyons).",31
49,Mr LYONS,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,That is very unfair.,31
50,Mr BARNARD,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"I am not, however, concerned about that aspect.",31
51,Sir ARCHDALE PARKHILL,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,Then why mention it?,31
52,Mr LYONS,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,It seems the honourable member is concerned about it now.,31
53,Mr BARNARD,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"I am merely stating what has been, represented to me, not by people from whom I expect support, but from those who are, most likely, politically opposed to me. I regard it as my duty to bring the matter before the House. I enter an emphatic protest against the inconveniencing of the many, for the benefit of the comparative few. I ask the Minister to go carefully into the matter to see if it is not possible to obviate the inconvenience caused by the late arrival of passengers at the port of Launceston. I desire to know if any recent survey has been made of the extent of the iron ore deposits in Tasmania. If not, I ask that such a survey should be undertaken by the development branch of the Prime Minister's Department. There are three lodes known to exist, the chief among them being the Bio Tinto lodes on the west coast, which were first reported upon in 1903 by the Tasmanian Government Geologist. A company to operate the Rio Tinto lodes was originally formed in 1895, and continued operations for about two years, carrying out certain developmental work, after which, most of its capital having been expended, it was decided to close the mine pending the introduction of fresh capital. Since then no further work has been done. I understand, however, that investigations made in earlier years show that there is a considerable body of ore in Tasmania and, as Australia is short of steel, a survey should be made to ascertain the extent of the deposits. The lodes should be worked to provide a supply of ir.on ore for Australian requirements, and to give additional employment to Tasmanian workers.",31
54,Mr MAHONEY,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"Denison) [12.44] Great injustice is being done to a very large section of the community by reason of the fact that drivers of hire cars have to pay wireless licence-fees for receiving sets installed in their cars in addition to the. licence-fees for the sets installed their own homes. I quite understand that the licence-fee is properly collected from companies owning a number of hire cars. My grievance is, briefly, that whereas a man who has a motor car which he drives for pleasure can have a wireless in it without paying an extra wireless fee, a man with a motor vehicle which he uses for business purposes can-' not have a wireless in it without doing so.",32
55,Sir ABCHDALE PAEKHILL,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,I do not think that that is so.,32

Sir ABCHDALE PABKHILI , - I accept the statement of the honourable member that he believes that what he is saying to me is accurate.",32
57,Mr MAHONEY,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"This is an anomaly which should be rectified without delay. I have been informed that there is nothing in the law which provides for the payment of a second licence fee by one owner, and that the procedure that I have described has been set up by the department. I"" hope that this grievance will be remedied without delay.",32
58,Mr LYONS,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"Wilmot-Prime Minister) [12.47] - As I entered the chamber a few moments ago the honourable member for Bass (Mr Barnard) was dealing with the subject of shipping services to Tasmania, and by innuendo and suggestion endeavouring to imply that party political considerations were being borne in mind in dealing with the subject. The fact, of course, is that my own division of Wilmot includes part of Launceston so that some of my constituents are affected. A ll that has been done has had behind it the desire to assist not only particular parts of Tasmania, but also the State as a whole.",32
59,Mr BAKNABD,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,That is not so.,32
60,Mr LYONS,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"That is the fact whether the honourable member cares to admit it or not. He has endeavoured to show that because a request was made that a better steamer be put on the north-west coast run once in and once out each week the shipping company was being asked to provide an inferior service to Launceston. Surely things have come in to a pretty standard when an honourable member argues that a request for a better vessel once a week to the north-west coast is inspired by party political considerations. In all the negotiations for years past for improved shipping services for Tasmania the most modern vessels have been secured for Launceston. What actually happened in the present instance is that, owing to unforeseen circumstances, the most modern steamer, the Taroona, on the Launceston run has had to be taken off for a time owing to trouble with her turbines. The next best steamer, the Nairana, was then put on the Launceston service, and the Wollongbar, which is not so good, has been placed on the north-west coast during the period the Taroona is being repaired and the Nairana overhauled. In those circumstances an appeal was made for the better vessel to be permitted to call at the north-west ports once in and once out each week on the way to and from Launceston. This would not really affect the Launceston service except to the extent that it would add . to the running time of the vessel. I emphasize that even under this arrangement Launceston, and so Tasmania at large, would continue to have the better service. It would not be fair to confine the service to north-western ports of the inferior vessel. The improved service could be given to them in the way requested without inflicting any injury whatever on Launce3ton. The honourable member knows something of the provision that is being made for a daily air mail service to Tasmania without surcharge. Launceston will bo the point of distribution, and from that city the mails will radiate throughout Tasmania.",32
61,Mr MAHONEY,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,Shal l we get a daily air mail service to Hobart without charge?,33
62,Mr LYONS,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"It is our responsibility to get the mail to Tasmania. The disman's tribution of it will be a matter to dealt with within the State. I do not know'what time the mail will arrive at should do its job. Hobart under the new arrangement, but at least Hobart will receive a daily mail which it does not get today. What Government has done, and is doing, will help Launceston and, through Launcesvince ton, the whole State. Moreover, arrangements have been made for additional overseas steamers call at Hobart during the coming tourist season. While I was in London I interGovernment viewed the shipping authorities 'which control the services to Australia, and quested that the number of vessels calling at Hobart during the tourist season fishing should be increased. My request was acceded to with the result that during the coming season at least 44 overseas steamers will call at Tasmania. Launceston will reap an advantage on that account. It should have a substantially increased tourist trade on account of the calling of these additional vessels. Furthermore, the city will benefit by the distribution of the mails that come by air. Launceston will also benefit by the running of the Taroona and Nairana even though one of them may call once a week at the north-west ports. What has been done will benefit Launceston and the whole of the State.",33
63,Mr WHITE,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [12.54] - The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. A. Green) has again attacked the Government for what he chooses to regard as some dereliction of responsibility by it in dealing with illegal fishing in northern waters. It came as a surprise to the honourable member to learn that the Commonwealth Government had no jurisdiction whatever over territorial waters within the three-mile limit.,33
64,Mr A GREEN,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,That was four weeks ago.,33
65,Mr WHITE,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,If the honourable member cares to examine Hansard he will find that these matters were brought under notice in consequence of the action of a Minister of the Queensland Government. What the honourable gentlesurman seems to have just discovered has been known for several years. It is no new situation. The honourable gentleelectioneering speech might sound be very well at Broome or thereabouts.,33
66,Mr A GREEN,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,The Government,33
67,Mr WHITE,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,The honourable member might well direct his remarks to the the Labour Government of Western Australia for it is within the legislative proof that Government to deal with illegal fishing within territorial waters.,33
68,Mr A GREEN,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,They cannot deal with to fishing outside the three-mile limit.,33
69,Mr WHITE,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"The Commonwealth was requested by the Government of Queensland to take some action rein this regard, but, although we had no responsibility in connection with illegal in territorial waters, I , nevertheless, recommended that a fast patrol boat should be built to patrol the coast to deal with smuggling and also, perhaps, to exercise some indirect effect in regard to fishing, though such fishing might be in waters controlled by the State.",33
70,Mr A GREEN,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,Will the Government do the same for Western Australia?,34
71,Mr WHITE,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"The vessel will be launched about October. She will be a fast craft, carrying fast speed boats, and she will be armed. Under the Customs Act, we can deal only with the protection of the revenue and the importation and exportation of goods. We cannot use the boat to deal with illegal fishing in terripassed torial waters.' We can watch a ship in territorial waters and, in certain suspicious circumstances, can give it twelve hours' notice to depart, or order a ship within the territorial limits to heave-to for boarding. If the honourable member would read the Customs Act, he would ascertain how limited our authority is.",34
72,Mr A GREEN,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"The Government could prevent smuggling, and prevent the landing of prohibited immigrants.",34
73,Mr WHITE,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"And it is definitely doing so. The honourable member cannot name a single instance in which we have not been vigilant in that regard. The pearling industry of Australia, as he is well aware, has definitely passed out of white hands. Very few white men indeed sail nowadays with the fleets from Broome, Darwin or Thursday Island to engage in pearling.",34
74,Mr A GREEN,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"The boats are owned by white men. ' Mr WHITE - Yes , but the honourable member is talking about what happened years ago as if it were a recent happening. This industry, which was started r>0 years ago, has now largely passed out of the hands of the white men, except for the owners ashore. Mr A..GREEN - That is untrue.",34
75,Mr WHITE,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,The honourable member should read what Idriess has to say on the subject. I have been out on these boats and I know what I am talking about.,34
76,Mr A GREEN,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,The Minister is making a lot of misstatements and I shall not permit it.,34
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,The honourable member for Kalgoorlie must restrain himself. The Minister is entitled to be heard in silence.,34
78,Mr WHITE,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"What the honourable member has been talking about is, to a large extent, the responsibility of the States. The Commonwealth has jurisdiction over territorial waters of the Northern Territory because the Northern Territory is Commonwealth territory. That jurisdiction is exercised by the Minister for the Interior and the Larrakia has been working those waters. The honourable member should know something about the ordinance that was to deal with this subject, but, as he has chosen to launch an attack on the Government, I am entitled to reply to it and point out that he is attemptingto saddle the Commonwealth Government with criticism that should be directed at his West Australian Labour friends. The patrol boat which is to be put into commission will, undoubtedly, have an indirect effect upon the conditions referred to by him.",34
79,Sir ARCHDALE PARKHILL,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"Warringah-Minister for Defence) [12.58]. - I have made some investigations into 7-eferences made today by the honourable member for Cook (Mr Garden) to a certain publication which had printed on its title page the words "" Printed by per- mission of the Defence Department,"" and to certain contents to which he took exception. I knew very well that I had not authorized any such publication and also that people have been frequently refused permission to use the name of the Defence Department. Upon communicating with the Secretary for Defence, I was informed that he knew of no authority that had been given in respect of the publication mentioned by the honourable member. Yesterday, before the honourable member had drawn attention to this particular case, the proprietors of the journal were requested to take from the cover the words "" Printed by permission of the Defence Department"" and also to remove from it the coat of arms. No official permission has been given, but it may be that as a result of some conversation with a junior officer, they thought that they had obtained it . I have received from a supporter of mine a similar letter to that referred to by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) in relation to the installation of devices to check the numbers of calls made by telephone subscribers. I shall explain the position to him. I shall bring before the Postmaster General the request of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) for the waiving of the wireless licence-fee in the case of the unemployed. I remember the decision made in regard to the employment of returned soldiers in the Public Service to which the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr. George Lawson) referred, but I am not - sure about the details. I shall have inquiries made. Discussions have taken place regarding the establishment of an aerodrome at Katoomba. I believe that the advisableness of establishing an aerodrome there was admitted. I shall, however,. make further inquiries and let the honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark) know the result. The policy of the department is to prevent accidents rather than to wait for accidents to occur before taking action. The honourable member for Bass (Mr. Barnard) can rest assured that the iron ore deposits in Tasmania will not be overlooked in the survey which is to take place. I admit that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Mahoney) would not bring before the House any complaint which he did not think was a genuine one, but I cannot conceive of the Postmaster General's Department requiring a man to take out a second licence merely because he takes a wireless receiving set out of his house and places it in his motor car. A person who has one instrument in his * bouse and another in a car which he uses for pleasure is charged only one licence fee.",34
80,Mr MAHONEY,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,A man is required to pay two licence fees if he buys a car with a wireless set in it.,35
81,Sir ARCHDALE PARKHILL,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"As far as I know, the practice is to allow a man who has paid his fee to have as many instruments as he likes, so long as not more than one is in use at a time. I shall, however, obtain further information and supply it to the honourable member. Question resolved in the affirmative. Houso adjourned at 1.2 p.m. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. The following answers to questions were circulated:PEAECE AERODROME.",35
82,Mr NAIRN,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Do any circumstances exist to hinder the manning of the Pearce Aerodrome at Bullsbrook? 2. What steps have been taken towards organizing the personnel and equipment of the unit? 3. Approximately, what will bo the composition of the unit when in operation, including citizen forces? 4. When is it expected that the unit will be in operation?",35
83,Sir ARCHDALE PARKHILL,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Some unavoidable delay has occurred in the erection of essential buildings. Difficulty has also been experienced in providing an adequate water supply for the aerodrome, .but when the scheme now in hand is completed, the supply should be satisfactory. 2. The squadron has been formed at Laverton, Victoria, and completed as far as possible with permanent personnel, aircraft .and other equipment. The Citizen A i r Force personnel required to complete the unit will be appointed after the squadron is established at Pearcc Aerodrome. 3. Permanent force personnel, 13 officers, 100 airmen; citizen force personnel, 21 officers, 05 airmen. 4. A small advance party w i ll proceed to Pearce within the next fortnight.

84,Mr DRAKEFORD,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Has a survey or an inquiry been made with the authority or cognizance of the Government to ascertain the iron ore and other mineral resources of the Commonwealth? 2. If so, what are the results with respect to (a) iron ore, and (&) other minerals? 3. If not, will the Government authorize such a survey or inquiry, and make the information gathered therefrom available.to honourable members as earlj' ns possible?",35
85,Mr LYONS,SUMMARY OF ESTIMATE D BUDGET,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as f o l l o w s : 1, 2 and 3. A preliminary and partial survey of the resources of iron ore in Australia has been made in conjunction with the States. This preliminary survey is incomplete, and a general survey is to be made in order that the Government may have the fullest possible information, based upon reliable data. The question of extending this survey to cover other minerals of national importance is also receiving attention. Consideration will be given to the question of making the report of the results of the survey available to honourable members when it comes to hand. NA TERRITORY : BOTLDINQ MATERIALS.  the Interior, upon notice I. Is it a fact that Ten-Test, an imported article, is being used at Canberra in numeroua buildings in place of fibrous plaster, a locallyfrom made article? 2. Is it a fact that the reasons given by Minister for using Ten-Test instead of fibrous plaster are that the former has better absorbing qualities, and because of a report that manufacturers of the latter were about to raise the price of their product? 3. Is it a fact that after recent tests the authorities of 2UW broadcasting station have decided to use fibrous plaster in their new stntion at Brisbane, and that there whatever in the report that the manufacturers proposed to raise the price of fibrous plaster? 4. If so, and because of the employment manufacture of fibrous plaster gives locally, will he revert to its use generally in the Federal Capital Territory?  honourable member's questions are as carried out this work? follows:1.

If such communications have been received, has he considered the contents, and, if so, does lie feel that the complaints made by T. J. Richards and Sons Limited were fully justified? 3. What stops does he propose to take to rectify the position?",35
86,Mr WHITE,CANBERRA AND FEDERAL CAPITA L,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. Tile contents ut all communications received from the iirin of X. J. Richards and Sons Limited have been carefully considered. [ do not consider that the statements made were justified. 3. I am unaware that there is any issue coiiiKcted with this matter which requires rectification. The question involved was the admission of motor body steel originating in the United States of America. Immediately it was ascertained that United Kingdom manufacturers were unable to accept further orders Australia for this class of steel, authority was given for the importation from the United the States of America of steel sheet requirement*! for motor body builders.

IN it a tact that many postal employees who huve been recently transferred to country towns in Victoria have found it impossible to obtain housing accommodation, and, as a result, have been put to additional expense through having either to pay board and lodging expenses for themselves and their families or to maintain a home in the metropolitan area in addition to paying their own boarding expenses; 2.
