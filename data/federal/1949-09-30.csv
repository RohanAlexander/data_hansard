0,NA,Unknown,"House of Representatives. Friday, SO September, 1949.",10
1,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr J. J. Clark) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. PETROL.",10
2,Mr DUTHIE,Unknown,"If petrol rationing has to be reintroduced in this country as it has been in New Zealand, to ensure adequate supplies for primary producers, transport undertakings and other essential users, can the Prime Minister indicate whether the rationing scale will he the same as that existing at the date of the High Court's decision on this matter?",10
3,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I have not yet had an opportunity to discuss this matter with the Minister for Shipping and Fuel, or with the Director-General of Rationing, Mr Gumming, who, incidentally, hopes to come to Canberra today for consultations, but I can assure the honourable member that, when rationing is reintroduced, every endeavour will be made to ensure that the needs of essential consumers such as primary producers and the transport industry shall be met so far as possible. The rationing scale will bave to be considered in relation to the supply of petrol that is available. I am unable to give the honourable member a complete answer on that point at the moment, but I hope to be able to do so within the next four or five days, after I have had an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Minister and the Director-General. NA GRAMOPHONE RECORDS.",10
4,Mr HARRISON,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I ask .the Attorney-General whether the authorities have yet had an opportunity to examine the album of gramophone records that was brought to this country from Czechoslovakia by the general president of the Australian Communist party, Mr Dixon, and was seized by Australian customs oflicers. If so, has it been ascertained whether the recordings are actually of Czechoslovakian cultural music as was claimed, or of Communist propaganda to be used in Australia ? In the latter event, what action is to be taken against Mr. Bison?",10
5,Dr EVATT,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I have no knowledge of the matter to which the honourable member has referred. I shall ascertain from the security service whether there is any substance in what the honourable member has said and, if practicable, and feasible, I shall inform the honourable member of the result later. EDUCATION . COMMONWEALTH SCHOLARSHIP SCHEME.",10
6,Mr BEAZLEY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction stated recently that the Commonwealth was establishing 3,000 scholarships at universities and other institutions throughout Australia. I ask the honourable gentleman whether in faculties such as engineering, in which students have to gain practical experience in mines and factories, the scholarship allowance will be paid to them even if they are in receipt of wages? ""Will the means test be applied to students who are in receipt of wages when engaged in this practical work ?",10
7,Mr DEDMAN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I am aware, of course, that in certain faculties, students have to gain practical experience with outside organisations. They may even have to be employed by private firms in industry generally. I am not aware of the conditions that apply to the payment of allowances to such individuals at such times, but I assume that that difficulty has been met under the present scheme. There have been no complaints about it whatsoever. Since it has been met under the existing scheme, and as the proposed new scheme is a liberalization of the existing one, I am sure that no difficulty will arise in this connection. NATIONALIZATION .",10
8,Mr ANTHONY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I refer to an address made by the Prime Minister at the triennial conference of the Australian Labour party twelve months ago which was reported in the Labour Call, a Melbourne Labour newspaper, as "" Chifley's inspiring address"". In that address the right honourable gentleman made certain remarks which I now ask him to clarify as we are on the eve of a general election.",10
9,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,Order ! That matter haa been thoroughly canvassed in this House. The honourable member may not have been present yesterday - when two or three questions were asked on the same matter.,10
10,Mr ANTHONY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,This is an entirely different matter.,11
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Then the honourable member may ask his question. "" Mr ANTHONY - The Prime Minister is reported by the Labour Call to have said I have always said that if there is a great public utility, essential to the needs of the public, that is badly managed or handled, it should be nationalized. . . . We have been making a selection of really essential things, so that we shall not get mixed up with things that do not matter. Will the Prime Minister state what industries his Government has been selecting for nationalization? Will he announce them so that the public may know before the elections what industries the Government proposes to nationalize?",11
12,Mr CHIFLEY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I have made my position and that of the Australian Labour party quite clear on a number of occasions in reply to questions at public meetings and in addresses to conferences of the Australian Labour party. For the benefit of the honourable member, in rase he may have some misunderstanding of the position, I shall repeat what I have so often said on this matter.",11
13,Mr ANTHONY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,I have no misunderstanding about it .,11
14,Mr CHIFLEY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"What the Australian Labour party has said, and what I have said very often on behalf of the party, is that if some great public utility is not serving the best interests of the community and is not being properly managed in the interests of the people, or is exploiting the public, it should b?. the subject of nationalization, or, as the honourable member calls it , of socialization. I remember one notable occasion when the conservative Premier of South  with regard to the Adelaide electricity supply.",11
15,Mr MCEWEN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,The Labour party carried a number of resolutions about the liquor trade.,11
16,Mr CHIFLEY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I do not regard liquor as an essential commodity. Mr . Playford took the view that the electricity undertaking in Adelaide should be owned and operated by the people. A similar view was taken by the Government of Victoria, in relation to the electricity undertaking in that State. Nobody would suggest that the Victorian electricity supply, which was nationalized by a conservative government, is not being operated by the State Electricity Commission in the best interests of the community. So that the honourable member will have no misconceptions about this matter, let me repeat what I have said. If , in the opinion of the Australian Labour party, some great public utility is not being properly managed in the best interests of the people, or is exploiting the people, that utilit y should be placed under public ownership.",11
17,Mr ANTHONY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"The Prime Minister omitted, I am sure by inadvertence, to answer the latter part of my question. I now ask him if he will inform the House of the industries he had in mind when he told the triennia] conference of the Australian Labour party that the Government had made a selection of certain industries that it desired to nationalize.",11
18,Mr CHIFLEY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"The Government has never made out a list of industries that might be. or should he', nationalized in the interests of the community. Any decision of that kind can only be made in respect of particular industries in the light of circumstances existing at the time. The considerations that, would be involved would be, first, whether an industry was failin g to give full and proper service in the public interest; and, secondly, whether it was exploiting the public. Those questions can be determined ouly in the light of existing circumstances. I should add that the Commonwealth's power to nationalize, or socialize, any industry is strictly limited. For instance, honourable members will have some knowledge of a recent case in which the High Court ruled that the Commonwealth could not nationalize a certain industry over which the Constitution specifically gives control to the Australian Commonwealth; and that judgment was upheld by the Privy Council. That also happened with relation to the proposal to nationalize the airlines. Each case will be met and judged on the basis of serving the best interests of the people. MAJOR-GENERAL C. E. M. LLOYD.",11
19,Mr LANG,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I desire to address a question to the Minister for External Affairs, who is Australia's representative on the United Nations. Can the right honourable gentleman inform the House how many officials of the United Nations are located in Australia? Has he any information about the terms of appointment of Major-General C. E. M. Lloyd, a representative of the International Refugee Organization in Australia? Is Major-General Lloyd paid at the rate of 7,500 dollars a year? Does that mean that the amount of his salary, paid in Australia, has been increased by 44 per cent, due to the devaluation of the currency, bringing his remuneration to approximately £3,500 a year? Is he exempt from the payment of all taxes, including tariff and excise duties? Has he diplomatic immunity as an officer of the United Nations? Has Major-General Lloyd employed his wife as his secretary ? If he has done so, what is her salary and i« it also exempt from taxation? Is it the policy of the United Nations to encourage its officials to place their wives on the pay-roll ? Has the United Nations any organization to supervise the work of its officials who now appear to be scattered all over the world?",12
20,Dr EVATT,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"The United Nations has officials in all parts of the world, but very few of them are in this country. I presume that their salary is paid on the basis of dollar currency. Major-General Lloyd is an official not of the United Nations but of a separate body called the International Refugee Organization. The membership of the International Refugee Organization is much smaller than that of the United Nations. Australia is a member of the International Refugee Organization. Major-General Lloyd is not a member of the staff of the United Nations, and the terms and conditions of his employment would be determined by che International Refugee Organization. INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. SOVIET-YUGOSLAV TENSION.",12
21,Mr HOLT,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Can the Minister for External Affairs confirm, from advices officially received, the report of a diplomatic break between Soviet Russia and Yugoslavia?. Has the right honourable gentleman anything to add to the statement which appears in this morning's press? Is there any evidence of further hostile action by Soviet Russia against Yugoslavia in the near future? In accordance with the practice of the United Nations, of which the Soviet is a member, would Russia normally have conveyed to that organization advice of a breach of diplomatic relations, as has occurred in this instance? If so, and if this practice has not been adopted, does Australia propose to raise the matter at the United Nations? What additional information has the Minister to give to the House about the matter generally?",12
22,Dr EVATT,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I do not understand that tliere has been a rupture of diplomatic relations between Soviet Russia and Yugoslavia. I think that the relationship between the two countries is a very tense one. Russia has denounced the treaty of alliance and friendship with Yugoslavia, but a breach of diplomatic relations is not necessarily involved in that. The United Nations has no special authority in such a case. If a stage of friction is reached that is likely to lead to war, the United Nations would probably take cognizance of the matter. Both countries are represented at the present session of the United Nations. As a rule, the members of what is called the eastern bloc in the General Assembly of the United Nations vote together. Including Russia, there are six members of the eastern bloc. But, in important votes which have taken place in the General Assembly during the last ten days, the number of six has been reduced to five, again showing that Yugoslavia is declaring or is acting upon its independence of the eastern bloc. That is the situation, and I have no further information to give to the honourable member. If news of any developments is received, I shall endeavour to keep the honourable gentleman fully informed. LEGAL SERVICE BUREAU.",12
23,Mr HAYLEN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I direct a question to the Attorney-General regarding the announcement that 600,000 pensioners and persons entitled to claim social services benefits are to be provided vvith free legal advice by the Legal Service Bureau established by the Attorney-General's Department for the benefit of ex-servicemen. Is the bureau to continue its service to ex-servicemen? Since it is proposed to extend its operations to include the giving of advice to civilians, will the bureau be decentralized by the setting up of country branches, so that this very important organization, which works for the underprivileged, may be more readily accessible to the people ?",12
24,Dr EVATT,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"The honourable member for Parkes has taken a very keen interest in the Legal Service Bureau, as have some other honourable members. It was referred to only the other day by the honourable member for Cook. The legal Service Bureau, which was set up to help ex-servicemen and their dependants, has a statutory basis, and its work is not only being continued, but is also being extended. It is difficult to provide a complete service, but there are branches all through the States, and a legal officer in the Northern Territory and another in the Australian Capital Territory acts for ex-servicemen. Under the new arrangement, officers in the bureau are authorized to deal with legal questions arising out of certain social services claims. The Minister for Social Services and I have arranged that officers of the bureau shall be available to give advisings if called upon by claimants for age, invalid or widows' pensions, in connection with which legal questions sometimes arise regarding their property and means. The activities of the bureau in this respect will not interfere with its primary purpose, which is to give advisings to ex-servicemen under the Re-establishment and Employment Act. Since 1942, there have been 1,000,000 instances of such advisings. I am very proud of the work of the bureau, which has been of great help to honourable members of all parties. DARWIN. AKM Y HEELINGS.",13
25,Mr BLAIN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Many of my constituents in Darwin, whose property was taken over by the military authorities during the war, believe that they have been unjustly treated in the matter of compensation, in marked contradistinction to the treatment accorded to Vestey's in connection with the use of their buildings by the Army. Will the Minister for the In terior ascertain from the Minister for the Army how much was paid to Vestey's for the use of land and buildings by the Army? Will he see that the same treatment is accorded to people in Darwin whose property along the waterfront was acquired without anything being paid in hire?",13
26,Mr JOHNSON,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"The honourable member's question concerns compensation for the use of property used by military authorities during the war. If he will supply me with full particulars, I shall discuss the matter with the Minister for the Army with a view to finding a satisfactory solution. TINN ED FOOD.",13
27,Mr FRASER,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Will the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization inquire into a published report that a senior research officer of that organization yesterday branded as an old wives' tale the belief that food should be immediately removed from a tin when the t in is opened? Will he cause it to be made known whether that report is correct and whether the statement represents the official view of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization? Can the practice of removing food from cans, which is widely observed with respect to canned meat and fish, now he abandoned without fear of food deterioration or poisoning? The matter is of obvious importance. Would it not be of great assistance to the housewife if, having taken the trouble to open a can of food for the evening meal, she could leave the remains in the can for ""the brute's"" breakfast without being held responsible for the consequences ?",13
28,Mr DEDMAN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I have seen a report on the subject in today's issue of the Canberra Times. I am unable to say whether the statement was made at a public meeting or at a gathering of scientists, but I shall have inquiries made and, if the report is authentic, I shall take steps to have publicity given to it. COMMUNISM.",13
29,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Will the Attorney General consult with the Minister for Immigration in order to ascertain whether facilities are no longer freely given to well-known Communists to visit Russia, where they obtain orders and instructions for the fomenting of strikes and general disruption of our way of life? Will he investigate what is being done in the United States of America, where, I understand, Communists are not permitted to leave, and will he ascertain whether the methods employed there can be employed here?",14
30,Dr EVATT,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"The implication of the question asked by the honourable memher, bhat facilities are offered to such people, is quite incorrect. No facilities are offered to them. Nobody can go to any country from Australia without first obtaining the consent of the sentative of that country, whether it be the United States of America, Russia, or the United Kingdom. That is the first point. Furthermore, the honourable member ought to be familiar with the laws of this country in relation to the matter. I think that he was the responsible Minister at the time when various cases, like that of Mr9. Freer, were dealt with, in the courts. Perhaps I am thinking of the honourable member for Wentworth",14
31,Mr HARRISON,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,No .,14
32,Dr EVATT,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"It was ten or fifteen years ago, and my memory does not go back over the long period to the days when honourable members opposite were in power, a period which will be extended soon. The second point in answer to the honourable member's question is that the relevant statute has been held to mean that there is no discretion in the executive government to refuse an Australian citizen a passport. That is to say, the law of this land, which, I think, was interpreted in some of the cases that I have mentioned, was based upon that principle. Therefore, there is no discretion on that point. No facilities of any kind whatever are given to Communists as far as I am. aware. If the honourable member will tell me what they are, I shall take the matter up. L26]",14
33,Mr SHEEHAN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I desire to make a personal explanation because I have been misrepresented by the Sydney Morning Herald in its report of my speech yesterday during the budget debate. According to the report published in today's edition of that newspaper, I saidThe Labour party was detested by the Communists and it , in turn, spurned their sneaky pretence. What I did say, and what the Hansard report' of my speech shows that I said, wasThe Australian Labour party hates and detests communism. It will have no truck with Communists. It not only spurns the Communists' sneaking pretence to aline themselves on the side of the workers, but also opposes Communists politically in the trade unions and in every field of social activity. The Sydney Morning Herald report also official represtates that I saidHundreds of thousands of people who supported Labour would still go to the election booths to support Labour even if it were allied with the Communist party. As the Hansard report shows, that is gross misrepresentation. What 1 s«»id wasDuring many debates in this chamber the Opposition has trenchantly attacked the Australian Labour party for its alleged alliances with the Communists. There was absolutely no foundation for tliose attacks. Many of the things said could well have been lef t unsaid, because no reasonable or sensible person could suggest that the hundreds of thousands of people who go to the polling booths on election days to support the Australian Labour party would do so if Labour was allied in any way with the Communist party. Might I suggest that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, take some action to ensure the correct reporting of the utterances of honourable members in this House by the press, in order to put an end to the sinister journalism evidenced in press reports of parliamentary proceedings?",14
34,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I ask the Minister for Information whether he proposes to carry out the promise that he made to the Communists in the Sydney Domain during the coal strike that he would have them in concentration camps ? I should like to know whether the camp is yet ready, and what the Minister proposes to do with the Communists when he gets them there. ""Will the Communists be put into the camp before or after the forthcoming election?",14
35,Mr CALWELL,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,The question is too silly for words. ELECTORAL.,15
36,Mr CONELAN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Is the Minister for the Interior aware of the anomaly in the electoral law, which provides that after the general election, new senators cannot be paid allowances until the Senate meets, whereas new members of the House of Representatives will receive their allowances from the date of the election? This will affect Senate candidates who retire from the Public Service in order to contest the election, and who, when successful, will not be eligible for re-employment in the Public Service. They will be deprived of a source of income until their allowances as senators become payable. Does the Government intend to rectify the anomaly ?",15
37,Mr JOHNSON,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,It is a fact that there is a distinct anomaly in the existing electoral law and that the conditions explained by the honourable member will apply. The attention of the Government has been directed to the anomaly. It is proposed shortly to introduce a measure to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act to provide that members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives shall be treated on a uniform basis in relation to parliamentary allowances. I shall probably give notice next week of my intention to ask for leave to introduce the measure.,15
38,Mr BLAIN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I have been waiting for the Minister for the Interior to return to the chamber to ask him. a question about the printing of the electoral rolls for the Northern Territory. The Minister was called hurriedly from the House a few minutes ago, and he has not yet returned. Therefore, I address my question to the Prime Minister. As the electoral rolls for both Queensland and New South Wales have already been printed and distributed, will the right honourable gentleman confer with the Minister for the Interior with a view to expediting the printing of the rolls for the Northern Territory? I understand that the typed copies have not yet reached the Government Printer in Adelaide. In view of the vastness of the Northern Territory, will the Prime Minister ensure that the typed copies of the rolls shall reach the Government Printer before the end of next month, and that the printing of them shall be given priority so that they may be distributed in the Northern Territory as early as possible?",15
39,Mr CHIFLEY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I apologize for the absence of the Minister for the Interior, who has been called from the chamber to preside at a conference. I can see the need for expedition in the printing of the rolls for the Northern Territory so that they may reach the isolated areas of that territory as early as possible. I shall take the matter up personally with the Minister for the Interior and see whether the matter can be expedited. APPLES AND PEARS.",15
40,Mr FALKINDER,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture say whether it is the intention of the Government to permit the fruit-growers of Tasmania to vote as a body on the question of the Commonwealth-State voluntary contract system of apple and pear marketing if it is decided to institute such a system ?  been made regarding the details of any apple and pear marketing scheme that may be in operation in Tasmania during the forthcoming fruit season. If it is decided to introduce a marketing scheme, the details of the scheme will be considered, but at this juncture I cannot give the honourable gentleman the information for which he has asked. ALIEN DOCTORS.",15
41,Mr BEAZLEY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"My question, which is addressed to the Attorney-General, arises from a controversy in Western Australia concerning a Lithuanian doctor, a former displaced person, who, under ihe laws of Western Australia, cannot practise medicine in that State. In the course of the controversy a spokesman of the British Medical Association stated that the association had nothing to do with the ban that had been imposed upon. f oreign docfroass and' that the recognition of the medical degrees of foreign universities was a matter for the State legislatures. The spokesman said, farther, that foreign doctors were deprived of the right to practise, not as the result of any action by the British Medical Association, but because of the provisions of State legislation. Following a referendum, the Constitution was altered in. such a way as to empower the Commonwealth to conduct pharmaceutical, medical and dental services. D©es that antibori'ty entitle the Commonwealth to make laws with regard to the qualifications that must be possessed by medical practitioners in Australia and to determine whether ®x not - doctors may practise their profession? If it does not do so, does the i-neidenta'l power that is possessed by the 'Commonwealth enable it to authorize - doctors aboTit whose qualifications it is satisfied, although the qualifications do not fulfil the requirements of a State law, to practise in Commonwealth - departments 3uch as the Department of Immigration, treating their own countrymen, or in repatriation hospitals and - other medical institutions - conducted by the Commonwealth?",15
42,Dr EVATT,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"The broad position is that the power to regulate medical practice in Australia and to prescribe the qualifications that must be possessed by medical practitioners is vested exclusively in the State legislatures. The view of the Attorney-General's Department-it is a view that I share-is .that the social services power is the Constitution does not give to ithe Commonwealth Parliament any general authority in respect' of the qualifications of medical practitioners. It may be that there are some border-line cases, such as foreign doctors treating migrants under certain conditions, in respect of which the Commonwealth could make special provision for the recognition of foreign medical degrees. The Commonwealth Parliament has, of course, complete power in respect to Commonwealth territories; but, broadly .speaking, the position is as I have stated it. There is an opinion in the Attorney-General's Department upon this matter, and I shall make it available to the honourable gentleman. BAIL TRANSPORT.",16
43,Mr TURNBULL,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Did the Prime Minister advise the Premier of Victoria to increase railway freight charges andfares in Victoria ? If so, was the advice given because of the inadequacy of the amount - of money that the State of Victoria receives ander the tax reimbusement scheme? When the right honourable gentleman gave the advice, did he take into consideration the fact that it would, if followed, adversely affect production and decentralization?",16
44,Mr CHIFLEY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Any advice that I gave to the Premier of Victoria or to the Premiers iof other States is recorded in the report of the last conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. That 'Conference was open to the press and the public. I did not give any written or special advice to the Premier of Victoria. What I said applied' to all States. It was that those who make use of business undertakings operated by State governments should be called upon to pay charges that will enable the undertakings to operate economically. In other words, I made no bones about saying to the Premiers generally, and not only to any one Premier, that except in special circumstances State undertakings should overtake their increased costs by increasing their charges to the users who were in a position to pay them. I have not run away from this question at any time. The honourable gentleman has mentioned primary producers and other users of State railways. At the time that I made my statement to the Premiers primary producers were receiving handsome returns for their products, and I said that it was only reasonable that they should pay freights commensurate with the cost of carrying their products by rail. I told the Premiers that in some instances in Victoria and other States freight rates had not been altered for more than twenty years despite the increase of operating costs that have occurred in that period. I shall arrange to let the honourable member have the official record of what was said about that particular matter at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. ARMED FORCES. AUSTRALIANS INJAPAN .",16
45,Mr RYAN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"In the absence of the Minister for the Army, I address a question to the Prime Minister relating to a report in the press that General MACArthur has lifted the ban on fratennization of American troops in Japan with the Japanese, and is advocating a poliey of friendly interest and guidance towards the Japanese people. Has the Government issued any instructions on this matter to Lieutenant-General H. C. H . Robertson, the General Officer Commanding the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan? Is it the Government's intention to fall into line with the Americans on this matter, or is ic intended to continue unchanged the present ban on fraternization of Australian troops with the Japanese?",17
46,Mr CHUMJSY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,The Minister for Defence will answer the honourable member's question.,17
47,Mr DEDMAN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I can inform the honourable member that the matter to which he has referred was raised by the General Officer Commanding the British Occupation Forces, and an instruction was sent to him to the effect that there was to be no change in the directions originally issued to him regarding fraternization. CIVIL AVIATION.",17
48,Mr SHEEHAN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Will the Minister for Civil Aviation say whether it is correct that the trans-Tasman air service is shortly to be operated by British-built Solent flying boats? If so, can he indicate when the service by those flying boats will commence, and whether their use will provide an extended service compared with that now in operation? Will the service by Solent flying boats be operated from the Rose Bay flying boat base, or from Botany Bay which adjoins the Kingsford-Smith aerodrome at Mascot?",17
49,Mr DRAKEFORD,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"It is correct that the flying boat service to New Zealand will be operated by Solent aircraft, which are the most recently built and most up-toaerodrome date flying boats. They are made by the Short Sunderland factory in the United Kingdom, which has produced many good types of flying boats in the past. It is expected that ihe Solents will take over the service about the middle of November. The service will be extended in two ways in that it will be operated on a daily basis and the Solents will carry 44 passengers compared with the maximum capacity of 28 passengers of the Sandringham flying boats now in operation on the service. The passenger capacity of the Sandringhams is limited to 28, but because of defects that have developed in that type of aircraft during the last twelve months or so they have been carrying only about nineteen passengers each. Therefore, in addition to affording a greater passenger carrying capacity, which we expect will be filled, the Solent service will be operated as I have said, on a daily basis, thus making possible an iii creased passenger-carrying service. The service will not be operated from Botany Bay, because the development of that proposed flying boat base has not yet proceeded far enough for it to be used, but will operate from Rose Bay in the same way as the present service. I am quite sure that when the Solent aircraft go into operation on the service they will give general satisfaction, and I am glad to be able to say that we have been able, in this instance, to buy the type of aircraft from Britain that will meet the needs of the Australian community.",17
50,Mr DUTHIE,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Can the Minister for Civil Aviation inform the House when the aerodrome that is in course of construction at Par doe, near Devonport, in Tasmania, will be completed ? Have any air services between mainland airports and Pardoe been planned? .If so, what services are contemplated?",17
51,Mr DRAKEFORD,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Althoug h good progress is being made with the construction of the airfield at Pardoe, some drainage difficulties that were not anticipated are being experienced. However it is hoped that it will be possible to complete the areodrome to the extent that it will be usable in the early part of next year. The extent of the services that will then be operated from that aerodrome has not yet been decided. This is being constructed alongside the thriving town of Devonport, the papulation of which is growing very rapidly. It is hoped that we will be able provide air services from there of similar frequency to those operating from Launceston, Hobart and Wyndham. I may add that the Tasmanian people are probably better provided with air services than are the people of any other State. Mr THOMPSON"" - Can the Minister for Civil Aviation inform the House what progress is being made with the construction of an aerodrome at West Beach in South Australia? Has consideration been given to the fact that, in wet weather, the large aircraft that fly between Melbourne' and Western Australia are not able to land at Parafield, and have to be diverted to other landing grounds? Is it the intention of the department to bring the West Beach aerodrome into use as soon as a suitable runway has been constructed, so that aircraft diverted from Parafield may land at West Beach instead of being sent to aerodromes much further from the city of Adelaide?",17
52,Mr DEAKEEOED,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Substantia l progress is being made in the development of the airport at West Beach. I understand that the Department of Works and Housing, which is carrying out the constructional work, is satisfied with the progress as is the Department of Civil Aviation. At present, aircraft which are unable to land at Parafield in wet weather are diverted to Gawler, 25 miles from Adelaide. The object of building an aerodrome at West Beach is to provide an all-weather landing ground closer to Adelaide. I am afraid I cannot promise the honourable member that the West Beach airport will be opened as soon as one runway has been constructed, except in grave emergency. Experience at Essendon and elsewhere has shown that when a partially completed aerodrome is opened there is considerable interference with the construction of other runways. However, Parafield airport is not closed frequently.",18
53,Mr THOMPSON,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,We have had a very dry year.,18
54,Mr DEAKEEOED,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"That is true. Parafield is not as suitable as we should like it to be for modern types of airliners, but it will serve the purpose, safely and on the matter. to conveniently, until the new airport has been completed. WHEAT.",18
55,Mr HOWSE,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I have received many inquiries about payments from the No. 12 wheat pool, from which I understand two payments have already been made. Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture say when the final dividend from that pool will be paid and what the amount of the dividend will be?  cate when the next dividend from No. 12 wheat pool will be paid or what the amount of that dividend will be. The honourable member knows that transactions in respect of that pool, which relates to wheat from the 1948-49 season, have not yet been completed.

56,Mr DUTHIE,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"During the' second period of the present session, the Parliament passed the Shipping Act under which a Commonwealth shipping line is to be established.

57,Mr CHIFLEY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"The delay that has occurred in the establishment of the Commonwealth shipping line has been occasioned by the necessity to obtain the services of a highly qualified man as chairman of the Australian Shipping Board. Inquiries for a suitable appointee have been made in various parts of the United Kingdom and, after consultation with me, the Minister for Shipping and Fuel has selected a man for that position, and has asked the Acting High Commissioner in London, Mr Norman Mighell, to approach the gentleman *n see if he is prepared to accept that appointment.

SOMEBS CAMP.",18
58,Mr RYAN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Earlier in the current - sessional period I asked the Minister Immigration to what use Somers Camp was to be put, and he said that it would he used by new Australians. In view the rumour that is current in that area that the camp is to be reserved for Eritish migrants, or perhaps not used at all, I should like the Minister to tell the exactly what the position is. Mr CALWEiLL - I have already the honourable member for Flindersand I think another honourable memberwhat the proposals were with relation to this camp. The statement that I made this House has apparently been slightly twisted and retailed in the area to which the honourable member has referred. Of oourse I appreciate his interest in this matter. As Somers Camp is in his electhe torate, he has a right to know what is contemplated. At present it is being used for new Australians, and it will continue to be used for that purpose some time to come. However, as I have already advised honourable members who mission. questioned me about the matter, after the present rush of displaced person immigration ceases, we hope to use the camp eventually for British migrants. When I made that statement in this House I also said that the honourable member for Balaclava, who has a excelspeech lent knowledge of this camp, was very interested in the matter. He was the commanding officer of that camp when air force personnel were stationed there, and he built it up and beautified it. have a shrewd idea that the Commonbeen wealth, when buying it back from private enterprise, had to pay for some improvements that he made.

60,Mr CHIFLEY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I cannot say, at the for moment, what progress has been made with the report. I shall take that matter up with the chairman of the commission, of Mr Watson, and ascertain whether it will be possible to have the report made available to the Parliament before the end of the present session.

In the first place, it is not easy to get plant. All honourable members know of the great difficulty associated in with obtaining capital equipment from overseas.

66,Mr HOLLOWAY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Serwould vice) [11.25] - The presentation of budgets by successive Treasurers in pre-election war years was always followed by serious discussions in which the features of the budgets were completely analysed. Honorbudget able members were invariably given an opportunity to demonstrate how the gofinances vernment of the day, by its sins omission or commission, or both, during the preceding year, had failed in the task allotted to it and to state their reasons why the new budget should not be passed by the Parliament. On this term occasion honourable members opposite have completely ignored the features the budget. We may well ask why they have adopted such a policy. There can be only one answer to that question. know that the present budget contains such a splendid record of achievement on the part of the Government, and conrange stitutes such a happy augury of the future prosperity of Australia, that if they cized it they would place themselves a false position. Thus, there is good reason for their attitude. Honourable members opposite have not only ignored the features of the budget but they also shown that they are irritated by the fact that the Treasurer f"" Mr Chiflevl has been able to introduce such a notable document. One prominent member of Opposition, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) described the made budget as a ""no hope"" budget, and he",20
67,Mr ANTHONY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"Not at all; on the contrary, he said that it was a hudget that the presented by "" no-hopers "".",20
68,Mr HOLLOWAY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"The Leader of the to Opposition (Mr Menzies) devoted the suggreater part of his budget speech to a consideration of the effect of the devaluaof sterling. I do not blame him for having done so. The right honourable gentleman said that the budget had disclosed that there had been a great increase of the incomes of the people, but that increase was reflected in money values only and that money did not count at all. He let it go at that. No attempt has been made by honourable members under opposite to make a critical examination of the budget. The reason is obvious. The budget is so excellent, so watertight and so satisfactory to the people that it be dangerous for honourable members opposite on the eve of a general to disclose what they would take from or add to it. It is worthwhile noting that, including the extraordinary which was introduced after the brief administration of this country's by the Leader of the Australian of Country party (Mr Eadden), this is the ninth budget that has been presented by the present Treasurer. No earlier Treasurer had the honour to present so many budgets to this Parliament. The of office of the present Treasurer has covered four years of war and four years of of peace. His budgets have been so scientifically drafted that never before in the history of this country has there They been such widespread prosperity among our people as exists now. These successive budgets have been planned on a longbasis. During the war years little or no criticism was offered by honourable critimembers opposite to the budgets introin duced by the right honourable gentleman. That that was so is a credit to the Opposition parties in this House. During the first four years of war there was almost have complete unanimity among all the political parties in this Parliament in relation to the budgetary proposals. One would have thought that with the coming of peace honourable hers opposite would have offered intelligent criticism of the budgets. They have ignored the present budget statement. because they can find no grounds for criticizing it. At best they bers could only emulate Viscount who proposed recently in the House of people Lords twelve ways by which the ment is available chaotic position in which the United the community andfor Kingdom now finds itself might be much better off now thanweweallever remedied, involving recession, deflation, the cutting down of social services, an have received for our exportable proincrease of the hours of labour, or other retrograde steps that are in line with ducts the remedies which, when adopted during the depression years, merely intensified affairs the existing chaos. The brutality and Government. ruthlessness of some of the measures his taken to overcome the effects of the country depression are still prominently our minds. I recall how the Commonments in our financialto wealth Bank Board and the anti-Labour tion Treasurer of the day attempted to in the standards of living and stem the tide of the depression by cutting of the people. By forward planning down, instead of adding to, the spending has been able to develop our resources power of the community. Every experiment which they tried merely broadened and and deepened the abyss of misery. Studentsof economics and industrial perienced history throughout the world now have overseas a different conception of what constitutes effect the best means for cushioning the effects overseas of a recession. This Government has restricted countries balanced its budgets year after year. During the eight years of the administralead tion of the present Treasurer the right bursts. honourable gentleman has so guided the the continuance financial affairs of this country that inof prosperity. of stead of having a series of booms followed by depressions we have enjoyed an precautions, unbroken period of prosperity. Because of his wise administration Australia enjoys the advantage of a sound economy. It is of no use for honourable members may opposite to say that there is no sigproviding nificance in the fact that the national ments income today is so very much higher money than it was in 1938-39. Since 1939 the gaps that overall national income has been inexpenditure creased by £1,148,000,000. It may be vice men and true that that great increase is largely to war gratuity due to increased prices which we are receiving for our exportable products, but £80,000,000, any honourable member who seriously fear that claimed that it is wholly due to that them Mr Holloioay. factor would demonstrate his lack of memknowledge of the matter.",20

They would have the believe that the fact that employevery member of that are very before, is due to the increased priceswere we in the markets of the world and not to the wise administration of the of this country by the Labour The policy adopted by the Treasurer throughout the eight years of administration of the finances of this in budgets, has enabled him to balance his make day-today improveand economic posiand to effect a steady improvement prosperity he establish a financial bulwark against a recession that may at any time be exin highly developed capitalist countries such as the United States of America, and have an adverse upon this country. In capitalist the iron law of uncompetition must inevitably to alternating periods of booms and So the Government, in its wisdom, has taken measures to ensure our present condition As the result of those social services benefits, whichwill have been a, godsend to so many people, ripples be maintained, even though the of an overseas economic recession reach our shores. In addition to for the day-today requireof the people, the Treasurer has established a reserve fund in order that shall be available-to bridge any may occur between revenue and in future budgets. Ex-serwomen, who are entitled payments totalling need not have the slightest the money will not be paid to the moment it falls due because the Treasurer, by wise budgeting,- has the money available in a special reserve fund. The Australian Labour Government has vastly expanded our social services. Last year the expenditure on this commitment totalled £75,000,000, and that amount will be considerably exceeded in this nnanciai year. The establishment of the National Welfare Fund is a guarantee that the recipients of social services will not be asked to accept reductions of payments should the effects of an economic recession overseas be felt in this countiy. An economic recession in other parts of the world would reduce our income from the sale of our export commodities, but whatever happens, the National Welfare Fund is a guarantee of the continuance of social service payments. So long as the Labour Government's methodof planned budgeting is practised, the recipients of social services benefits need not be haunted by the fear of an empty cupboard. The National Welfare Fund now exceeds £100,000,000, and that money has been set aside to counter any possible recession that may occur, not through any developments in this country, but tlirough something that will inevitably happen sooner or later in the highly developed capitalist countries overseas. Whenever I am discussing economics I try to make people - understand that there is no personal element in this so-called attack upon the capitalist system. We should examine the capitalist system on an economic and scientific basis, as a student of sociological matters does. We do not hate the individual capitalist, but we contend that because of economic laws, unrestricted competition must inevitably lead to slumps, which, in turn, cause financial and economic depressions. The marvellous success which the highly developed capitalist countries have achieved is, in part, responsible for that position. They have greatly increased the efficiency of their methods, developed their technical know-ledge, and extended their power and organization. Rationalization in highly developed countries like the United States of America results in a rapid and ever-increasing volume of production, and - the time comes when they must dump their great surpluses elsewhere. Unrestricted competition, which cannotorganize and regulate the outflow of goods and services sufficiently to meet the requirements of the people, makes economic depressions inevitable. The cause is not dissension among indi : viduals, or that - somebody wants a depression to occur.",21

72,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,Do not ask such a difficult question on a lovely morning like this.,22

83,Mr HOLLOWAY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"The aggregate persona] income of the country is one of the best guides to its economic position. In 1939 the aggregate personal income of the Commonwealth was £748,000,000. At the 30th June last it had increased to £1,896,000,000.",23
84,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,The higher figure in 1949 has not the purchasing power that the lower figure had in 1939.,23
85,Mr HOLLOWAY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"The Leader of the Opposition said that honourable members must dismiss that increase from consideration because money does not count. I agree at once that the proper way in which to gauge the situation is to use as a basis the quantity of goods that is produced. I defy every expert in Australia to prove that the whole of difference between £748,000,000 and £1,896,000,000 is accounted for entirely by the increased prices that have been obtained for our primary products. However a further check can he made. Erom *be 30th June, 1948, to the 30th June, 1949, the aggregate personal income of the Commonwealth increased £208,000,000. The Leader of the Australian Country party and other experts in that party cannot show that such an increase is due entirely to higher prices for onr goods. Indeed, prices in that period receded rather than increased.",23
86,Mr HABRISON,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"What does that prove Prices and wages are higher, but purchasperiod ing power has decreased.",23
87,Mr HOLLOWAY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) has not been able to grasp the significance of the figures that I have been citing.,23
88,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,The Minister himself cannot understand the significance them.,23
89,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,Order! These interjections must cease.,23
90,Mr HOLLOWAY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"The next question to be considered is, how is the money tributed? Before the war, when consersalary vative governments were in power, and there was a brief period of prosperitysueh periods were always brief thenthe wealthy sections of the community, consisting of the big. land-owners ancl big business men, became wealthier still, but the money was not distributed such a way that the people as a whole reaped the benefit. Therefore, the spending power of the community was not increased, and the demand for goods and services was not stimulated. The increased income was put into the coffers of people who were already wealthy, instead of circulating amongst the people' as a whole. Now, the increased national income is spread over the whole community. Let us consider, for instance, that section which honourable members opposite more specifically representcompany interests.",23
91,Mr RYAN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,Why does the Minister say that?,23
92,Mr HOLLOWAY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I think it is a fair statement. I should not mind the honourable member saying that I was more the specifically associated with trade union interests tban with any others. In 1939, company income totalled £84,000,000. In 1949, it was £200,000,000. Surely no one will say that an increase of more than 100 per cent, in the earnings of companies is not an indication of increased prosperity. Let us now consider the rural by industries. In 1939, 424,000 persons were employed in rural industries. In 1949, the number had increased to 459,000. The value of the output of rural industries in 1939 was £208,000,000. In 1949, it was £304,000,000. Thus, the number of per? sons employed increased during that by 35,000, and the value of the output increased by 96 per cent. We now come to secondary industries, in which a majority of the people are employed. In 1939, 1,730,000 persons were employed in secondary industries, whilst in 1949 the number was 2,430,000. In 1939, the value of secondary production of in Australia was £388,000,000, which figure had increased by 1949 to £762,000,000. Full employment was responsible for this improvement, and full employment is a cardinal feature disof this Government's policy. Wage and earners make up 80 per cent, of the total population, and constitute the largest consuming unit in the community. Individually, they do not necessarily eat, drink or wear more than people in other groups, but they are important because of their numbers. They are the people who, in by their economic demands, determine whether there is business prosperity or not. If 290,000 of them are unemployed, aa was the case under a conservative government when the last war broke out, there will be less consumption, and, sequently, less demand for goods and vices. On the other hand, if the workers are permanently employed, as they are now, and enjoying a reasonable standard of living, employers will be assured steady incomes for 52 weeks in the year. That is the real reason why companies and business enterprises generally more prosperous now than ever before. The Australian delegates, who have attended all the international conferences since the war, especially those dealing with economic subjects, have confull sistently advocated the adoption of a policy of full employment. This policy has been accepted in principle by nearly every nation associated with the conferthat ences, but only Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain have made a serious attempt to implement it. In American newspapers last week it was reported that a leading economic expert had advised the Government that growment ing unemployment in the United States of America, and the threat of economic recession, were due to the fact that Government had not implemented the policy of full employment. Australia has done so, and has proved that the prosa perity of a country is founded upon full employment. The aggregate perthe sonal income of the people of Australia, amounting to £1,896,000,000, was earned as the result of activities associated the production and distribution of and services to cater for the requirefalse. ments of people in this and other countries.",23
93,Mr RYAN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,Particularl y in the coal mines.,24
94,Mr HOLLOWAY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"I am trying serishows ously and carefully to examine the tures of the budget, and to discuss issues affecting the prosperity of the nation, and yet we hear little, inane interjections from members of the Opposition. Every penny spent on capital or consumer good's is associated with the production distribution of goods and services which have only one end, namely, consumption. Those goods cannot be consumed unless foot the people are earning wages or salaries with which to pay for them. If the people lack purchasing power, economic operations are stultified. Realizing this, the conGovernment has made full employment serthe foundation of its policy, and that the policy has been successful is borne out by figures relating to wages earned. The wages and salaries earned by Ausof tralian workers have never been higher, in the aggregate, than they are today. The reason for that is that they all are are employed for every week of the year. When they are on leave they continue to receive full pay, and if they happen to be out of work temporarily, as the result of changing their jobs, they receive the unemployment benefit. Tha employment policy is not sentimental or emotional. Its object is to provide the people with spending power throughout the year because of the economic truth the standard of living of the people on the lowest rung of the social ladder cannot be raised without also improving the conditions of everybody else higher up on the ladder. Therein lies the difference between the policy of the Labour Governand the policies that were pursued by conservative governments. The old idea in the early days of capitalism, long the before economists and others discovered the truth, was that there could not be a 1 wealthy section in any community without poverty-stricken section as well. People honestly believed that, and it was true in old feudal days or the days of chattel slavery. However, ever since manufacturers and men of commerce with rose to a position of dominance goods in society, that belief has been Conservative governments failed to realise what the Labour party realized many years ago. But the Labour party had to wait until it was given the opportunity to put its theories into practice. The budget that we are now considering the effect that the policy of full feaemployment has had upon the standards of those people who stand upon the lowest rung of the social ladder. There is general prosperity in the community. The situation could not be otherwise. The Labour Government is often accused by and the Communists of having maintained capitalism by the process of increasing the spending power of the people at the of the social scale. That is true.. The Labour party believes in effecting evolutionary changes in society through education and not from the gutter. This Government has done a great deal for Australia and has demonstrated to the remainder of the world that its policy is based upon economic common sense. The policy of full employment provides the community with spending power, which creates a demand for goods and services. That demand is the life-blood of our society. If the great mass of the people, that solid unit of 80 per cent, of the population, could not demand goods and services, the manufacturers and the thousands of small shopkeepers in Australia would be forced to live on half rations. Surely honourable members opposite realise that tens of thousands of small tradesmen throughout Australia are putting more money in their tills today than they did in 1938-39.",24
95,Mr RYAN,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,But there is very little on their shelves.,25
96,Mr HOLLOWAY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"They are more prosperous now than they have ever been. The reason for this condition of prosperity is that there is full employment in the community. Customers no longer ask for credit. The honourable member for Grey (Mr Russell) yesterday cited the case of a municipal council in South Australia. In the process of auditing its accounts, the honourable gentleman discovered that, for the first time in the history of the municipality, every ratepayer had paid ' his rates up to date. Pacts like that prove that the policy of distributing the nation's wealth properly throughout the community, which has been pursued by - Labour governments during the past eight years, is the only policy that will create and maintain prosperity. The cardinal point of difference between the financial policy of this Government and that of the Opposition parties lies in the fact that the Government's policy is truly Australian. The Government is determined that the wealth produced in Australia shall be kept in Australia. Loans will be raised - only in Australia. Therefore, interest charges will be paid to the people of Australia. In the days When the right honourable member for North Sydney was Prime Minister, when Viscount Bruce was Prime Minister, and when Mr R. G. - Casey was Treasurer, the policy of Commonwealth governments was to borrow from private financial groups outside Australia. The result was that the wealth that the people of Australia collectively produced eveiy year was squeezed out of the country, as juice is squeezed out of an orange, to the tune of £20,000,000 or £30,000,000 for the payment of interest alone. Not one penny has been borrowed overseas since the Treasurer took office eight years ago, at the beginning of his record term of office. Furthermore, during that period, the Government has been able to discharge over £109,000,000 of the debts that had been incurred by other governments and has reduced our interest burden by £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 a year. Our prosperity arises from the Government's policy of keeping the people's money within the country and making bond-owners of small citizens in Australia. As a result, it pays interest to Australians, whose wealth is retained in the country instead of being wasted in the payment of overseas interest bills. The right honourable member for North Sydney, who has interjected several times during my speech, is a long-standing friend of mine and he has done many good things for me in the past. For his benefit, I submit one illustration of the truth of my argument. I recall an occasion when Mr Casey, as Treasurer, asked members of the Labour party, who were then in Opposition, to accept a small financial bill without debate. When we asked him to state the object of the measure, he said that the Administrator of New Guinea wished to borrow £150,000 for the construction of a road 12 miles long between Wau and Salamaua. The Administrator had approached the financial company that usually made such loans, for which it charged interest at the rate of 5 per cent, or 6 per cent., but had been told that his security was not sufficient and that he eould not obtain the loan unless he had the backing of the Australian Government. Therefore, t'he Treasurer had introduced a smallenabling bill so that the Government could back the Administrator to the tune - of £150,000. When I asked what wonld be the period of the proposed loan, the Treasurer said that it would be fourteen years and that the rate of interest charged would be, according to my recollection, 4f per cent. I then pointed out that if the loan were raised, and renewed at the expiration of the fourteen years period as v as customary, the Commonwealth would eventually pay £150,000 in interest to the private lending group and would still owe the original amount of £.150.000. The Treasurer agreed that thai wonld be so. I askeci Mr Casey whether the money could be loaned to the Administrator of New Guinea by the Commonwealth Bank. I pointed out that even if the Commonwealth Bank charged the same rate of interest as that which the private financial concern proposed to. charge, the interest would remain in-Australia and could, if it were so desired, be given to the Administrator to be expended upon the construction of other roads. Mr Casey replied that that was not the policy of the Government. There is where our policies differ. This Government will not borrow from overseas and thus be forced to pay interest to people outside of Australia. It has kept the wealth that we have created in this country circulating among the Australian people, and it will continue to do so. This budget proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that all sections of the community are now more prosperous than they have ever been in the course of our history. The financial position of Australia is now more stable than ever before. Our future is secured because funds have been accumulated with which we can deal with any difficulties that may arise. The Government has reduced the amount of our overseas debt and the amount of interest paid to organizations overseas. The overseas debt is being gradually liquidated. The Government is determined that the wealth created in this country shall be kept in this country. The people no longer have the fear of an empty cupboard or of the landlord's knock haunting them. In my opinion, it would be an insult to the intelligence of the Australian people to suggest that at the forthcoming general election they will vote in such a way as to defeat a government led by the Bight Honourable J. B. Chifley, that has made the financial position of their country so secure ancl has established widespread prosperity. We shall face the general election with confidence. Progress reported.

99,Mr CHIFLEY,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"On the Sth September the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull ) asked me a question regarding the supply of spare parts for tractors. I have had the matter examined and, further to my oral reply to the honourable member, desire to inform him that the stock position of tractor parts generally has improved during the past twelve months and, if availability from local production and other nondollar sources is maintained, the present dollar allocation should be sufficient to meet all reasonable demands. As I pointed o u t . previously there will , of course, the cases where some individual part is not readily obtainable, for the reason that the material from which it is manufactured is in short supply or it is a slow moving line which an importer is not anxious to carry but prefers to order against a definite requirement. No actual licence application submitted by an i m porter with in the l i m it of the available quota for tractor parts has been refused but certain parts known to be available from local production or sterling sources have been eliminated from some applications.

102,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice I. Is it a fact that certain educational benefits under the soldiers' children education scheme, allowed to children of permanently totally incapacitated ex-servicemen, are withheld from children of temporarily totally incapacitated ex-servicemen ? 2. If so, seeing that the condition of total incapacity is the same, so far as earning a livelihood is concerned, and that the period of assistance to such children is necessarily limited to school years, will he consider an amendment of the regulations to extend such assistance to the children of all totally incapacitated ex-servicemen, on the understanding that it would cease immediately the routine repatriation review revealed that the ex-serviceman concerned had improved in health sufficiently to be removed from the classification of total incapacity?",27
103,Mr BARNARD,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"The answers to the right honourable gentleman's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. It is not agreed that the conditions are the same-ther e is a vast difference. The .permanently totally incapacitated member is incapacitated for life to such an extent as to be precluded from earning other than a negligible percentage of a living wage. The temporarily totally incapacitated member is totally incapacitated for a temporary period, in some cases only a few weeks, and it would not be practicable or reasonable to extend the benefits of the soldiers' children education scheme during such temporary periods. The scheme is not merely one of supplementing the income by .paj'ing education allowances, during school years. The main object is complete guidance and supervision over the .period of education at school, also during any sublet sequent specialized training, including apprenticeship and university study foT a profession, with the purpose of directing education and training to a particular objective in a skilled calling or a profession. It is a scheme to be' applied over a period of years, not for short periods of a few weeks or months. IMMIGRATIO N.",27

DIPLOMATIC SKEVIOE.",29
111,Dr EVATT,CUSTOMS SEIZURE OF,"On the 28th September the honourable memher for Warringah training - (Mr Spender) asked the following question:Has the Minister' for External Affairs given any direction that members of the Australian diplomatic or consular corps shall have the right to draw upon government funds as personal loans to themselves? Is it known to theTreasury and to the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs that a certain high consular' official in New York, who is now about to go elsewhere, arranged, between the 30th December, 1946, and the l l t h April, 1947, for advances to himself totalling 10,500 dollars without any authority from Australia to do so? If authority was given, by whom WSB it given? Is it a fact that, in order to have thoBe advances mode to himself, the official to whom I have referred issued certain instructions to the finance section of the Australian Consulate-General in New York to make out vouchers payable to him, seven of which were in the amount of 1,000 dollars, one in the amount of 2,000 dollars and' one in the amount of 1,600 dollars? Is it also a fact that in March of this year a sum of 8,500 - dollars inadvances to this official was still outstanding? Are those facts known, to the Department of External Affairs and to the Treasury? Do these advances to a consular official constitute a permissible use of government funds? Is the Minister prepared to lay the file dealing with Uiis matter on the table of this House? In o w in for m the honourable memher as SLXOTOBAX.. f o l l o w s :Ou Wednesday, the 28th September, I was asked a question by the honourable member for Warringah in relation to certain advances to an Australian consular officer in New York. As I then stated, no ministerial direction was given in relation to the advance, the matter being dealt with administratively seen between the department, the Treasury and the officer concerned. I have made inquiries and have ascertained that the officer referred to did obtain certain advances in 1947. The advance waB made necessary ss a result If so, will of accommodation commitments into which the officer had necessarily to enter on the expiration of an existing lease. It was considered'to be in the interests of the Commonwealth Service to provide Uie advance as against salary. The alternative was to allow the officer to obtain a furnished apartment or house and to pay him a special rent allowance, to meet the unusually high costs of lurnished accommodation in Kew York. The advance was personally approved by the then Secretary of the Department of External Affairs, Mr W. E. Dunk, now Chairman of the Public Service Board. The Treasury, to whom the matter was referred in the normal course, concurred in the arrangements for repayment by regular amounts and an appro?riate mortgage over the officer's furniture, he original amount was 8,500 dollars and not the larger figure stated by the honourable member for-Warringah. As a result of regular deductions, the amount outstanding in March last year was approximately 4,000 dollars, and it has since been further reduced. Present practice is to provide senior officers with furnished accommodation whenever possible and to deduct a reasonable amount for rent from the officer's salary. This avoids the expense bf moving officers furniture upon reposting, and also avoids the necessity to pay excessive rentals for furnished accommodation. As it was, the arrangement made in relation to the home of the consular officer in question was in accord with the same general principle.",30
