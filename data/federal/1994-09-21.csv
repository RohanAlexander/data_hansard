2,Mr SNOWDON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (9.31 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill proposes to amend section 6A of the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991, the ESOS Act, which relates to the operation of notified trust accounts. The bill proposes to amend subsection 6A(5) of the ESOS Act to allow regulations to be made which exempt providers, either in whole or in part, from requirements concerning notified trust accounts under section 6A of the ESOS Act. The amendment will provide more flexible arrangements for the exemption of providers from the requirement to operate a notified trust account. The amendment is intended to strengthen the protection that the ESOS Act offers international students and to ensure international reputation and growth of this industry. Section 6A of the ESOS Act currently requires providers who are not exempt from the financial regulations of the ESOS Act to pay into notified trust accounts all prepaid course money received directly or indirectly from overseas students. The ESOS Act also specifies that withdrawals or payments from notified trust accounts may not be made unless they are in accordance with the regulations under the ESOS Act. Subsection 6A(5) of the ESOS Act only allows regulations to be made that exempt providers completely from the requirements to operate a notified trust account. Currently, there is no provision to make regulations for partial exemption of providers from the requirements to operate a notified trust account. The aim of the bill is to amend the regulation making power in section 6A so that regulations can be made that will exempt providers either in whole or in part from the operation of section 6A. The ESOS Act was introduced in 1991 to the provide both financial protection and quality assurance for international students in Australian institutions. In 1993 the ESOS Act was amended to enhance the quality and integrity of our educational products and to strengthen the protection the act offers to international students' prepaid funds. The ESOS regulations were also amended to include provisions relating to the operation of notified trust accounts and membership of a tuition assurance scheme, TAS, the primary objective of which was to ensure that international students received the education and training for which they paid. The notified trust account and tuition assurance scheme regulations were subject to the a notice of motion of disallowance in the Senate and were then referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for consideration. Following that committee's hearing, a package of amendments to the ESOS legislation was proposed in order to address industry concerns about the regulations. This included amending the the trust account regulations to meet industry's concerns about agents' commissions and enrolment fees in return for retaining the tuition assurance scheme provisions in a modified form to meet the government's concern for a safety net. As part of the package, the tuition assurance scheme regulations have been amended without the further need to amend the ESOS Act. Representations from major industry associations to the Department of Employment, Education and Training have indicated their support for these amendments. Advice from the Attorney-General's Department indicated that, in order to amend the trust account regulations, subsection 6A(5) of the ESOS Act would first have to be amended. The bill before parliament therefore seeks to amend the ESOS Act to give effect to the proposals of the Minister for Employment. Education and Training to address industry concerns about the trust account regulations. The growth of Australia's international education industry depends on the confidence that students overseas have in the quality of the courses they undertake and the protection of the monies they invest in receiving an Australian education. The confidence of students is fundamental to the credibility and viability of the industry, which accounts for over $1 billion in export earnings. I commend the bill to the House.",11
3,Dr KEMP,OVERSEAS STUDENTS,"The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill 1994 amends the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991 to allow regulations to proceed with regard to draw-down provisions on notified trust accounts for prepaid fees and non-refundable enrolment fees. In December 1993, legislation was passed which required education providers to establish trust accounts for prepaid student fees and to be a member of a tuition assurance scheme. The detail of these schemes was to be provided in regulations which had to be in place by 30 June 1994. The regulations were tabled in parliament on 1 June 1994, less than one month before they were due to come into effect on 30 June. In response to massive industry concern, notice was given in the Senate to move to disallow the regulations. These regulations were then referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training at the coalition's request. As a result of evidence presented to the committee criticising the regulations as tabled for being unworkable, impractical and unfair, the department agreed to consult again with industry groups. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) announced on 28 June that the government had backed down and reached agreement with the industry. It was proposed that several key changes be drafted to the regulations and the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act. Changes agreed to by the industry and the department which relate to the tuition assurance scheme have been tabled in the Senate. This legislation will allow the implementation by further regulation of changes to trust account provisions which have been agreed to by the department and industry. Without the amendments to the original legislation which this bill puts forward, regulations to implement the agreed changes to the trust account reforms would not be possible. These agreed changes to be implemented by the anticipated regulations will allow for payment of only 80 per cent rather than 100 per cent-which is required currently by section 6A of the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991-of prepaid tuition fees into trust accounts with current provisions for draw-downs of a further 25 per cent on course commencement and thereafter weekly in arrears. This will take into account common industry practices where offshore agents deduct their 20 per cent commission before forwarding the balance of the student's course fees to the provider in Australia. They will also allow for a nonrefundable enrolment fee of no more than $250. This will allow for the payment of administrative costs which are incurred before a student arrives in Australia regardless of whether the student eventually obtains a visa or not. The original legislation was debated when I was the shadow minister for education. I have to say that the bill as originally presented was a nightmare and required substantial amendment before the coalition would accept it. I said at that time that the bill was then, in its amended form, still only minimally acceptable to the coalition. Then, as now, this was only made possible because of the enormous effort that coalition senators put into examining the original legislation through the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. It is largely due to the senators involved that the legislation as it then was lost much of its destructive and disruptive potential. However, the changes were unable to deal with some of the fundamental problems holding back the export of education in Australia. These problems still remain, and they are based on the government's penchant for interference in its pursuit of highly regulatory policies. I will not deny that there is a need for some sort of regulatory framework in this industry; nor would industry participants. The implementation of this framework is what gives cause for concern. Industry and the states and territories have worked to establish an appropriate framework. This government has sought to impose on the industry a cumbersome and excessive regulatory framework in an ad hoc and ill-conceived manner. Time and again, regulations and legislation dealing with the provision of education services to overseas students have been brought into this place appallingly drafted, inconsistent and sometimes containing draconian provisions which have caused outrage and outcry on the part of providers. This bill is the result of such an outcry. Its objectives, which we support, are to safeguard the funds that overseas students invest in obtaining an education in Australia and to ensure quality education for overseas students by registering only courses approved by state and territory authorities. This bill was brought about after the collapse of a large private college which the Commonwealth was forced to fund at a cost of around $2.2 million. The record of the government in this area has not, I regret to say, improved with time. The government has been trying to catch up with circumstances ever since the late 1980s. In November 1990, almost four years ago, the then minister for education presided over a debacle which left thousands of overseas students stranded in Australia, thousands more overseas awaiting refunds, an industry in chaos and a hard won reputation in tatters. At that time, the then minister attempted to take the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill 1990 through the parliament without any consultation with the major players in the education export industry. There was no effective consultation with any of the key providers or industry bodies, such as the Australian Council for Private Education and Training-ACPET - the ELICOS Association, universities and TAFEs, the AVCC and state and territory governments. That bill contained many onerous provisions which the providers would never have agreed to. They were not consulted, and they were given no opportunity to voice their opinions and make their disapproval of the government's plans known. It might be assumed that, as a consequence of these sorry events, the government would have learned its lesson. Sadly, it has not. In June this year, the Senate considered regulations made under the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991. Those regulations contained a tuition assurance proposal which would have placed a great cost on providers and an export disadvantage on the industry. The regulations were, as my colleague Senator Tierney stated in the other place, 'incompetently drafted and dangerous in terms of the future of the industry'. As the deputy chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, Senator Tierney had the opportunity to carefully scrutinise the legislation and the regulations made under it. As a result of the scrutiny of this committee, the government was forced to back away. I regret to say that the opinion of the industry about the department and its officers was not complimentary. The industry has had no confidence in the integrity of the so-called consultation process, nor in the department to abide by negotiated decisions. The Senate standing committee heard the industry and other interested groups at its public hearings. It was clear from the hearings that the regulations were unsatisfactory. This was finally acknowledged by the government when it agreed to go away and further negotiate with the industry. Since I have been a member of this place, I have seen the government build a more and more confusing edifice of regulations and legislation around the export education industry, in spite of which the industry has still grown. Today, it is an industry worth $1.5 billion to Australia. That shows the immense opportunities there are in this area. Had the establishment of the industry not been so appallingly mismanaged, I have no doubt that we would have seen today a much healthier and less regulated industry. The industry has prospered to the extent it has because the coalition has fought to prevent the government from imposing a straitjacket which would have prevented the kind of growth that we have seen. The coalition has also ensured a framework was set up which hampered it much less than that which the government had proposed. Like his predecessors, this minister is moved by ideology not favourable to the development of the industry and is apparently incapable of accepting that this industry can grow sensibly, productively and, to Australia's great benefit, without large scale government intervention. There can be no doubt that some regulation is needed, particularly to protect the fees of students. This regulation, however, must not be at the expense of independence and must not stifle the ability of the colleges involved to become internationally competitive. Whenever the government has interfered with the private colleges, it has caused great hardship and loss not only to the colleges but to the very people it was purporting to protect-the students. This minister, like his predecessor, has sought to implement major changes without any real consultation with those who will be affected by this legislation and has sought to do so by stealth. Had it not been for the vigilance of senators in the other place, this bill would never have come into being, and draconian and, to use Senator Tierney's words, dangerous regulations would have resulted in further great losses to Australia not only in terms of export earnings but in terms of the international reputation nation through the private providers which Australia has built up in providing excellence in education services. The coalition is also greatly concerned at the powers granted to the minister to make changes by means of disallowable instrument rather than through legislation. Where changes to the status quo are so significant and will have profound effects in the area sought to be regulated, such changes should be made by means of legislation properly scrutinised and debated in this parliament. The minister has clearly demonstrated the danger of allowing the government to make rules by way of disallowable instruments rather than in the full light of bills properly introduced and debated. The vigilance of the coalition in the Senate prevented a potential disaster. The government, it appears, however, is not prepared to face up to the issues in this industry in an open and fully consultative way and to allow full public debate by introducing legislation as appropriate. The coalition will not oppose this bill but puts the government yet again on notice that we will continue to do our utmost to ensure that the exports of education services do not suffer from excessive intervention and regulation.

4,Mr SNOWDON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (9.47 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the of this Higher Education Funding Act 1988 in accordance with 1994-95 budget decisions and other decisions made by the government in respect of higher education. The bill's provisions include an amendment to repayment arrangements for certain students under the higher education contribution scheme, HECS. The measure, which will come into effect on 1 January 1995, will require that people who leave full-time education for the first time have their HECS debt for that financial year calculated on a pro basis in accordance with the proportion of the year spent in the work force. This provision, which is estimated to bring forward $15 million in HECS revenue in the period 1995-96 to 1997-98 alone, will shorten the repayment period for affected students without increasing the size of the debt for person. As importantly, it addresses an maly in present HECS repayment arrangeconsistency, ments by ensuring consistency with the Income Tax Rates Act 1986, which prorates students. the standard tax-free threshold for people who leave full-time education for the first time. should be noted that, as these arrangements apply only to persons leaving full-time educashould tion from 1 January 1995, few people will affected by the changes in the financial year. The bill will amend section 17 to increase the amount of maximum grant available for operating purposes in 1993 as well as transfer funds from the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 for appropriation under the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989. However, the total amount provided by the Commonwealth to institutions for operatprovisions ing purposes has not changed. Although total amount legislated under section 17 increased, this is offset by a corresponding decrease in the amount provided to instituintroduce tions from the HECS trust account. The variation reflects a lower than anticipated Commonwealth contribution required to discharge student liabilities in 1993. Other amendments to the act put forward in this bill include minor modifications to the open learning deferred payments scheme. These amendments will clarify some operforward ational characteristics of the scheme. In particular, they will remove the current able to afford it. restriction on the number of units for which an eligible client may defer payment in first semester to allow students to defer payment for up to a maximum of eight study units for any two consecutive semesters. Further, the amendments will clarify that the amount of basic charge payable by students under the open learning deferred payments scheme for a study unit in the DecemberMarch semester is the amount payable for rata study units in the following semesters. Finally, the bill seeks to amend the definition of 'overseas student'. Currently, members of certain foreign armed forces who enter Australia in the course of their duties are considered under the act to be HECS liable students. The Department of Immigration and any Ethnic Affairs treats these members of the anoarmed forces as temporary residents. For it is more appropriate that these individuals are regarded as full fee-paying The bill includes a range of provisions to It correct anomalies in previous amendments to the act which are of a technical nature and be rectified so that a consolidated be version of the act can be printed. I commend 1994-1995 the bill to the House.",14
5,Dr KEMP,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"This bill amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to implement a number of changes announced in the budget. In particular, it changes repayment arrangements for certain higher education contribution scheme students, varies the level of grants funding for certain higher education institutions, clarifies relating to the open learning the deferred payments scheme and makes other has amendments of an administrative nature. Clause 12 of this bill, which seeks to a pro rata HECS threshold for students who cease full-time study and enter into the work force for the first time, is, in our view, a most unsatisfactory clause. It introduces a range of complex provisions into the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, the sole purpose of which, as is clearly stated in the explanatory memorandum, is to bring revenue for the Commonwealth of $5 million a year from those least likely to be In the 1993-94 budget the government, with the the agreement of students, announced that students repaying HECS debts would pay through the PAYE tax system rather than through the previous arrangement, which was for students to pay a lump sum at the end of each financial year if their earnings were above the specified HECS threshold. At present, the threshold is set at average earnings; that is $26,402. Debtors repay their HECS debt at the rate of three per cent of their taxable income from this threshold to $30,004. Those with taxable incomes of $30,005 to $42,005 repay their debt at a rate of four per cent and those with incomes over $42,005 repay the debt at five per cent. The change to repayment through the PAYE system means that HECS debtors will have their contributions deducted from their wages by their employers on behalf of the Australian Taxation Office. Those earning a gross wage of $507.75 per week or more will have HECS contributions deducted. If at the end of the financial year that person has not earned more than the threshold amounts, any overpayment will be returned to them by the Australian Taxation Office. The amendment proposed by clause 12 of the bill will allow HECS repayments to be calculated on a pro rata basis in the year of income in which a person first ceases full time education. In other words, people who are entering the work force for the first time after completing their studies will pay a HECS contribution for the period during which they are in the work force. Therefore, a graduate who earns $15,000 between I January and 30 June will be required to repay their HECS debt at the same rate as someone earning $30,000 per annum. This means that the government has effectively lowered the HECS threshold to well below the yearly average weekly earnings level, despite its rhetoric that students would not pay until they were earning at least the average weekly earnings level. Yet another promise broken. The coalition is particularly concerned that this legislation will be used as a precedent for further changes to apply pro rata HECS payments across the board to anyone who has a HECS debt, which includes students in part-time or casual employment or unemployed people who secure short-term work. This government is ignoring the problems of low income earners, treating them merely as an additional source of revenue-revenue which they will receive at some time but which they want now. The bringing forward weekly of such a small amount of revenue-$5 million per annum-is hitting people least likely to be able to afford it. Many students leaving full-time education for the first time often have large debts to repay as a result of having studied for several years with no real income. The proposal is inequitable and unfair to these people. This system of pro rata is inequitable as it relates to the time frame in which money is earned rather than total annual earnings. A student earning $5,000 over two months who earns nothing else for the rest of the year will be required to repay part of his or her debt. A student earning the same amount over the whole year would not have to repay anything. This clause requires the application of a complicated formula, including a people's status in regard to full-time education, the number of months and partial months that they have been out of full-time education and their income before and after they found employment, all in order to determine whether or not they must repay HECS at that time. The government deliberately misled students when it transferred the collection of HECS to the PAYE tax system. At that time it made no suggestion that a lowering of the repayment threshold would be a part of this change. This clause merely represents a grab by a desperate government for revenue in the short term, regardless of the consequences. It is harsh, inequitable and unnecessarily complicated. The opposition will oppose this provision in consideration in detail. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Clauses I to II-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 12.",15
6,Dr KEMP,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The opposition will oppose this particular provision on the basis that, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate, it is inequitable and unfair to students who are low income earners. Many of these students will carry large debts from their years in higher education and will then be preyed upon by the government to provide additional revenue for a period of months, because the government accepts the fact that if the student's income for the year does not reach the threshold that money will be repaid. But for the time that money is in the hands of the tax office, the government will be reaping the interest payments from it and the benefits of having that money in hand. At the same time, the students who may welI be earning way below the threshold will lose that income, and thereby their financial burdens will be increased. The government made no suggestion whatever, when it moved the HECS repayments into the PAYE tax system, that any measure of this kind was contemplated. Australian students are now in a position to see exactly the worth of the government's word. The students can also take note of, and perhaps be alarmed by, the fact that we have a government with massive financing problems that is desperately in need of revenue and that may resort to any measure to raise extra revenue, even for a relatively brief period, from people who can ill afford to provide that revenue: namely, students who have largely given up their income earning capacity for a number of years in order to improve their qualifications. Therefore, it is a matter that the coalition feels strongly about. We do not believe that this measure is justified or .appropriate. We believe that the interests of students in this matter need to be defended. We propose to do that by opposing this clause.",17
7,Mr NEVILLE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The higher education contribution scheme, HECS as it is known, is a source of much confusion and concern for both students and parents alike. It has also been a source of embarrassment for the government which, only after much prodding by the coalition, students and community groups, was last year forced to drop the proposed double HECS charge for students studying for a second degree. The bill before us today will, in essence, introduce a pro rata HECS payment which will only add to the confusion and concern. This measure comes on top of the annual indexation which has seen HECS indebtedness for the average full-time course load rise from $1,993 in 1991 to $2,355 in 1994. Not only that but the government, despite the soothing messages in its August 1993 budget and a nominal reduction in the threshold from $27,748 to $26,402, raised the rate of repayment from two, three and four per cent to three, four and five per cent. This amendment bill affects persons leaving full-time education for the first time by calculating the HECS repayment on a pro rata or proportionate basis, depending on their time in the work force. Presently, a HECS debt does not have to be repaid until a yearly income threshold-currently $26,402-has been reached. But, under the government's proposed pro rata system contained in this bill, that threshold will effectively be lowered, as the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) explained in his speech. The measure is clearly unfair, as it is an impost on first-time graduates which will essentially bring forward a payment of $5 million in HECS revenue per year from a group of people who can ill afford it: graduates who are already faced with a very difficult employment environment, the legacy of this government, and who are desperately trying to establish themselves after several years of being students with little or no income. This bill does not take account of the fact that many students after three, four or five years study come out into the work force pretty well strapped for cash, possibly having borrowed off parents and friends to get through that last year. They come out not having a wardrobe to wear to commence work. In many instances, depending on where they get employment, they have to buy a little car. However, the very first thing the government does to them in this first six months of employment-and in most instances that is when HECS will affect these students-is to deprive them of that little bit of income which would get them on their feet. While the collection of HECS by the PAYE system was supported by student bodies at the time of the August budget, and while I respect their view, I have some serious misgivings about PAYE collection. I recognise that on the surface it is a simple mechanism of collection, but I echo the misgiving which the coalition had at the time that it shifts the emphasis of the payment from being a debt to a tax-and therein lies the ability to expand that tax, as the member for Goldstein has pointed out. It is a bit like a hole in the dyke: at this stage it is only a trickle, but it might easily become a flood. There are also some other silly aspects this bill. For example, even a student who paying PAYE tax and has a glitch in his income, perhaps from fruit picking over holidays, will pay a HECS collection paypossible ment. If during the rest of the year he not bring his income up to the $24,602, at end of the year he will subsequently find he has to claim that money back. He is being implications. deprived of the use of that money during the year-again, something that students cannot very easily cope with. I support the honourany able member for Goldstein in this matter. think the whole range of measures brought forward by the government in this bill has been thought through.

8,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Northern TerritoryFor Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories and advocacy Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (10.07 a.m.)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 in accordance with Commonwealth government responsibilities in respect of providing benefits to students within Australian higher education institutions. The bill provides for the continued support of existing student services within Australian higher education institutions through an amendment to the act which will allow the Commonwealth to make payments to student organisations directly and recover funds from the states' general revenue assistance if of necessary. The bill wiIJ also allow the is Commonwealth to make payments to student organisations directly for certain permitted the purposes. The recovery of funds will be under the provision contained in does section 15 of the States Grants (General the Purpose) Bill 1994. This mechanism ensures that that there will be no additional budgetary The provisions contained in the bill will override the provisions of any state law or other action the state may take to the I contrary. The amendment is a direct result of the Tertiary Education (Amendment) Act not 1994 passed by the Victorian government and the actions of the Tasmanian state government towards the University of Tasmania. The Victorian act purports to abolish compulsory student unionism while protecting the provision of specified services to students. While the provisions of this act were being debated in the Legislative Assembly, amendwere made, after considerable pressure from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and the National Union of Students, to increase the range of services funded from non-academic fees. While the Victorian minister may add to the list of approved services by regulation, there is a danger that the list specified by regulation will limit the services and amenities available to students. example, a number of activities and the services such as student newspapers, student and general activities of a representational nature will not be provided for. The Victorian act also places restrictions on the use of profits from activities funded from the compulsory non-academic fees. Whilst the Victorian government has legislated against student organisations, the Tasmanian government has used the Victorian act as a precedent to exert pressure on the University of Tasmania to conform to state government demands. The University of Tasmania has agreed to amend the university ordinances relating to the payment and use of fees for student association membership at the university. All students will continue to pay a compulsory student association fee but students who object to their funds being directed to the Student Representative Council, SRC, will have their fee dedicated to the provision of student services. Traditionally the role of the SRC has been important in meeting a range of non-academic needs of students on campus. The Commonwealth government will challenge the state governments to protect the rights of students. Action taken by the Tasmanian and Victorian governments has the potential to affect the culture and quality of services and amenities at universities. Their intervention is a direct attack on the autonomy of higher education institutions. Institutions and student organisagovernment tions should jointly be able to make decisions about the imposition, collection and use of fees for the provision of services and amenities, independent of government interference. By restricting students' expression of views on public issues, the Victorian government has cynically flouted the international instruments and principles which it had originally claimed to be the basis of its legislative action. Making the expenditure of fees levied by the institution dependent upon state governments' views of what is 'appropriate' effectively amounts to the choking of open debate of government policies as they affect the institution and the student body. The value and need for compulsory student unionism has been endorsed by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and student organisations around Australia. This principle is in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, article 22, concerning freedom of association. Furthermore, most if not all institutions allow for conscientious objection to the membership of student organisations. The Victorian act prohibits the acceptance by universities of financial assistance from the Commonwealth for a student organisation as a result of the state preventing or hindering the imposition or collection of fees, a provision currently contained within section 25A of the act. This amendment to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 will allow the Commonwealth to make payments directly to student organisations for the purpose of enabling those organisations to continue to provide 'benefits' to students and maintain funding support at a viable level. The Commonwealth, through this amendment, will ensure that institutions maintain an environment that fosters the necessary culture and atmosphere for students to exchange ideas and hold and express opinions in a free and unimpeded manner. I commend the bill to the House.",18
9,Dr KEMP,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I rise to speak in opposition to the Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill 1994. This bill represents yet another stage in a four-year battle by the to defend its policy of compulsory student unionism. Over those four years the government has been plagued by its continuing failure to introduce workable legislation which achieves this policy. These failures represent more than poor drafting on the part of the government. They have much more to do with the indefensible nature of the changes it wishes to make and the government's resulting failure to justify them. In 1990 the government introduced the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill which, if enacted, would have allowed the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to compensate student unions for revenues lost as a result of state legislation upholding voluntary membership of those unions. These funds would be paid by the Commonwealth, which in turn would recoup these moneys from the states. After much debate, this bill failed to pass the other chamber and became one of only two pieces of legislation defeated by the parliament in that year. It signified the failure of the government, I have to say, in education and capped off a miserable year for the former Minister for Employment, Educais tion and Training, Mr Dawkins. While the bill was reintroduced and passed in remained an embarrassment for the government, which lacked any mandate from those affected by the bill-that is, the students themselves. The current bill is, in these respects, different from its immediate predecessors. It is part of the confusion and failure which characterises the government's response to issue. Its purpose is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to allow direct payment of funds to universities from the of federal government. This reverses the current situation where funds are passed to universimates. ties on the condition that they will be forwarded to the student unions. This subtle change is a direct response to some clever drafting by the Victorian government in section 12J of its voluntary student unionism legislation which prevents universities from forwarding the funds to student unions. The outcome of this bill has been to estabanyone lish a scheme which penalises state governthese ments for protecting students' freedom to or not to join a student union. The scheme driven by the basest of political motives the self-interest of the government. It is scheme which discriminates between states the basis of their respective policies. 55 lines of statute, the entire shabby approach of the government is fully exposed. Quite decisively, this bill speaks volumes about the lack of principle of the current government. After spending years promoting the flawed cause of compulsory unionism and criticising coalition intentions to dismantle this bill actually stops short of a commitment to that policy. It does not enforce compulsory membership of students, which will soon voluntary in three Australian states, nor does it force students to fund student unions, and by doing so associate themselves with those unions against their will. Given that the government has had some time to take action on its policy of compulsory student unionism, its failure to act is overall effectively the end of the debate. The coalition's long held belief has borne fruit and the intellectual battle has been won. The bill a huge defeat for the government. A decisive victory in the battle against compulsory 1992, it unionism has been struck. This bill is not about compulsory student unionism as such. It is not about enforcing universal membership or promoting student involvement in union affairs. Given that the no Victorian VSU legislation maintains funding to a range of useful student services, it is not even about protecting the provision of serthe vices at universities. This bill results from another concern of this government, not one related to the public interest or to the welfare students. In short, it is about protecting the supply of funds to Labor's student union Ever since unions were formed at universities, political interests have been involved in the running and controlling of these organisations. Over the years, members of both sides of this House have been involved in this process. However, on this side, we have taken the principled stand that neither students nor else should be forced to fund or join unions. The government, however, lacks join the same principle and has chosen through is this bill to introduce a substitute funding and source for unions. When students choose not a to fund the government's mates, this governon ment will come to their aid with taxpayers' In just money. It will bail them out. In practice, this bill allows the government to fund the wages of dozens of members of the Australian Labor Party working in student unions. It will also fund the activities and campaigns run by the National Union of Students to the tune of an estimated $400,000 it, per annum, since the union receives affiliation fees from publicly funded student unions. A repeat of the last federal election will see the be National Union of Students spend $100,000 of these funds on a 'Put the Liberals last' campaign. One can be sure that the officials of the National Union of Students and their Labor predecessors in this parliament will ensure similar spending patterns in the future. While the minister might be satisfied by this outcome, he should not forgot that under this bill he must allocate funding to student unions in response to state reforms in favour of voluntary student unionism. Such political funding does not flow automatically. Instead, it is at the discretion of the minister whether he bestows financial favours upon his mates. We well remember the last minister who used her discretion to allocate Commonwealth money. That minister was the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), who no longer appears on camera behind the government speaker at question time. In her case, two-thirds of the discretionary funding went to either mates or marginal electorates. That was enough to earn her the title of the 'Minister for Sports Rorts', and it forced her to resign in disgrace. In this case a similar kind of accountability is going to arise. Indeed, the allocations of grants under this bill will make the sports rorts affair look timid by comparison. Consider the following: one of the largest student union beneficiaries of the minister's grants would be the Monash University student union, which is geographically located on the border of the minister's Hotham electorate. In line with its 1994 budget, the Monash union could receive a grant for its political activities of more than half a million dollars per annum-that is possibly more than any single grant handed out by Mrs Kelly. The minister might also be pleased to discover that, just last week, two Labor students were elected editors of the student newspaper at Monash University, Lot's Wife. Subject to the vote being declared, they not only will have the potential to influence the votes of the many students residing in Hotham during 1995 but also will each receive wages of more than $l1,OOO-which will most likely be paid by the federal government. The minister might like to explain, in the course of this debate, exactly how he intends to justify such a payment and the dozens of other payments which will result in money going into the hands of his young Labor friends. There is no justification for these potential payments-just excuses. This bill is anathema to all Australians' sense of decency and fairness. I have no doubt that it will result in a massive backlash against the government. The Australian people did not tolerate the original sports rorts episode. They will not tolerate its sequel-a sequel which might be described as 'Unigate', after another incident in which government was caught red-handedly abusing its powers. The political nature of the grants is not the only way in which this bill shows disrespect for all Australians. The fact that the funds transferred to student unions come originally from state funds has severe consequences for taxpayers in those states which decide to uphold student rights. State taxpayers will be forced to fund unions which students refuse to join. As a result, the money available for other state services-hospitals, ambulances, police and schools-will be reduced. This threatens the quality and the availability of services for the residents of the states. In other words, the minister will be proposing to prefer his party mates to the sick, to those who are threatened with violence and to those who are seeking help in a variety of ways from their state government. The minister's priority is clear: money will be taken out of state coffers and given to the Labor Party's friends in the student unions. This is unlikely to be of great concern to the federal government, which continues to squeeze the state's capacity to provide these services in a variety of ways. This bill makes it clear that the government's objective-to fund student unions rather than other state services-is going to be fulfilled at the expense of the rest of the citizens of the states, who seek to guarantee the human rights of students to voluntary association. This bill also represents an intrusion into the democratic processes of the states. At the last Victorian state election, the state coalition committed itself to a policy of voluntary student unionism in its tertiary education and training policy 'Education for Life'. The now Victorian government stated: The Coalition will ensure that compulsory unionism is not forced on students in higher education institutions. This policy, together with others outlined in that campaign, was accepted by a massive majority of the Victorian public. In contrast, this Labor government failed to put any policy on student unionism to the Australian people at the last federal election. This suggests that the government is well aware of the overwhelming opposition of Australians to compulsory unionism and that any move to protect its mates must be made away from the public eye. It also explains why this bill is being introduced well before the government will next face the voters and why we are unlikely to see a budget aIlocating funds under this biIJ anywhere near the time of the next election. This government has quietly sought to override the mandate of a state government by adopting opposing policies which lack electoral approval. This bill also affects the states by forcing their taxpayers to fund, and therefore to indirectly associate with, the political activities of student unionists. The federal government is threatening to subject Victorians, Western Australians and Tasmanians to a form of state sponsored breaching of their freedom of association. Instead of their funds being used to provide services which serve the public interest, taxpayers will be forced to make private grants to assist with the training of politicaIly active student unionists. This wiJI be particularly offensive to students in part-time employment. In many cases, these students will have opted not to join or fund the student union because they cannot make use of any of its activities. However, this bill will force them to contribute financially to those student unions. If indications of student opinion are any guide, a majority of students may be in such a position. In 1993 the Melbourne University student union commissioned Student Services Australia to conduct a poll of students. The majority of students who expressed an opinion indicated support for the concept of freedom of association at tertiary institutions. The repreactivities. sentative nature of this poll was demonstrated another two times in Victoria. Over a period of four days earlier this year, 3,000 first-year university students, constituting 10 per cent all first-year enrollees, signed a petition calling for voluntary unionism in Victoria. That is a significant result, given the resource limitations on the petitioners. In the only referendum on voluntary student unionism in Victoria, the majority of voting students at the Rusden campus of Deakin University supported the state government's legislative moves. Against this background, this bill is a symbol of the lack of respect that the government has for the opinions of young Australians. Not content for them to live their lives according to their own political consciences, this government wiJI decide which political causes warrant the financial support of students. In this case, the training of its political youth movement takes priority. The government's agenda of monopolising public institutions in this country is what matters above all. Another offensive feature of this biIJ is that it rewards the poorest performing student unions the most. Unions whose services are not geared to the needs of students and which suffer a drop in membership as a result wiIJ receive the highest government grants. The danger of this system is immediately apparent. While most sectors of the economy-such as the transport, telecommunications and electricity sectors-are boosting their efficiency and consumer focus, the government is encouraging the opposite within student unions. This biIJ makes a mockery of the government's commitment to principles of competition reform and its accompanying emphasis on efficiency. It protects the monopoly position of student unions, even when a union is failing the students that it is supposed to represent. This legislation threatens to undo 20 years of slow improvement in student unions leading to modern-day voluntary unionism reforms. Under pressure from the prospect of voluntary unionism, compulsory student unions in the late 1980s and in the 1990s moderated to some extent their political They understood, at least in part, that their legitimacy rested on the perception that they were providing services for students. For example, the student union changed of greatly during my 10 years as professor of politics at the Monash University. During that time, in a notable incident, I witnessed the destruction of a student union department designed exclusively to fund marginal offcampus political causes. While student unions could and should perform better, there has been some progress, particularly where radicals have been voted from office. Unfortunately, this bill provides student unions with a positive incentive to tum back the clock to the darker days of the early 1980s. It replaces student accountability with no accountability. The government does not care how much shortfall in revenue the unions experience as a result of decreasing membership and poor performance. The bill provides a blank cheque to failing unions. The government has made it clear that the most successful union is not the one that attracts the most members; it is the one that spends its time delivering partisan political messages rather than providing valuable student services. Membership will become incidental and even irrelevant to a union's pursuit of its objectives. The government is saying to its political mates, 'Play your games. Ignore the interests of students if you wish. We will pick up the tab if students then refuse to join you.' The potential reliance of student unions on government funds has met with mixed reactions within the unions. Many have privately expressed grave concerns about the implications of this legislation on the independence and integrity of their institutions. For instance, will those Labor dominated student unions which oppose the government's changes to HECS or Austudy be able to represent their constituents effectively? The minister's discretion under this bill to make payments or not make payments to these unions could very easily be used as a bargaining chip to ensure the silence of student unions on such matters. Not only would this put the independence of student unions at risk; it could also lead to further student disenchantment with their unions, reductions in membership and ever greater union reliance on the government's payments. This vicious downward cycle, which will doubtless be known as the Crean effect, promises to destroy the very unions which the government claims to be protecting. It will make a mockery of student unions' claims that they represent students and further erode the participation of young Australians in the policy making process. It will be quite clear that a union dependent on a grant given to it at the minister's discretion is representing the government, which is prepared to make these payments to it. In the bill's outline, the minister claims that the state government legislation for voluntary unionism 'amounts to the choking of open debate on government policies as they affect unionism and the institution and the student body'. What a joke! These are prophetic but misguided words. Whereas state governments are introducing freedoms and giving students more independence, the federal government is denying students an effective and independent voice in public affairs. This attack on the autonomy of student organisations and on the rights of students to control their own organisation, to exercise their human rights to join or not join an association and to engage in free debate untrammelled by the aspect of financial pressure from the federal government can be seen as an extension of the federal government's approach to higher education generally. All the rhetoric that we hear from the other side of the House about the autonomy of universities meant absolutely nought when the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, established the national unified system. All universities were brought into the unified system under the administration of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Their autonomy meant nothing to this government. The only time we hear the government defending the autonomy of the universities is when it thinks this phrase can be used as a screen to defend the rights of its student union mates. This is the only occasion we hear the government defending the autonomy of the universities. The autonomy of the states to make their own laws under the democratic actions of the people of those states also means nothing to this government where it believes that it can advance its own political objectives. So the government's claims to be interested in the autonomy of student organisations must be seen for what they are. This bill is one of the most offensive pieces of legislation introduced by the government. It denigrates students who refuse to join a student union by making their decision irrelevant to the operation of the student union. It penalises taxpayers in the states which introduced voluntary student unionism by making them pay for student unions. Ironically, it threatens the viability, independence and integrity of the unions themselves. It puts the minister at risk. I give this advice on the matter to the minister: he should think very carefully about the position which this legislation creates for him. It puts the minister directly in a situation where, through his discretion, he will decide whether hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money will be given to his political mates on campus. It will be his discretion. As I have said, we saw what happened to a minister who decided to allocate large sums of taxpayers' money in the sports rorts affair. This legislation puts the current Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Crean, right up there in the public eye. For these reasons, the coalition will our to ensure that the parliament will scrutinise very closely every grant to student unions made under this legislation. We will give these grants a great deal of publicity as they flow through. These grants overrule the decision of students that they are not prepared to support and fund these organisations. The only thing that remains is for the minister to decide whether he is committed enough to this bill to exercise his discretion. Go ahead, minister. Make our day.",19
10,Mr TANNER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I will resist the urge to say, 'Do you feel lucky, punk?' This legislation relates to an attempt by the federal government to protect organisations that have been targeted by the Liberal and National coalition parties in their state government guise in various parts of this country over a number of years for the precise reason that they have been unable to control those organisations through their own political supporters at university campuses. In effect, what Liberal students and their supporters within Liberal caucuses across the country have been endeavouring to do is destroy what they cannot control. Despite the fact that Labor has been in office for 11 years federally and has done a wide range of things in the higher education area-many of them have been quite controversial and opposed by Labor and left wing students on campusesthe Liberals have still been unable to win any serious support in student union elections across the country. That is the real reason we see voluntary student union legislation being passed by governments such as the Kennett government in Victoria, and that is the real reason the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) has today opposed this legislation. Liberal students have been unable to win support in student union elections across the country for many years. Occasionally, they have an isolated success. But, generally speaking, they do not get support from students. A couple of weeks ago, in equivalent legislation that was also part of the overall package on this issue put forward by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), we heard from the endeavhonourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). It was a rather entertaining contribution. He talked about government money potentially going to fund terrorists overseas. He trotted out some of the more ludicrous myths about the alleged misdemeanours of student unions that have been propagated by Liberal students and their friends in Liberal caucuses over the past 10 or 15 years. To the best of my knowledge, not one example has ever been produced to demonstrate that such events have occurred. In fact, the controversial expenditures of student unions that have been complained about by those on the right have invariably been extremely small and quite innocuous, albeit controversial in terms of their connection with the benefit to students. For example, when these matters were debated at Melbourne University in the late 1970s and were the subject of a court case brought by Robert Clark, who is now a Liberal state member of parliament in Victoria, one of the major items of expenditure up on the block was a grant of $300 to a Marxist feminist conference being held in Sydney. That conference cost roughly 2c per student and was one of the major so-called crimes committed by the Student Representative Council in Melbourne University at that time. These are basically the only serious examples that have ever been produced of alleged misuse of students' money, and they have been struck down in the courts. Robert Clark took the Melbourne University SRC to court and relied upon the provision in the legislation and the constitution of the SRC, which required it to spend money only for the direct benefit of students. Those provisions are virtually uniform across the country so, to the best of my knowledge, all student unions are restrained by those or equivalent words in what they can do: they can spend money only for the direct benefit of students. I am pleased that the honourable member for Goldstein today did not repeat some of the ludicrous nonsense that the honourable member for O'Connor put forward. There is an enormous amount of mythology on this issue and very little substance indeed. Student unions have not funded terrorists. In fact, elections at student unions are almost invariably very heavily contested. They involve candidates from right across the political spectrum. They involve candidates who are not particularly interested in the mainstream political spectrum or even mainstream politics at all. In the 1970s, there were a number of deficiencies in how student unions were structured. For example, the way that delegates were elected to the annual council of the Australian Union of Students was, on many smaller campuses, clearly undemocratic. There was pressure brought to bear; campaigns from the right of the political spectrum within the student movement were ultimately responded to. Those inadequacies were fixed up. Gradually, the student unions did lift their game and some of the features that were common in the 1970s were removed. There is no doubt that elections which now occur are democratically conducted and that there is a supervisory responsibility on the part of the university administration and the university visitor or its equivalent-the institution that is enacted in state legislation to ensure that the conduct of campus affairs is right and proper for people to pursue complaints if there has been some form of electoral misbehaviour or the like. I would like to correct the honourable member for Goldstein on one matter. Although it is obviously a bit out of date, I participated in a referendum at Melbourne University on the question of compulsory student unionism in about 1981. That referendum, with a substantial turnout, voted two to one in favour of compulsory student unionism. There has been a subsequent referendum-I cannot recall the year-which delivered a similar result. It is true that in recent times the only referendum that has occurred on a campus in Victoria has been at Rusden, where the vote for voluntary student unionism was about 280 and the vote against was about 260. This was out of the thousands and thousands of students in Victoria, and was hardly a representative indication of what the student opinion really is. A number of prominent Liberals have launched their careers and, indeed, made their careers on the back of this issue. In the late 1970s, Michael Kroger and the honourable member for Higgins (Mr CostelIo) managed to win a considerable amount of glory in the ranks of the Liberal Party by being seen to take on the evil forces of the ultra Left in the student movement. It is even reported in the media now that they won great victories. This is an extraordinary rewriting of history because, had they won great victories, we would not be debating this bill now. In fact, they did not win great victories. To the best of my knowledge, Michael Kroger never won a serious student election and the honourable member for Higgins won a term or two as the chairperson of the Monash Association of Students. They led an attempt to establish an alternative organisation to the National Union of Students called the National Association of Students, and the honourable member for Higgins was the prime mover in that attempt. From memory, that attempt lasted ahout six months, from 1979 to 1980, and then fizzled. So, in a direct sense, people such as Robert Clark, Michael Kroger and the honourable member for Higgins received a great deal of kudos within the Liberal Party and a good boost for their own careers but, in a practical sense, failed to achieve their objective, which was to destroy compulsory student unionism. Of course, they are still pursuing that objective with an equivalent amount of success. The Victorian legislation is nothing like voluntary student unionism. The first draft of the Kennett legislation provided for a compulsory fee still to be levied on students by universities to provide for non-academic services but for there no longer to be any form of membership or rights associated with membership. Therefore, students were going to be subject to a form of taxation without representation. The university would still levy a fee to cover a wide range of non-academic activities and the students would lose the right to elect their own representatives to control the expenditure of that fee. We had a wide range of absurdities built into the legislative structure. Sport would continue to be compulsorily funded but culture and theatre would not. Universities would have to tender out services, so not only would students be denied the right to elect representatives to control the money that they were contributing but universities would have to tender out services and student unions would be artificially hampered in their ability to compete in those tenders. A wide range of cultural activities in which university campuses have been the crucible of Australian talent-such as the arts, theatre, comedy and music-would be excluded whereas, as I said, sport would not be excluded. There was an enormous protest against this, predominantly from people who are not involved in politics but who are amongst the most prominent in Australian art, theatre, music and the like. This included such notables as Steve Vizard, who I understand is being touted as one of the many possibilities for the seat of Kooyong and whose potential candidacy has been made to appear quite respectable by some of the other candidates who have started to surface. So there have been substantial protests against the initial legislation. The Kennett government then had a bit of a change of heart and reviewed it even further. The amended legislation now allows for the compulsory funding of cultural activities. The main things that now can no longer be funded by compulsory fees are clubs and societies and student newspapers. We have the absurd situation where the debating society at Melbourne University can still be funded via compulsorily levied student fees but other cultural societies cannot. The overseas student service advocacy functions can still be funded by compulsory fees-including from people who are not overseas studentswhereas other advocacy services cannot. Student radio and television can be funded by compulsory fees but student newspapers cannot. So we have a situation where, in practice, the great assault on compulsory student unionism that the Victorian Liberal government has entered into is, in fact, nothing of the sort. What in effect it has chosen to do is sustain those parts of non-academic campus activities which are funded by the student levy, to sustain those parts to which it does not really object-which is about 90 to 95 per cent of the total of student union activityand to target directly the bits that it does object to. Why does it object to them? Because, more often than not, those forms of activity involve political expression which is contrary to the position of the Liberal Partynot always, but more often than not. So we now have the absurd situation where we have these great defenders of freedom, these great supporters of freedom of association out there in the public domain saying, 'Well, yes, we support freedom of association and the right to choose. At the moment, you have to pay $300 or $350 for non-academic purposes to join the Melbourne University student union which provides the services. We are going to relieve you of this incredible burden. We'll still slug you for the fee and we'll still have that money being spent for almost all of the same services, but you will lose your right to decide through your elected representatives how that fee is going to be spent. We will have a situation where there is no structure of membership for the student union related to that fee.' So, in effect, you end up with the worse of both worlds. I notice that the honourable member for Goldstein did not say very much about the Victorian legislation. If he is honest I think he would be embarrassed by it because it is a million miles away from voluntary student unionism. It is a quarter-way house which is designed to extract the bits of student union activity that the Liberal Party objects to for political reasons and to hit them-for example, student newspapers. Many people have made much of the analogy with trade unions in this debate. Student unions have some similarity with trade unions, but not many. I am in a reasonable position to know. I have worked in student unions and I have been a trade union official. The advocacy role representing the broad interests of members certainly bears a similarity. But equally student unions have a lot in common with local government because, like local government, student unions exist to serve a defined constituency. A student union at Melbourne University serves a larger constituency than some of the recently abolished local councils. It serves a larger constituency than some councils that will continue to be in existence in rural areas in Victoria. They provide, in many respects, similar services to local government-perhaps not the same making of roads, collecting of rubbish and so forth, but a variety of other services that are all part of providing localised services to assist a specifically defined community. I pay rates like, presumably, the bulk of everybody else in this place. At the moment I do not use my local swimming pool very much. There are a variety of other things in my local municipality that I do not use at all, yet I am helping to pay for them. The argument that I should not have to do that, that I should be able to opt out, that I should be able to voluntarily seek not to participate in my local municipality, is roughly equivalent to the argument that I should be able to go to Melbourne University yet not participate in the provision of services of a broad nature, of a non-academic nature, on that campus. Sure, student unions are not precisely the same as local government, but I would suggest that they bear as much resemblance to local government as they do to trade unions. The argument of freedom of association that we have heard is hypocritical nonsense. Student unions are, in effect, an integral part of campuses of universities-institutions to which admission is voluntary. Nobody in Australia is forced to go to a university. It is a bit like saying that you are compulsorily required to join the department of history if you want to study history at Melbourne University. We have a recent opinion from Alan Goldberg QC advising that the current arrangements with respect to so-called compulsory student unionism do not breach international law with respect to freedom of association-the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights freedom of association provisions. We might well ask: who is this Alan Goldberg? Some left wing lawyer who used to be a student union official? No, he is not. Alan Goldberg, much to the interest of the media, I suspect, if the media knew about it, was the person who won the Dollar Sweets case. He was the person whose bags were carried by the honourable member for Higgins and whose success in that case has been lived off by the honourable member for Higgins ever since. He was the person who was out there defending, supposedly, the rights of small employers against unionists-hardly somebody who would approach an issue of this nature with great bias. He has also been the president of the Victorian Council of Civil Liberties. So it is an opinion, I would suggest to those on the other side, that should be treated with some respect. I turn now to some of the comments that the honourable member for Goldstein made. I found it amusing that he defines this legislation put forward by the government as a victory for voluntary student unionism. Maybe he is one of the small group in the Liberal Party who think they won the 1993 election or some of the others who think that Alexander Downer is doing a great job and that his poll levels at the moment are really good. It is an interesting new concept of victory. He also complained about the National Union of Students contributing funds to election campaign activity last year. That has not been typical. There have been some elections where the National Union of Students or its equivalent predecessor, the Australian Union of Students, contributed little or nothing in election campaign activity. We might well ask: why did the National Union of Students put in so much effort last year? The answer is the education policy that the honourable member for Goldstein was responsible for. He was the reason. Because he put forward the most extreme, the most inequitable, the most favourable to the rich education policy that has been seen in higher education debate in this country for many years, the National Union of Students got very active in that election campaign. So if the honourable member for Goldstein wants to complain about that perhaps he should look at his own policies because they were what triggered the involvement of the National Union of Students. In the past the National Union of Students and AUS before it have been extremely critical of Labor governments and have campaigned against them on issues like HECS, amalgamations and the like. I noted also his interesting comments about the notion of the mandate. The Liberal Party are pretty funny on this notion of the mandate. When it is a Labor government that has a long, detailed set of policies and there is a particular policy that it is seeking to implement which has not been a highlighted issue in the election campaign, the Liberal Party says, 'No, you have not got a mandate to do that.' The Whitlam government had numerous items of legislation rejected or threatened in the Senate, national compensation and national superannuation, for example, which were part of the platform it went to the electorate with in 1972 and 1974. According to the Liberal Party that was not a mandate. But when we had an issue which was completely inconsequential in the election campaign in 1992 in Victoria, the Kennett government had a mandate for that. The Kennett government also had a mandate that no worker would be worse off in Victoria. Subsequent events have started to illustrate what that mandate means for them. What we are dealing with here is essentially a politically motivated debate. The Liberal Party has been unable to control student unions. Student unions are a source of dissent the to governments like the Kennett government. They are a source of dissent to the types of policies that people like the honourable member for Goldstein would like to impose on the Australian people and on higher education. They want to stifle that dissent. That is the motivation behind their position on these issues. That is the reason why they oppose this legislation. That is the reason why governments like the Kennett government are putting such bizarre legislation into place. It is to stifle dissent on campuses. (Time expired)",24
11,Mr CAMERON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Stirling) (10.57 a.m.)The hypocrisy of those opposite never ceases to amaze me. Here we have another example of the federal Labor government doing all it can to impose its will on the states and to legislate when it can to override the states when the states have introduced legislation which is anathema to the beliefs of the Labor Party. Given that all but one state has a coalition government in this country, I will bet my sweet bippy that we are going to see this Labor government continue in every way that it can to impose its will on the states. This bill is but another example of this. Prior to the last state election the Western Australian state coalition made it perfectly clear that it would introduce legislation to make membership of student unions voluntary. That legislation was introduced last year amid threats from then education Minister Beazley that if the Western Australian education minister went ahead with his proposed legislation the federal government would introduce legislation penal ising the states the equivalent amount to that lost by student guilds who lost income caused by voluntary membership to student unions. The threats made by Minister Beazley, which have since been carried out, are anathema to democracy and are pure and simple standover tactics by a minister not unfamiliar with such tactics. This bill amends the Higher Education Funding Act to make provision for Commonwealth grants to student unions for circumstances where a state government takes action to implement voluntary student unionism and the student union loses members as a result and therefore loses income. The states grants bill recently passed in this place provides for the Commonwealth to recoup any moneys paid for this purpose from the states general purposes grants. I must say how ironic it is that the federal Labor Party is claiming that it is overriding the Tasmanian government's homosexual laws under the banner of providing freedom of choice for individuals but, when a state government does likewise for tertiary students who are old enough and smart enough to make decisions for themselves, the feds override those states by saying students do not deserve free choice. This bill, in conjunction with the states grants bill, is aimed at forcing Australian taxpayers to fund student services and activities which students do not wish to fund themselves. I will make a number of points on this, but the basic fact is that membership to any organisation, including student unions, should be voluntary. Secondly, the education policy of the Western Australian coalition-I realise that this legislation will impact on other states, as a Western Australian I have a vested interest in the impact it has on my own state-released well before the last state election, states unequivocally that a coalition government would make membership of student guilds voluntary. The Western Australian government therefore has a mandate to introduce its legislation without any threats, standover tactics or overriding by the federal government. In overriding the Western Australian legislation, the Labor government is undermining the will of the people of Western Australia, who endorsed the coalition and its policies, including its promise to bring in voluntary student unionism. The Victorian and Tasmanian governments made similar commitments prior to their elections and also have a similar mandate to introduce their legislation. Thirdly, Australian taxpayers should not be paying for student political activities which students have deliberately chosen not to pay for themselves. If students deem the activities of the student union to be unworthy of their support, it is wrong for the federal government to legislate for the Australian taxpayer to fund those activities which students have deliberately chosen not to fund. Finally, we have before us legislation which does not actually specify how much money, if the bill is eventually passed, this will cost the taxpayer. It could be $3 million; it could be $20 million. We do not know; the government does not know. Whatever it costs, that· will be lost by the relevant states in states grants. Consequently, those states will lose out on roads, schools, hospitals and other more essential services. Irrespective of how the Labor Party describes this biII, the thrust of this legislation coupled with the states grants bill is to punish states for providing freedom of choice for students. In the event of states providing students with the basic right to make decisions for themselves, the federal government has introduced this legislation to guarantee the income of student guilds at the expense of essential services to the relevant states. While the state governments of Victoria, Tasmania and, of course, Western Australia but are trying to enshrine the freedom of the individual in legislation by providing for freedom of association at our universities, the Labor Party is implicit in its intentions to restrict the freedom of students by forcing students to join the guild. If the Labor Party could have its way, it would have students who chose not to join their student union kicked out of the university. I understand that each of the governments in the three states I have mentioned has introduced a different form of voluntary membership. Victoria has outlawed a compulsory fee for political activities but has maintained a compulsory amenities fee to cover such things as food, child care and cultural activities. The Western Australian government makes membership completely voluntary and the Tasmanian government has come to an agreement with its university whereby students must pay a set compulsory fee, but the student may choose whether to pay all of this to student services or direct some to the political activities of the union. Irrespective of the format of their legislation, the states all provide voluntary membership in particular to the political activities of the student unions. It is not up to the federal government to interfere in the decisions of what are the states responsibilities and ride roughshod over the states and the decisions they make and which they have a mandate to make. There is no denying that the Labor Party uses student unions as a training ground. Over the years we have seen many former guild presidents end up in this place or in cushy positions in the trade union movement or the Labor Party. Even in this parliament there are many members opposite who carried out their political apprenticeship in a student union or guild. The federal government is introducing this legislation to protect its training ground and it is using taxpayers' money to train its future movers and shakers. By protecting the student unions, the Labor government is ensuring taxpayers' funds are used to promote its own cause. In relation to levels of corruption, this is more blatant and therefore worse than the misuse of funds we saw in the sports rorts affairs under the then minister for the environment, sport and territories. I add that it is not just the political activiStudents, ties that are offensive to many students. Student guilds have had no trouble in offending other groups. I cite some examples. A few years ago the student newspaper at Curtin University in Western Australia, Grok, published a number of what it called jokes which were plainly sick and most offensive to spastics, those with Down Syndrome and disabled people. I notice that it received the condemnation of the then state education minister, Dr Carmen Lawrence. I have some examples from that particular publication which are too offensive to repeat in this House today, but if anyone would like to view them privately they can be sickened in private. Students at Curtin University were being forced to pay for a publication which printed trash like this and we have the government arguing that these are essential services for students. What complete and utter rot. Students at universities are intelligent people. They are future business and government leaders and they can make decisions for themselves. If they choose not to join a student union which authorised trash like this, that is their right. It is not up to the federal government to give student unions money which they lost through being unable to attract membership. The second example comes from the front page of the April edition of the Edith Cowan University newspaper, Harambee, which features a sexually grotesque effigy of Christ. The paper features articles which to many students were blasphemous and satanic. This edition was of great offence to many Christians on the Edith Cowan campus and it was reported in Western Australia this week that copies of this particularly offensive, trashy paper have been distributed in Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Malaysia. What a great advertisement for our universities trying to attract foreign students. People might argue in both these cases that the editors of the student trash are entitled to freedom of speech, but that should only be available if students can similarly choose not to fund the publication of things like this. despite being totally opposed to the content of these publications, were forced to fund them and no students could register their protest against the publication by withdrawing their membership of the student union. If they did, they were threatened with expulsion from the university. Now that certain state governments have rectified that situation, the federal government, knowing that student unions are so unrepresentative they cannot attract members, have introduced this legislation to guarantee the income of the student unions. This bill ensures that student unions remain unrepresentative, politically partisan and unattractive to join. With a guaranteed income, there is no way the unions will act in students' interests. They will simply continue to act in the interests of the union executive, who more often than not are fulfilling their Labor Party apprenticeships. The final example concerns a motion of the Murdoch University Guild of Students secretariat meeting held on 22 November 1990. The motion, which was passed, reads: That the Murdoch University Guild of Students encourage Secretariat members to attend meetings under the influence of consciousness-raising drugs, intoxicating substances, nicotine induced inspiration and non-prescription ideology. Here we have an example of a motion that was passed encouraging student representatives, paid by compulsorily acquired guild fees, to attend meetings in drunken stupors, stoned out of their minds and unbecoming of students who are meant to be representatives of the whole student population. It is a farce that this legislation uses taxpayers' money to fund activities which students themselves choose not to fund when the activities of the guild are of a non-student, immature, unrepresentative and totally wasteful manner. Why should students or taxpayers be forced to fund student guilds when the activities of those guilds, such as those I have just talked about, are clearly not in the student interest and in fact impugn the image of the students? The same scenario exists on a political level. Student unions throughout the nation have never been backward in coming forward when it comes to defending the Labor Party. The Labor Party has hijacked the student union movement because it gives it control of millions upon millions of compulsorily acquired dollars with which it can distribute its propaganda to an audience of hundreds of thousands of university students. As I say, neither students nor taxpayers should be forced to fund such activities when they are blatantly politically partisan. Most university student unions and guilds are affiliated to the National Union of Students, a body which, again, is stacked by Labor stooges. Its job is to protect and defend the ALP on campuses around the country. This bill guarantees its income and ensures that the situation remains. The National Union of Students at the 1990 federal election and the 1993 federal election was blatant in its support of the ALP. Indeed, I read an excerpt from the minutes of a National Union of Students national executive meeting of 15 February 1993. Motion E2-93-4 states: That the executive authorise the president to conduct a 'Put the Liberals Last' campaign for the federal election and that up to $30,000 be committed by the union for his campaign. The motion was carried without amendment. Here we have the Labor Party's purpose with this bill being exposed for what it is. This bill guarantees the income of student unions, including the National Union of Students. When we see the pro-Labor motions like that,. passed at the NUS executive meeting, we are hardly surprised that the Labor Party wants to protect its income, even though it is at great cost to the schools, hospitals and other essential services of states which dare to allow students to make decisions for themselves. This is a corrupt bill. Like the sports rorts affair and the massive grants to Labor's mates in the trade union movement, this bill steals money off taxpayers and gives it to student unions which, at the end of the day, are using the money for anti-Liberal and pro-Labor purposes. It cares little for the rights of students. It ignores the fact that the states have a mandate to introduce voluntary student unionism. It cares little for the people of the states who will have less funding for roads, schools and hospitals, which is from where the money will be redirected to pay for the student political activity; and, finally, it ignores the fact that the vast majority of students care little for their student union. Students are old enough and intelligent enough to make decisions for themselves. The legislation of the relevant state governments provides for students to make their own decisions, including whether or not they shall join their campus student union. The legislation of the states was intended to make the student unions accountable and answerable to the student population. The legislation was designed to make student unions representative, hard working, attractive and worth joining. If the unions were none of these, students would not have joined. This legislation, by guaranteeing their income, allows student unions to ignore their members, knowing full well that even if they tum members off and lose them they will not lose a cent of funding. We could have a situation where a student union could give half its money to the League of Rights and it would not lose a cent of income from students withdrawing their membership. That is a complete and utter farce. While this bill does not restrict students' abilities to make their own decisions, if students choose not to join their student union, for whatever reason, the government pays the shortfall and the relevant states lose the equivalent of what the government pays in lieu of students not joining the student union. For example, if a student decides not to join a student union because they do not use any of the outlets provided by the union or the guild, and they oppose the political activities of the union, then the union will not suffer. Student unions will not be forced to change their ways to attract members. They will not be forced to alter their policies to encompass the attitudes of all students. They will simply take money which should have gone to their states' essential services and waste it on their blatant political partisan activities. This bill legislates for Labor to rip off taxpayers' money from the states to fund the political activities of student unions. It is a ridiculous bill. I reiterate my opposition Labor Party overriding the powers of the states to legislate in this area where the states have the right to legislate. I condemn the Labor Party for introducing this bill. I encourage the Western Australian Greens to bear in mind the interests of Western Australia's hospitals, police force, schools and roads before voting on this bill. I urge them to vote for Western Australia's rights and prevent the Labor Party's undermining of the rights of the states to legislate where it has responsibility. How the members opposite can legislate for corruption and theft, which is what this bill essentially does, is bewildering, disappointing and, ultimately, despicable.",28
12,Mr CLEELAND,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"MCEwen) (11.13 a.m.)What rubbish! What an appalling, abysmal example of a person who purports to be a member of this House and who purports to represent the interests of students in this country. His speech was appalling, hypocritical and illogical. Let us have a look at what the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) was basically saying. He was saying that people have the right to free association, provided they agree with the Liberal Party. In his speech he gave the reason for the opposition to this bill: the Liberal and National parties have never been able to get control of any of the student guilds on any campus. Because students will always voice their point of view publicly, and often very well, and because they are primarily opposed to the nonsense that the opposition comes up with, the opposition wants to get rid of student guilds. That is why the Victorian government tried to abolish student guilds in Victorian tertiary institutions. The evidence is very clear. For example, a Victorian Liberal Party education policy committee has stated on the record: We do not want compulsory student moneys flowing out to anti-Kennett and anti-coalition campaigns and other fringe activities of the hard student left. A spokesman for the Victorian education minister, Mr Haddon Storey, has said: . .. the legislation was not intended to affect ""genuine"" services, but to curtail compulsory to the funding for political activities ... I wonder what members of the Liberal Party and National Party opposite would say if the majority of students on Australian tertiary campuses supported the Liberal Party. Would we see such legislation in Western Australia and Victoria if they believed there was political advantage in having those guilds? Of course we would not. That is the sheer hypocrisy of what people in the opposition parties are saying here today. How can one come to grips with the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) when he talks about freedom of the individual but then says that because he disagrees with what student newspapers print they should be censored? So freedom of the individual to join an association is somehow different from freedom of expression. Why is that so? I do not always agree with what student universities print. In my years as a student at Monash University I certainly did not agree s with Lot Wife on very many occasions. Maybe it was because I was a mature age student and I had a different sense of humour from those younger than I. I often found Lot s Wife to be somewhat puerile and childish in its approach to issues. That might well be my view, but it does not mean that I want to stand in this place and say to students in any university that they should or should not publish something, even if they do offend people in the process. We heard a lot of nonsense about states rights, and it is nonsense. Who do you think pays the bills for tertiary education in AustralThey is-the states? Of course they do not. The Australian government foots the bill for tertiary education in Australia, not the state governments-to their eternal shame, I might add. All the Liberal-National Party state governments in Australia are doing at the moment is cutting funding for education whilst the Labor Party in national government is increasing funding for education.",32
13,Mr COBB,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"That's wrong, absolutely wrong.",33
14,Mr CLEELAND,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Absolutely wrong, the honourable member says. Let us have a look at today's Age. The headline on the front page says 'Education: warning of blowout'. Eight thousand teachers have been sacked from the Victorian education system. There are classroom sizes of over 35. In rural schools in Victoria-the honourable member should listen to this-there are no psychologists, hearing or sight specialists or special teachers for reading difficulties. Rural schools in Victoria cannot get them any more. They cannot get integration aids. Eleven rural schools have been closed within my federal boundaries. And you are not concerned as a National Party member? You should go and talk to your National Party colleagues in Victoria and hear what they are saying about your party in government in Victoria. You should go and talk to Mr Hill, for example, who was the campaign  MCNamara. He lives in Warrenbayne, near BenalIa, in Victoria. He is on the school council of the Warrenbayne Primary School. Mr Hill has resigned from the National Party and has clearly told the National Party what he thinks of its education policies-the sorts of policies you would put in if you ever get onto the front benches of this House. Let us not talk nonsense about states rights on this issue. It is nonsense. If the states funded the institutions I might give some credence to the argument, but they do not. The reality is that the legislation Victoria introduced had nothing to do with controlling so-calIed unionism because student guilds are. not unions. They are caIled unions as a coIlective entity, but they are not unions. do not come under the Industrial Relations Act. They do not get involved with awards and wages conditions. By any stretch of the imagination we cannot call them unions in the normal sense of the word. So let us not get carried away by unions. They are coIlective organisations compulsorily funded for a wide range of student union campus activities, including debating, social clubs, child care and similar facilities, and student newspapers. If there happen to be on campus Labor Party clubs, democratic liberal clubs, Liberal clubs, National Party clubs-though there are very few of those on campus, but certainly there are Liberal Party clubs-and they happen to be funded in the process, so what? I would have thought it would be more desirable to have our tertiary students involved in the political activities on campus as part of the democratic processes of this country than to try to deny that right. I would have thought that was a very desirable thing to do, but obviously the coalition does not think that. Let us knock on the head the belief that this legislation is somehow a Labor Party initiative. Let us knock on the head once and for all the view that the opposition keeps putting in this place that this is purely to keep Labor's political mates on campus on side. What does the Australian Vice-ChanceIlors Committee and in particular the ViceChanceIlor of Melbourne University, Professor David Penington, say about the Victorian legislation? Is anyone on the opposition side going to suggest that David Penington is a supporter of the Labor Party? I would certainly like to hear someone from the coalition suggest that he supports the Australian Labor Party, because I can tell you he does not. What did David Penington state? 'Absolutely crazy.' The stated position of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee on the Victorian and Western Australian legislation is: It is the prerogative of universities to determine conditions of enrolment. The Vice-Chancellors have stated ... that student organisations not only provide essential services and facilities but also are an important element in the social and cultural aspects of universities and are part of the education process ... In addition to catering for the welfare of students while they are enrolled at University, student organisations encourage a broad range of activities by funding diverse groups ranging from religious societies to faculty associations to debating clubs. Participation in these activities is tional in the broadest of sensesI say again, 'educational in the broadest of senses'encouraging students to develop their social skills. Student organisations also promote a wide range of sporting activities and provide for the student community. It is essential that the student organisations continue to contribute to the ethos of universities in this way. To do so however, they must have adequate funds at their disposal. Shortly after the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee issued that statement Professor Penington attacked the Victorian government over the legislation. Professor Penington called it intrusive, absurd, and said it undermined university cultural life and autonomy. In typical Kennett fashion the Victorian government refused to consult and refused to agree. We get used to that down there-what Kennett says goes; there is a one man government in Victoria. After an amazing amount of pressure-not from Labor Party people, I might add-the Victorian government made a minor amendment to the legislation. But it still does not tackle the criticisms of the vice-chancellors and it still does not bring back in the sorts of activities which students rightly expect and should have on our campuses not just in Victoria but throughout Australia. The member for Stirling made some comments about the lack of interest of students in these organisations. Around 80 per cent of Australian public universities are affiliated with the National Union of Students, representing about 400,000 of the 575,000 students attending higher education institutions. Affiliation is consequent upon a majority vote in three-day referenda on the constituent campuses. Did you hear that? Referenda. Vote. The students voted to belong to the National Union of Students. On the one hand we are being told that this compulsion is not desired, that it is antidemocratic, yet on the other hand the opposition would remove the financial capacity of students to be involved in those democratic processes. It is illogical. It is hypocritical. It is the sort of nonsense we expect daily from this rather battered and tattered group of educa- people who call themselves democrats. We do not expect them, frankly, to change. This legislation is desirable. It is supported by vice-chancellors of all Australian tertiary institutions-people who are not naturally friends of the Australian Labor Party moverecreational facilities ment. Let me get back to a comment that the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) made in his contribution. He accused us of looking after the political mates of the government on campus. Let us have a look at what the Liberal-National Party does about political mates. What about Mr Williams, the chairman of Tabcorp, with the $8 million package of public funds in Victoria? What about Centor, a public company in Victoria, which without tender, in breach of tender guidelines in Victoria, got the job to control the float of Tabcorp and was paid $4 million? Let us look at the Melbourne Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Market Trust. It comprised representative groups who used the market-growers, wholesalers, a union representative and myself, as chairperson, as a lawyer. It was a broadly based management body. The Melbourne Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Market Trust is the largest wholesale market in Australia. Mr Kennett came along and sacked the entire trust. Three people, non representative of any user group on the Melbourne Wholesale Fruit and Vege table Market Trust, got jobs insteadKennett's mates. Moira Rayner dared to criticise the VictoriIf an government, dared to be different. What happened to Moira? She got the sack. You want to talk about political mates. I am more than happy to stand in this place and talk about political mates. The opposition wants to accuse us of having political mates. What about the treasurer of the Liberal Party who, when facing criminal charges, found it quite easy to write to the Victorian Attorney-General asking him to intervene with the DPP of Victoria and stop the criminal charges? Political mates? Yes, indeed. Victoria is rampant with political mates bleeding off the body politic with their pockets getting full of cash. If the member for Goldstein wants to come in here and talk about political mates, I am more than happy to join him in debate. I have already said that the opposition is being hypocritical, and indeed it is. This government has a very proud record on education. If it is to be contrasted with the National and Liberal parties' views and actions on education in this country, our record stands unique. We have increased education funding at the national level every year we have been in government. Beyond doubt we have improved the educational base in Australia. More students, as a percentage, now stay on in secondary colleges and attend tertiary institutions than ever before in Australia's history. When I look at my own state and at the secret agenda of the National and Liberal parties in The Things That Matter, I find the same sort of policy being put by them as Jeff Kennett ran with in Victoria. In Victoria the application of these Liberal and National Party policies is very simple-you close schools, cut 8,000 teachers, increase classroom sizes; you destroy the base of education. We are not about that. This bill is not about that; this bill is about giving power to students. If we are really talking about freedom of choice in this debate, as some coalition members have, then we are waiting to find out what the opposition is going to say about freedom of choice of sexual activity in the bedroom between consenting adults. We will test the opposition on the freedom of choice. opposition members believe that freedom of choice is important-both opposition speakers so far have raised freedom of choice-we will test them. We will see what they do when the government introduces a bill into this House which will give consenting adults sexual choice in the privacy of their bedrooms. That is the challenge. There is no use talking about freedom of choice in this sort of legislation. I challenge opposition members in this debate to come into this House and vote on that issue.",33
15,Ms WORTH,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Adelaide) (11.30 a.m.)Since I was elected to this House in March 1993, few pieces of government legislation have struck me as being as cynical as the legislation we are debating today. Many pieces have struck me as lacking in common sense-indeed, many of the government's legislative efforts have struck me as being hopelessly misguided-but few have struck me as being as cynical, as calculated to win votes, regardless of the costs, as the Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill being debated today. Let there be no mistake: this bill represents a cynical political manoeuvre. It is framed to serve the government's interests, not student interests, and no amount of government rhetoric can disguise this fact. This bill will put in place a mechanism which allows the Commonwealth government to directly fund student unions in those states where student union membership has been made voluntary. What an extraordinary act of generosity! It is an extraordinary act of generosity because this bill could potentially translate into Commonwealth government outlays of many millions of dollars. I have not heard members of the government talk about the potential dimensions of its generosity. Perhaps they have been overcome by modesty. Stranger things have happened. It could fall to the coalition to do so for them. Let us look at how much money the Commonwealth government may be up for in the case of a single university that is affected by VSU legislation. Even making the conservative assumption that the university in question has about 20,000 students, and assuming that this university has previously charged a student union membership fee of $200-again, this is a conservative figurethe Commonwealth could potentially be obliged to direct up to $4 million to the university's student union. As I have said, $4 million to a single student union is extraordinarily generous. While I am in awe of the government's generosity, may I ask where this money is coming from? My apologies if this question makes the government a little uncomfortable. How does the government intend to fund its generosity? In fact, the money the government intends to give to student unions will simply be recovered from the grants paid to state governments-grants that, in part, are used by state governments to provide funding to universities. And herein lies the gross cynicism of this bill. The money that the Labor government will give to student unions will be taken from Commonwealth grants to the states. The states provide funds to universities, despite what has been said by the previous speaker, the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland). In my own state of South Australia, the state government provides in excess of $2 million to our three universities. Clearly, a state's ability to maintain this funding will be significantly limited when the Commonwealth government deducts student union running costs from general purpose grants to the states. Ultimately, the funds the Commonwealth government will so generously be providing to student unions will reduce the amount of funds that state governments can direct to universities-funds that universities rely on to maintain their services to students. Essentially, the government is redirecting funds from universities to student unions, and the standard of education that students receive will suffer accordingly. If this government were truly committed to the welfare of students, it would not be introducing legislation which will ultimately reduce the level of government funding received by universities, and it would certainly not be doing so at a time when universities are in a state of crisis from inadequate funding. Despite what the previous speaker had to say, the university system under Labor has undergone a massive upheaval. The number of students in higher education leapt by 64 per cent in the 10 years between 1982 and 1992. In itself, the opening up of universities to more Australians was a good thing. However, unaccompanied by any real Commonwealth government commitment to maintaining educational standards, it has been a disaster. During 10 years of Labor rule, funding per full-time student has dropped by 15.2 per cent-a dramatic decline in funding that has created a state of crisis in our university system. As a consequence of Labor's lack of vision, student-staff ratios have increased to the point where tutorials now resemble mini-lectures rather than the personalised discussions that they are meant to be. Student services such as libraries and study skills courses are being continually cut back. Students are being asked to pay additional fees. In my electorate, science students at the University of Adelaide are being asked to pay IOc for every glass slide that they use in the course of their studies. Last year, the Adelaide university was forced to raise $400,000 from students in this way. Australian universities are already struggling to maintain their standards, and they cannot afford this legislation. The funding they will lose when the Commonwealth government redirects state grants towards student unions will simply exacerbate the already critical funding situation. Surely this begs the question: if the government is so concerned about the welfare of Australian university students, why has it drafted a piece of legislation that will further reduce the level of funding received by Australia's cash strapped universities? Why has it drafted a piece of legislation that will potentially result in worse student-teacher ratio numbers, fewer student services and more fees? Does it have anything to do with the fact that voluntary student unionism jeopardises the future of the National Union of Students, a union which had sufficient funds to run a $100,000 campaign during the last election-a campaign with the pro-Labor message of 'Put the coalition last'? As I have said, I have rarely seen such cynical legislation. This legislation is to be condemned on many grounds. The manner in which this legislation invades an area of state responsibility is one such ground. Whatever the relative merits of voluntary and compulsory student unionism, the Commonwealth has no right to intervene in what is an area of state responsibility. The question of whether student union fees are to be paid as a condition of enrolment is a question relating to the governance of universities. Since universities are organisations incorporated under state acts of parliament, the Commonwealth has no business interfering in their operations. The way in which they operate is a matter for the state governments, and the issue of voluntary student unionism is to be decided by each state separately. For the Commonwealth to interfere in what is clearly an area of state responsibility is to fly in the face of the spirit of our federal system of government-a system that exists to check the rise of centralised power, a system that Labor seems to have little respect for. It is up to each state and every state government to address the issue of VSU individually. Victoria has implemented VSU legislation, after taking this policy to the Victorian people at the last state election. Victorians made a decision that compulsory student unionism had to be reformed within their state and, in consequence, students at universities in Victoria now voluntarily join their student union. In my own state of South Australia, a state which was bankrupted under Labor, the Liberal state government has listened to the people of South Australia and has found that there is no mandate for VSU legislation. It is right for South Australia to come to that decision. The issue of VSU is not a matter to be decided by federal parliamentarians, and this legislation should not pass through this parliament for that reason. Since the issue of VSU is not a matter for federal parliamentarians, it is not for me to say whether I support or oppose VSU. However, I have no hesitation in saying that I believe student unions are an essential part of student university life. Although it will no doubt upset members opposite, I have regular contact with the student representatives in my own electorate, and I think it has been a productive relationship. For my part, I certainly appreciate the access to student concerns that the relationship provides. Having benefited from my contact with student unions, I am particularly concerned about the impact that this bill will have on the autonomy and, ultimately, the integrity of these organisations. In states which have VSU legislation in place, the independence of student unions is not threatened. Although Labor is given to peddling the simplistic view that VSU legislation is designed to destroy student unions, in reality this could not be further from the truth. Under VSU legislation, there is the potential for student unions to be re-energised by a membership which is no longer forced to join but which has chosen to join. On the other hand, the future for a student union which acquires its funds from the Commonwealth is grim. Ideally, a union has no allegiance other than to its membership. Thus, a union defends its members' interests against any and alI who threaten those interests. At times, and I suggest we are now in one of those times, students' interests may be threatened by the Commonwealth government. If a student union receives its funding from the Commonwealth government, can it realistically be expected to criticise the government? Of course not. You do not bite the hand that feeds you. The Labor government's legislation will have a far more destructive impact on student unions than any pro-VSU state government could come up with. With this legislation, Labor will ensure that student unions will be in the pocket of the Commonwealth government of the day. I understand that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has given assurances to student unions that any funding they will receive will be untied. If I were a member of a student union, I would be feeling just a little nervous about that particular promise. This legislation is unusualIy loose. Decisions about whether a union receives Commonwealth funding are largely up to the discretion of the minister, and they are reviewable. I cannot help but wonder how the minister might apply his discretion if he realised the money he would be providing to student unions was soon to be used to run a 'put Labor last' campaign during the next election. I would suggest that the instincts for survival might come into play. Not only will the autonomy of student unions be jeopardised by this legislation; at the same time the membership of those unions will be decimated. The government's legislation would put in place very solid disincentives for students at universities affected by VSU legislation to pay membership fees to a union. Obviously, if you are a young student struggling to find money to pay for textbooks, you will not take up membership of a student union if you know that without your membership fee your union will survive on Commonwealth funds. In this way, the government's bill will act as a disincentive for students to join their student union. Student unions will be empty shells and the Commonwealth government will have destroyed the student union movement it purports to defend. Throughout this debate, government members have put up a concerted effort to portray themselves as the defenders of students' welfare, as fearless crusaders for the students of Australia. However, if it were not for the efforts of the coalition since the last election, Australian students would now be struggling under the weight of a HECS regime in which tuition fees for students who took longer to finish their courses would have increased by 50 per cent and in which fees payable for second degrees would have increased by 100 per cent. The changes that the Labor government attempted to put in place last year were totally unacceptable, and the attack on students continues. Today the House has debated government legislation which seeks to extract earlier payments of HECS from students who work for part of the year after they first leave full time study. The government has attempted to defend this change saying it is a logical extension of the pro rata changes it introduced earlier this year. All I can say is that students should watch out for further logical extensions. It is the coalition which is defending, and will continue to defend, student interest and it is the government which poses the threat to these interests. The legislation we are debating today should be seen as an attempt to obscure this fact. I cannot support the government's Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill. Despite the rhetoric, this bill does not serve the interests of Australian university students. It is a cynical, political act by a government whose focus is firmly fixed on the next election.",35
16,Mr CHYNOWETH,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I begin by making a few comments on that last speech. The honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) mentioned that at the last state election the Victorian government put this change to the people of the state of Victoria. I do not think the honourable member lives in Victoria. I do not know whether she was there at the last state election. I can assure you I was there, and I can assure you it was not put to the people or the students of Victoria. At the moment the Kennett government does what it likes. It blatantly lies. This is another act of hitting the people of Victoria. The honourable member also stated that the union will be surviving out of the pocket of the Labor government-that is, if this bill comes through they will be dependent on us, will be looking to us for handouts and, therefore, will do what we bid, what we wish. Nothing could be further from the truth. You have only to look at the students out there today protesting, and we have not even passed the bill. If they were going to be in our pocket, you would reckon they would be out there keeping nice and quiet, but not the students. They are out there having a go. I think they are protesting right now about upfront fees and all sorts of things. They are certainly not in our pocket, I can assure you of that. I have never had the opportunity to go to university. I have never belonged to a student union, so I do not really know what they do. However, way back in the Vietnam days I was involved with students. In those days to get to university you had to come from a fairly wealthy family or get a scholarship or something like that. I was never smart enough to get a scholarship and I did not come from a wealthy family, so I did not go to university. I went to work instead. I always recall all these long-haired kids marching up and down Bourke Street. I was dressed a bit like I am now. I sold office equipment at the time. I was a fairly straitlaced sort of person. They seemed quite reasonable people. They had different views from those I had. They were against the Vietnam War and that particular point of view was not too popular in those days. They seemed to object to all sorts of things. My wife is doing a correspondence course through Deakin University and I often see the paper that gets sent to her. Some of the stuff in it is quite amazing. But it gives the university students and those people involved with it a voice and they can put their point of view. I may not agree with a lot of what I read. I remember seeing in this House a paper from Monash University called Lot s Wife and a whole page was in relation to the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). That student newspaper certainly made interesting reading. This bill is all about giving students the freedom of speech that was going to be cut out by Jeffrey Kennett and a few other conservative state Premiers. Kennett will do anything to muzzle speech. We are talking about the policy of the Liberal-National coalition in Victoria before the last election, and I just happen to have it here. 'Giving students a chance' is the heading of its policy document. It is full of waffle. In this policy it never mentioned it was going to sack 8,000 teachers, close 500 schools, put kids in buses and ship them a long distance, force kids to travel across dangerous roads to get to schools, cut out lollipop ladies and all those sorts of things, such as special teachers and special programs. However, it does say one thing that relates to this particular bill. It a code of conduct, which is interesting. Maybe Jeffrey or Mr Hayward should re-read this. It states: All students have the right to work in a secure environment where they feel free to develop to the full their special gifts, interests and ambitionsand the last couple of words are importantwithout intimidation. That is what is going on. That is what the Premier of Victoria is trying to do to the university students and, might I say, to other students within the Victorian education system. One only has to look at the intimidation of the teachers there. Many teachers come to see me with complaints, even though I am a federal member. I say to them, 'Why don't you give me something in writing and I will see what I can doT And they say, 'No, we can't put that down in writing. We couldn't give you that information. Our name would get onto a list and we would probably be shipped off to some country school or put on the not wanted list.' Teachers in Victoria are afraid of speaking out because of intimidation by the Victorian government. Many years ago when Joh Bjelke-Petersen was in charge in Queensland a friend of mine who was a teacher put his name on a protest petition that went to state parliament. Within a month of his putting his name on the petition he got a promotion to Bourke, or somewhere out in the back of Queensland. He could never work out why. That is the sort of thing that is going on in Victoria right now. This bill is aimed at giving back to students their voice which was to be silenced. As I said, students do not always agree with the federal government. Often they speak out against it-at the majority of times they probably do-but to take away that right is wrong. To give a little bit of a history to the evolution of this particular matter, I will go through some of the things which have been in the newspapers recently. The federal government was warned yesterday not to interfere with the state government's volunhas tary student unionism legislation. Mr Storey, the state Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, lashed out at federal threats to overrule the state government. He stated: This is a decision about freedom of association, and the federal government should not interfere. This billMr Storey's billwill prevent universities from from the Commonwealth government to student organisations. This follows the federal government's threat to reimburse student unions by reducing state education revenue. The honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who was the federal Deputy Leader of the Opposition and education spokesman, lauded the state legislation. He stated: . . . the government had struck a blow for the fundamental human rights of freedom of association. He was talking there about the state government-the fundamental human right of freedom of association. The honourable member for Chisholm, of course, is a doctor. The greatest, most powerful union in Australia today is not the students' union, the maritime union or the clerks' union; it is the doctors' union-the AMA. Doctors cannot even become members unless that organisation says that they have passed the test and have a BMW - I do not know what the rules are for doctors to get into that union. But that is the strongest, most powerful and most influential union in Australia today. A doctor cannot practice in the field of medicine unless he or she belongs to that union. Mr Rocher-Rubbish!",38
17,Mr CHYNOWETH,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"You tell me one practising doctor who has not been okayed by the doctors' union. A board has been set up which keeps the boundaries: no-one can practise unless he or she agrees to the actual qualifications set down by that board. We have those sorts of people having a go at students who want to get up and say something which perhaps does not agree with what Jeffrey Kennett wants. Mr Storey, according to an article in the Age of 28 April 1994, refused to comment on a leaked document, written by the Liberal Party's Victorian Division Policy Assembly Education Committee, which stated: We do not want compulsory student moneys flowing out in anti-Kennett and anti-coalition campaigns and other fringe activities of the hard student Left. Mr Storey insisted that the rationale for the bill was simply to establish freedom of giving funds received association. A leaked document from the Liberal Party's own education policy unit shows exactly what Jeffrey Kennett is all about in the legislation he has put through the Victorian parliament. We are out to stop it-and I think it should be stopped. Voluntary student unionism, as proposed by Mr Kennett, Mr Storey and Mr HaywardI imagine he is involved in it-will have a devastating effect on women. As stated in the Australian of 30 March 1994: Voluntary student unionism will have a disproportionately negative impact on female students. Voluntary student unionism is an altem!?t to privatise student organisations and to establish a system of ""user pays"". This will hit female students in two main ways. First women are economically worse off than their mal; counterparts. Second, women both within and beyond the education system are discriminated against in society. As a consequence, not only are women less able to afford support services but they are in greater need of those services. A lot of the services that are set up by the student unions are directed straight towards looking after the needs of female students. Some of the areas of service that will be lost if student unions do not have these funds are a personal accident insurance scheme, a union minibus, union recreation services, entertainment, publications, clubs and societies. It is very important that people going through university-I imagine it is; as I have said, I have not been there-mix with others and during those formative years come to their own points of view. It is important for them to be exposed to all types of views. If this funding were not to be available and were cut down by Jeffrey Kennett and his cohorts, those sorts of things would cease and one point of view would be put; and that point of view, no doubt, would be the Liberal Party's point of view, whatever it is these days-one cannot find out what it is. Mr Haddon Storey, the Victorian minister, as reported in the Australian of 11 May 1994: ... has dismissed as ""emotive"" comments by the vice-chancellor of Melbourne University, Professor David Penington, that voluntary student unionism legislation could seriously damage universities. As the member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) said, Professor Penington is certainly no friend of the Labor Party, but Professor Penington has gone through university and he can see the advantages of free speech. He can see that students take advantage of all these various clubs, activities, child care and other facilities and publications that are supplied by the student union. I do not know what Professor Penington is supporting-who knows what he is supporting-but I believe that he thinks what Jeffrey Kennett and other conservative state Premiers are trying to do is completely wrong. I also have an article that is of the opinion that the union bill will kill off campus newspapers. I spoke about those publications just a minute ago. They are very important. We may not agree with what they say-we may not agree with 90 per cent or 100 per cent of what they say-but to actually stop their publication, which the state legislation is about, is returning us to Nazi Germany where the authorities burnt the books. This is the same sort of thing. If we do not have that freedom of speech, how will information be disseminated? The campus of Monash University is in my electorate. A few weeks ago I met with the deputy president of the Monash University student union, Mr Jason Rogers, and discussed the legislation with him. Mr Rogers represents 10,000 students at Peninsula and Caulfield campuses. He said that, within the 10,000 people on the campuses, there was strong opposition to the state government's Tertiary Education (Amendment) Bill. He also stated that he was pleased that some of the university vice-chancellors were coming out and also opposing it. One of the things the state bill relates to is fundraising. The Monash University student union has been attempting to raise $2 million towards a $5 million amenities building for students on the Peninsula campus. The building, which is to be funded by the federal government, will house a cafeteria service, gymnasium, lounge and other services. The federal government is putting in $3 million and the student union $2 million. What for? For the benefit of those people who use the university. It is not for the benefit of members of the Labor Party who happen to be on the campus at the time. I am quite certain they will use it, but so will members of the Liberal Party who happen to be on that campus. It will be there for all students to use. That project would be jeopardised were this state legislation to be imposed on the students. Mr Rogers has said that the state government's proposed banning of fees for campus activities would have, in effect, removed many services enjoyed by students. He said that the result would have been that many of the present services provided by the union would have been taken over by fast food outlets. MCDonald's, instead of the unions, would have been looking after the campuses. We only have to look at what has happened with Victorian hospitals. MCDonald's is in the children's hospital. Various fast food chains have gone on to secondary college campuses, all with the blessing of Mr Hayward and Mr Kennett. One wonders who the MCDonald's franchisees are who get contracts to go into these areas. I could not put this situation better than it has been put by Rebecca Peniston-Bird in two articles appearing in the Australian. The first article states: Student unions exist to serve and promote the interests of all students. Fees aside, there is one student voice and that voice is legitimate because it is accessible to all students via the democratic process. The second article states: Opponents of universal membership of student unions say their emphasis is on the principle involved-freedom of association, or noncompulsory levies-but all they ever talk about is how much they dislike the actual student bodies concerned. This freedom of association line is simply used to mask the fact that it's not our existence that offends the Liberal governments, but our politics. That is what it boils down to. Liberal governments do not mind the student unions; they just do not like the politics of the people involved. The article continues: Student associations have opposed Liberal and Labor higher education policies because both parties want higher fees and lower living allowances for students. The crucial feature of student associations that has marked them off for destruction is that Liberal students don't often get elected on campuses, not just in Victoria, but across Australia. Perhaps it is the Government's position that if Liberal club students do not have control of student affairs, then democracy is no longer viable. Rebecca Peniston-Bird has put the argument quite succinctly. Kennett wants to cut down the student unions because the Liberals cannot get control of them. They cannot have a say. One remembers that, when the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) was at university, the Liberals tried to get control of the student unions. I do not know whether they did. I think Mr Kroger and the honourable member for Higgins were involved in a fight over this matter at Monash many years ago. I did not go there; I just recall that there was a bit of talk about it. The whole history of this matter was outlined on a page in Lot's Wife. The Liberals thought that now that Jeffrey was in power they might be able to get control of student unions. They will not. Until the Liberal Party gets itself together, until it gets a few policies and puts them to students, it will never get control of student unions. That is what the Liberal Party does not like, and that is why it is trying to stifle that voice-a voice of democracy. We may not all agree with that voice, but it must be heard.",40
18,Mr ROCHER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) wove reference to freedom of speech into his rather disjointed contribution. He implied that the coalition's opposition to this legislation represented an attack on freedom of speech. There is nothing free in this legislation; it is very expensive indeed. It is expensive in terms of the amounts of money that will be inflicted on taxpayers. The government's proposals will affect taxpayers in those states that have the temerity, in the eyes of this doctrinaire Labor administration, to insist on freedom of association-the right of students to belong or not to belong to a student union or guild. In the mind of the honourable member, freedom of speech is dependent on having money thrown at it. In other words, freedom of speech cannot exist unless it is funded. That has never been the case in the history of the world, and it should never be the case. There is no finer advocate for the education policies of the Victorian government than the honourable member for Dunkley. Whilst he might not have intended it, that is what he certainly managed to convey. The questions involved in this legislationand our opposition to it-cannot and should not be answered by political talk. The question is whether individual students, who are said to be the beneficiaries of the proposals, are willing to layout the cash needed to keep going the services that will be provided. There is no argument which would support answering that question in the affirmative. The Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill 1994 is yet another example of Labor's outrageous double standards and its lack of concern for basic human rights when these rights conflict with the doctrinaire interests of the Australian Labor Party. The bill seeks to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, the principal act, to make provision for the Commonwealth to directly fund student unions or guilds for the loss of compulsory membership fees in circumstances where a state takes, or has taken, action to implement voluntary student unionism. The bill will also allow the Commonwealth to make direct payments to student organisations for certain undisclosed, permitted purposes. A corresponding clause in the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1994, which was introduced into the House on 29 June this year and debated earlier, will allow the Commonwealth to recover any moneys paid to student organisations for this purpose from the states general purpose grants. This bill represents an attempt by Labor to entrench compulsory student unionism within the ethos of Australian higher education institutions through the provision of direct taxpayer funding to student organisations and through the thuggery of federal financial coercion of state governments. To put it bluntly, this bill seeks to override the legitimate and democratic legislation in Victoria and Western Australia and to override proposed steps towards the introduction of similar legislation by the Tasmanian government. It concerns me and many on this side of the House that the operation of this bill effectively limits those rights that all minded Australians have come to expect: the basic rights of freedom of choice and freedom of association. This is the reason the coalition opposes this bill. There are other reasons, which I will touch upon later. Under the Fraser government, such basic rights were acknowledged and protected in the form of the Australian National University Amendment Act 1979 and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Act 1979. These pieces of legislation ensured that membership of student organisations was made voluntary, that the fees payable for membership of student organisations was made voluntary and that compulsory fees could be levied only for the provision of amenities and services. Where the council of the university or college made compulsory fees money available to a student organisation for the provision of approved services or amenities, the council had first to be satisfied that the governing body of that organisation was representative of its members, and it then had to ensure that money was applied only for the provision of amenities and services that were not of an academic nature and were of direct benefit to the university. That is the record of the coalition and the Fraser government. As well as ensuring a student's basic right to freedom of association, the Fraser government recognised and respected the sovereignty of the states and did not attempt to use the states grants legislation to force state government action on this issue. That coalition government limited itself merely to recommending that the states follow the Commonwealth's lead. In contrast to this entirely reasonable and sensible approach, let us renect on Labor's illustrious history on compulsory student unionism. The Labor Party has a shameful record of enforcing the undemocratic and unrepresentati ve policy of compulsory membership of, and payment of fees to, student organisations and unions. In January 1982, the then shadow minister for education, Mr John Dawkins, indicated that Labor would 'act to ensure the autonomy of student unions'. In reality, this meant that Labor fair- would force all tertiary students to become members of a political student union and to provide financial support to that union in the form of the payment of compulsory fees. The payment of those fees would become a precondition to their receiving education, regardless of whether they wanted to become members of a student union. In 1984 the Hawke government legislated to remove the fair and equitable controls on student union fees that were introduced by the Fraser government and that were to apply to higher education institutions in the Australian Capital Territory. Under the Fraser government, accountability and responsibility were fostered and encouraged. The Hawke government ensured the demise of efficient and representative student organisations that were accountable to individual students. But that was only the beginning. In 1992, after initial indications from the Victorian and Western Australian state governments that they would be legislating to outlaw compulsory student union fees, the Keating government amended the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to ensure that institutions would receive funds to pass on to student organisations if they were prevented from collecting compulsory fees by lawful state government action. The State Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1993 was then passed. Section 20 of the act enables the Commonwealth to recoup from the states any money paid by the Commonwealth for the purpose of funding student organisations. That legislation was also introduced in response to proposals from the Victorian and Western Australian state governments to outlaw compulsory student fees. Not only is the amendment a complete abuse of state responsibilities; it also sets an ugly precedent because it overrules state sovereignty. We now have the Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill before us, which is the proverbial icing on the cake. But why the fuss? Why put so much effort into circumventing state attempts to give university students the right to choose whether or not to join a union, guild, organisation or whatever else one chooses to call the current student university unions? Labor's current draconian stance on this issue is far from unpredictable for reasons that are blatantly obvious. The government would have this House and students across Australia believe that this legislation is to protect the human rights of students. Nothing could be further from the truth. This government claims that voluntary student unionism-this so-called heinous act which would allow students to exercise their right to freedom of association, as do all other Australians-is intended to restrict students' expressions of views on public issues by choking open debate of government policies as they affect the institution and the student body. I am sure that I speak for all fair-minded students when I say that the only side of the debate that is currently being choked in student unions and organisations around the country is that which differs from Labor. In reality, student unions, particularly the National Union of Students, are strongly Labor oriented organisations, and they do not care who knows it. Almost all student unions use part of their compulsorily acquired funds to pay for affiliate membership to the National Union of Students. The NUS is the central organisation to which about 80 per cent of Australian public university campuses are affiliated. It is interesting but not very surprising that, when we look at the fine print, we discover that, out of all the university campuses affiliated with the NUS, only a small minority of students from those universities have ever bothered to vote for that affiliation. Of those who did vote, only about nine per cent actually voted in favour of becoming affiliated with NUS. In reality, this very active political organisation which claims to represent 80 per cent, or 400,000, of the 575,000 students enrolled in Australian public universities would be lucky to represent 40,000 students. But it is not just the National Union of Students which is unrepresentative. The proportion of students who vote at student union elections around the country varies between universities. In 1993-and I take an example which is fairly representative of the usual trend from year to year-the University of Sydney recorded the country's highest voter turnout of only 16 to 17 per cent of students enrolled. Deakin University recorded the lowest voter turnout with only three per cent of the student population bothering to vote in student union elections. What we have here is a situation where a student organisation compels students to pay a compulsory fee, purporting to be acting in the interests of all students, whilst at best it is representative of a majority of the views of only 16 per cent of the student population. But what is more alarming is the fact that these grossly unrepresentative organisations are nothing more than Labor training grounds for Labor lackeys. These organisations cannot even claim to be representative of one-quarter of the student population, yet they are in a position to receive a significant portion of the compulsory funds levied on students and can then use those compulsorily acquired funds for political purposes. In the 1993 federal election, NUS spent more than $100,000 of students' compulsory fees on an anti-Liberal campaign entitled 'Put the Liberals Last'. Is there any doubt then why the Labor Party places so much importance on having a strong and well funded support base in the form of the National Union of Students and student unions on university campuses? I do not think so. Is there any misconception as to why the current Labor government is so intent on ignoring the sovereignty of the states of Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania by overruling those state governments' legitimate legislation in the form of this bill? I do not think so. Is there any uncertainty about whether the federal government will respect the rights of Australian students when it comes to their right to freedom of association? The answer is clearly yes. This government considers students as nothing more than second-class citizens when it comes to their freedom. Labor is only too happy to jump on the bandwagon of international treaty making and human rights conventions. And so it should. The right to free speech and freedom of association forms the very cornerstone of our democracy and our society. However, this government lacks the ability to stand up for its convictions almost as much as it is prepared to abandon so many other of those basic rights when it is politically expedient. It is this government, in the name of human and civil rights under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, that will overrule the legitimate right of the democratically elected Tasmanian government to determine and maintain its own laws and criminal code. I remind the government that article 22 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a signatory and which Australia has ratified, also states that everyone shall have the right to freedom of association. But when the rights of students conflict with the interests of the Labor Party, human rights and civil liberties are conveniently forgotten. Clearly, these measures are in breach of article 22 of the United Nations convention. It is a sorry reflection on Labor that it selectively chooses to both abide by and ignore its own rules of fairness and justice according to its own politically expedient ends. What does the government do when the states move to legislate for voluntary student unionism? Not only does it attempt to legislate to ensure that unrepresentative and politically active student organisations receive direct funding from the federal government; it then financially penalises the state concerned by removing from state grants that amount which has been paid by the federal government to the student organisations. The government is quite prepared to give students all the freedom in the world to express their views on public issues as long as they are complementary to Labor's agenda. We should ask ourselves what this government is afraid of. What difference would it make if students were given a choice? The obvious answer is that Labor would stand to lose its unrepresentative but well-funded support bases on university campuses and student unions would become democratic and accountable organisations representative of the views of the campus. To argue that student services and amenities would decline as a result of voluntary student unionism is clearly ridiculous. Individual students already get very little from student unions. In fact, most of the services and amenities that these unions provide would be better provided by university administrations. We should ask ourselves again what this government has done for tertiary students since it came into office. Labor is denying, and has denied, students their right to freedom of association. In the 1991-92 budget, Labor increased the annual HECS contribution charge levied on all tertiary students by $144 above the normal indexation increase. In the 1993-94 budget, Labor increased the rate of repayment of the HECS debt by one per cent for each of the income threshold categories. Under Labor, the tertiary student to academic staff ratio has increased by 37 per cent in the years 1982 to 1992. It now has the audacity to make the Australian taxpayer fund student services and political activities that a clear majority of students themselves do not want to fund. It is nothing short of disgraceful that student newspapers, both internal and external political campaigns and student elections should be funded by Australian taxpayers. Taxpayers and students alike should be outraged that Labor proposes to undermine any accountability that voluntary student unionism would otherwise bring to student organisations. This bill is a major abuse of the states' responsibilities. It denies students their fundamental right to freedom of association. (Time expired)",42
19,Mr GRIFFIN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Corinella) (12.24 p.m.)The purpose of the Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill 1994 is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 in accordance with Commonwealth government responsibilities in respect of providing benefits to students within Australian higher education institutions. The bill provides for the continued support of existing student services within Australian higher education institutions through an amendment to the act, which will allow the Commonwealth to make payments to student organisations directly and recover funds from the states' general revenue assistance, if necessary. The bill will also allow the Commonwealth to make payments to student organisations directly for certain permitted purposes. The recovery of funds will be possible under a provision contained in proposed section 15 of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1994. This mechanism ensures that there will be no additional budgetary implications. The provisions contained in the bill will override the provisions of any state law or any other action a state may take to the contrary. The amendment is a direct result of the Tertiary Education (Amendment) Act 1994 passed by the Victorian government and the actions of the Tasmanian state government towards the University of Tasmania. In this debate, I want to look at the culture of universities and the role of student unions. Students unions, associations or guilds are a tradition developed many years ago at Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom. They are not a new phenomenon. It is also to be noted that the term 'student union' is somewhat of a misnomer. Student unions are not unions in the industrial sense, especially since students are not employees in an industry. Student unions are not industrial organisations that negotiate wages and conditions on their members' behalf. Student unions are more in the nature of community clubs which provide a range of services to their members. Student unions do, however, engage in political campaigns and take stands on issues affecting students, such as education fees and student allowances, in a similar way to industrial trade unions and other interest groups. However, student associations are essential for countless services, such as cheap food and drink, photocopying, housing, sport, recreation, theatre, social groups, appeals, complaints, career counselling, sexual assault counselling and services for international students. It is clear that the Victorian government's legislation is aimed directly at attacking the right of student associations to actively consider and promote ideas and issues. The conservatives oppose student associations having a wider role beyond that of basic service delivery. They oppose political campaigning by student unions, be it on international issues, issues relating directly to students-such as higher education funding, tertiary fees or other campus related mattersor wider discussion and debate of the actions of state or federal governments. Student newspapers perform a particular role that the Victorian Liberal government finds repugnant. Student papers promote a range of issues, differing perspectives and alternative viewpoints. I have read many student newspapers over the last 15 years. Although I have not agreed with many of the articles I have read, I have been impressed by the information contained therein, the quality of many of the publications and the necessity to have such publications circulating within universities. It is interesting to note that all sides of politics have involved themselves in student politics and have sought and gained elected office within student associations. In 1916, Sir Robert Menzies, the founder of the Liberal Party, was an editor of a student newspaper. More recently, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and reluctant leader in waiting, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), happily involved himself in student union activities along with his friend Michael Kroger, the well-known merchant banker and Clayton's candidate for Kooyong. University life has always encouraged a diversity of views and a democratic right to espouse those views and to seek support for them. There has been a great tradition in universities of self-development and selfdiscovery. It has come about through questioning and assessing matter, discussion and debate. It is inevitable that students in these circumstances will question why the world is in the state it is and why our leaders do what they do. That may seem to our coalition colleagues to be radical and out of place for an educational institution, but that is the tradition on which our education institutions have developed. That is why universities have been breeding grounds for ideas and student bodies that question our society. The women's movement, the environmental movement and the Third World movement were born out of the student movement. The universities of our countries have been the birthplaces of much of this activity. It is only natural that young university students question the direction of our society and its leaders. The questioning in which young people engage at university through student unions is an acknowledgment that they view the world differently from their parents. They are the ones who must deal with the problems of the future and the present. We must acknowledge that young people are left with the responsibility of dealing with the problems of tomorrow that have been created by those in authority today. That is why students question things and why they may appear to be radical to some people who do not like what they have to say. Such activities are an essential part of campus life. In a democratic, pluralist society, they are activities that are entitled to be supported. Historically, they have been supported by all sides of politics. It is only with the advent of the New Right within the Liberal Party post the departure of Sir Robert Menzies that we have seen the conservatives embrace this issue as a cause celebre. For most of this century, the right of students to engage in these sorts of activities was never a political question. The actions of the Kennett government on this issue are a case study on the way that government operates. The Victorian legislation was clearly politically motivated. A document sent to Victorian coalition members in February 1994 by a Liberal Party education policy committee stated: We do not want compulsory student moneys flowing out to anti-Kennett and anti-coalition campaigns and other fringe activities of the student left. Previously, it had been reported that a spokesman for the Victorian education minister, Mr Storey, had said: . .. the legislation was not intended to affect ""genuine"" services, but to curtail compulsory funding for political activities. In this respect, it is no different from the Kennett government's actions regarding a range of issues: on the question of restrictions to FOI legislation, as we have seen recently in relation to the Grand Prix; on the question of local government amalgamations; on the sacking of Moira Rayner, which was referred to earlier by the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Clee1and); and on the assault on the award system and restrictions to trade union activity-all actions couched in libertarian rhetoric in an inept attempt to conceal broader political objectives. The original bill proposed was even more draconian than that which was passed. The initial outrage over the proposed bill came from a range of sources, most notably from Professor David Penington, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne and not someone who could be painted as a friend of Labor. He attacked the Victorian government over the legislation, calling it intrusive, absurd and undermining university cultural life and autonomy. Following the hue and cry that resulted from the draft bill, some amendments were made. Proposed section 12F included some activities that were to be banned. These were: visual arts, performing arts and audio-visual media; debating; libraries and reading rooms; academic support; accident insurance; orientation information; and support for overseas students. The amended section 12F also gave the minister the power to declare any facility, service or activity to be for the direct benefit of an institution or its students. That such activities were not included in the draft bill says a lot about what the Kennett government thinks about universities and the role that they play. It also says a lot about how paranoid the conservatives are regarding potential sources of criticism and dissent. There are a number of arguments for and hard against compulsory student unionism. The one which I suppose holds the most support is the question of freedom of association, which has been referred to today by a number of honourable members. The principal argument against compulsory student union membership is that it infringes upon the fundamental right to freedom of association. This is the argument used by the Western Australian government when introducing its legislation on the subject. It said: Australia is a signatory to three international agreements specifically outlawing the practice of compulsory association. Article 20 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that ""everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association"". Australia is also a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Labour Organisation's convention concerning freedom of associations. Those conventions specifically denounce the practice of compelling individuals to become members of associations. UN General Assembly resolution 217(111) of 10 December 1948, in addressing those statements on human rights, stipulates that ""every individual and every organ of society should strive to secure their universal recognition and observance"". Governments have an obligation to protect the rights and liberties of their citizens. As legislators, we have an obligation to uphold and defend those rights and freedoms which have been universally recognised, including the right to freedom of association. Opponents of this view argue that compulsory student union membership does not constitute an infringement of freedom of association and that this has been confirmed in the courts. In Clark v. University of Melbourne-a case which was referred to earlier by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner)-the full court of the Supreme Court of Victoria held that the 'essence of the university's powers is that they are powers of self-government, affecting only those who choose to become members by enrolment' and that 'they cannot touch anyone who does not voluntarily bring himself within their reach'. More recently, in Harradine v. University of Adelaide, the full court of the Supreme Court of South Australia stated: The suggestion that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is at all relevant to the issue here is not sound. That Declaration is not part of the domestic law of South Australia. In any event, CL8 of Statute XXV does not deny the rights in Article 20 to anyone. The Article does not demand that there be no qualification for entry to a university as a student. Nor does it contemplate a ""union"" at a university. Moreover, no-one is compelled to belong to the union. Membership follows lawful entry to graduate study at the university. And, of course, membership produced by payment of a fee can be ignored, never exercised. At both an international level and in local courts, it is apparent that compulsory student unionism does not constitute a breach of any legally known provision of freedom of association. Opponents of compulsory student unionism have argued that it is wrong to require a person to pay fees to a union which may in tum make financial contributions to political campaigns which run contrary to that person's beliefs. This argument, although superficially attractive, misunderstands the nature of student associations. They are elected bodies. They are representative bodies not unlike local, state or federal government, or other community based organisations that represent a constituency. On many occasions, I have questioned the actions of my local government, my state government and, at times, the federal government. Often, people do not agree with the actions of those who are elected to represent them. Any action, by definition, will almost certainly lack unanimity. Representative organisations act according to their charters, in what their elected representatives decide is in the best interests of their constituency. It is in the nature of democracy that there are winners and losers and that the taxes or fees of the losers will be spent on the winners' agenda. There is nothing to prevent one from becoming politically involved in order to change policies one disagrees with, and examples of this have been quoted today in this chamber by members on both sides of the House who have endeavoured to do that through the student movement. Also, there is still the right for students to choose to attend a higher education institution where one can claim conscientious objection to the payment of fees. Another issue which is often raised is the question of institutional autonomy. Administrators of higher education institutions have generally defended their right to impose compulsory student union fees on the basis of institutional autonomy. For example, in 1978, the Vice-Chancellor of the ANU asserted: The oversight of student organisations was a matter which was properly the responsibility of Council. That is, the university council. In 1989, the Chairman of the AVCC, Professor B.G. Wilson, said that unions were 'an integral part of campus life'. The professor continued: In recent years it has been one or two actions on single issues by student political clubs and newspapers that have caused some heartburn. In the context of the larger student union picture, they are few in number and only a tiny minority in budgetary considerations. He also stated that many universities already allowed or were moving towards student exemptions on the basis of conscientious objection. At the same time universities were aware that, if membership of student unionism became non-compulsory, many would simply opt out. Professor Wilson continued: What we should realise is that because student unions rely heavily on student participation and volunteer labour, many of the facilities they provide are at reduced costs to their student members. Many have also committed themselves to longerterm debts on permanent buildings and sporting facilities and without compulsory membership, they would be unable to repay these debts which would total many millions of dollars across Australia. The AVCC underlined this view in its latest policy statement, noting: . . . government must recognise that universities are autonomous and that autonomy is necessary to protect open enquiry ... and that autonomy and diversity should be recognised, maintained and rewarded by ensuring that universities retain control over admission of students to university ... The Kennett government's actions are a direct attack on university autonomy and should therefore be opposed. The Victorian government also argues that money is being wasted and massive savings will be made by stopping political activities involving student newspapers or other areas of student union or association activity. The truth is that very little of the fees collected from student dues are used for political activity. Approximately three per cent to five per cent of the fees would be allocated to activities that could be defined as broadly political. The remainder of the money would be allocated to such things as the cafeteria, student services, sport, entertainment, theatre, and clubs and societies. That is where 95 per cent to 97 per cent of the student fees go. The argument being used about massive savings in student fees is deceitful. Students will not save much money as a result of this legislation. In fact, they will have less ability to have a say about what happens. For political reasons, some states wish to break down student organisations. They are not about replacing or providing the services in another way; they are about eliminating these services or operating them on an individual user-pays basis, which effectively eliminates many of the services or sees them distributed unequally along the lines of wealth. In the same way as citizens are able to engage in the political process, students are able to participate in their organisations and are able to control their organisation's policies and actions. They have an obligation to support the society they take part in, either through general taxation or union dues. State electors pay tax, federal electors pay tax and local electors pay rates. Student unions are democratically elected bodies representing students. The conservative state governments jump up and down about liberty whenever it means that they can put at a disadvantage some group which is able to raise a voice against anything they do . The aim of the anti student union legislation is to completely disempower students. It is a fundamental right of students to be able to be critical of government, and it is of key importance that critical thinking is developed and encouraged in our universities. Those hit hardest will be the students of the smaller, less wealthy and most isolated institutions, which are already the least able to stand up for their own rights. This government has the power to act. It has a responsibility to safeguard the rights of students. The Kennett government is once again up to its old tricks, attacking its opponents with whatever means are at its disposal. There is broad support within the university sector for the actions this government is taking. The bill deserves the support of this House and of those opposite. I commend the bill to the House.",45
20,Mr RICHARD EVANS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I join this debate to support my colleagues on this side of the House opposing the Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill. I commend the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) because he brought a lot of arguments to the debate which are very pro our point of view. He did not really answer with any substance at all the reasons why this legislation has been brought forward. The Labor Party is like a wily old fox. It shows cunning and stealth in many of the things it does. In Australia, the fox is considered to be vermin. The ALP plays the game of politics as if it is the creator of all things Australian, as if it provides for all Australian people. It has put its people into positions of power within most community groups in Australia to speak against any opposition. It owns the union movement. It puts its people in positions of power in the Public Service to provide ease of flow of information to it. It promotes certain journalists to push its agenda, as confirmed by Monica Attard the other day at the Walkley awards. In more recent times it has even put its own leaders in gaol. Who knows why it does this? It is probably to recruit future members. I do not know. I am sure Brian Burke and David Parker, both convicted criminals and former leaders of the Labor Party, are examples of the fine principles under which this party sometimes operates. We all know that the Labor Party distorts the truth, especially when it comes to keeping its word. Goebbels, that fantastic propagandist of the 1940s, did the same thing. His idea was to keep telling the same story long enough and eventually it will be accepted to be the truth. This is the current story the ALP, the Labor Party, tells in Australia. It says that there no unemployment problem in Australia. It says that there is no overcrowding in our education system. It says that there are no problems with our health services or overcrowding in hospitals. It says that we have no problem accepting international treaties in Australia. It says that there is no problem with the social security system. This is the story that the Labor Party, the party that used to represent the interests of the Australian worker, now represents. But does it accord with the truth? The truth is that the ALP, the so-called workers party, is the party that drops people from unemployment benefits if they do not meet the standards required by the performance contracts that unemployed people are required to sign. The Labor Party also looks after the youth so well that in Australia we have fewer apprentices in training that we ever had before. This is the party that has ignored the needs of our rural community for the last four years. Its members are coming out this afternoon to talk about marvellous rural things that should have been done four years ago. This is the party that looks after our senior citizens with so much disdain that at the last election it said senior citizens would not have to pay tax any more. That lasted until 15 March, two days after the election. This is the party of high spending and high borrowing. This is the party that is creating a financial crisis for our future generations. Australians need to understand that our youth will be paying the bills that we are now creating for ourselves. This is the party that says, 'Do it our way or not at all.' The romper stompers of social engineering and the thought police of the ALP are now at it again. The Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill is typical of the way the Labor Party plays politics-like the fox. Like the vermin the fox is to this country, so too is the tawdry way the Labor Party treats the Australian people. Democracy is all about choice. Many Australians who vote for the Labor Party have fought in defence of our country to make sure that Australians have freedom of choice. But, is sadly, this bill perpetuates the Labor notion of no choice, and therefore no democracy. This bill takes the choice of Australian students away from them, more so in the states of Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania. These states have applied legislation which allows students to choose whether they wish to join the formerly compulsory student unions or not to. Students-let us think about this concept-the very future of our nation, should have the basic rights of any democratic citizen; that is, the freedom to join an association or the freedom to choose not to. Yet the Labor Party, that wily and cunning old fox, wishes to perpetuate the notion that our country's youth have no responsibility and therefore demands that they join unions. It is the right of the majority of Australians to freedom of religion. They have freedom of political choice, freedom to carryon their lives to their benefit and to this country's benefit. Yet the Labor government would have none of that. It does not give people choices. This notion is quite foreign to the members of the ALP, the romper stompers opposite. They insist that students, free thinking Australians, must join a union. reason for demanding such is the totalitarian notion of penalising those states which legislated for such freedom of choice. The government insists through this bill that states do not have the right to legislate their own affairs. The states do not have the right legislate for freedom of choice. This governproduced ment insists that the states cannot provide choice to their own students at university. government is planning to withhold funds the respective state governments do not comply with demanding that students join unions. No choice there! It has been said by those with some knowledge of this matter that student unions provide a very definite service to students and that therefore all students should be members. I am sure that some services are provided which add to university life and help some students. I remind the House that many notable Australians have served as student representatives within certain universities, mostly Labor politicians, confirming the view that the union is financially supporting the growth of Labor Party members. The first and most obvious to come to mind as one who has been part of this whole union movement is David Parker. The minister at the table, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), would remember David Parker. He is the former Deputy Premier of Western Australia, one of the leaders of the Labor Party and now a criminal for spending funds that were donated to him. I do not know whether it is a common approach to Labor politics-we have yet to find out-this notion that if one provides one should join. The concept is that, if one serves you, you must go and join them. I cite in my own electorate the Balga and Morley Salvation Army Corps, which helps a lot of people in my electorate who are subjected to the Labor Party policies and who are really suffering in our disadvantaged society. The corps helps them but does not require them to the join the Salvation Army Corps. Yet the Labor Party thinks that students are different and requires them to join student unions. Let me draw upon a personal experience which highlights the problem associated with The forcing students to join a group which may very well be acting contrary to one's own have beliefs. A constituent of Cowan, a Regina Kroczek of Marangaroo, contacted my office regarding her concerns over a publication of the April-I underline April as it is a signifito cant month-issue of Harambee, a magazine by the student union of Edith Cowan University. Edith Cowan, the nameThe sake of my own electorate, was a leading if campaigner for social justice back in the 1920s. She would turn in her grave if she knew what was happening at the university named after her. My constituent writes: As a student of Edith Cowan University I am appalled at this issue of the student guild publication, Harambee. The cover is offensive to me as a Christian. It is both blasphemous and repulsive. Mr Deputy Speaker, your inquiring mind is probably thinking, 'What sort of thing was happening on the cover of this particular magazine?' The cover actually depicted the figure of Christ-this is in April, around Easter, which is a very important time for most Christians-at the time of crucifixion. This depiction was quite grotesque in its design. It included a huge male appendage, being the penis, in a very unnattering position. This, surely, is the lowest of bad taste student humour. I assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the people responsible for such a design lack the fundamental maturity of knowledge, and thus wisdom, required to publish such a public document. Despite being the open-minded person that I am, I was in fact offended by the depiction. Yes, it is blasphemous and it is degrading to Christians. It is appallingly confrontationist towards any responsible and reasonable citizen. My constituent went on to write: The articles inside the magazine are no more educational than the cover. The editorial itself the most foul language imaginable. Surely, in our country Australia there is still some protection of those who wish to live decent and moral lives, free from ridicule for their beliefs. Not from this union, apparently. She continued: Since the guild is a compulsory union for all students, including Christian students, one would expect this group to show some respect for all members who were forced to join this group. As the guild shows nothing but contempt for anyone who dares to question their standards, and they are a law unto themselves, r request your intervention. If the guild was a voluntary body, they would have no choice but to give quality service to members and to treat all members with dignity and respect. That is something which I think is foreign to a lot of the foxes in Australia. Here is an example of a student who may have been forced to join and risks having her funds used in a totally inappropriate way. The funds of Christian-minded students have been used to distribute Christian denigration and what could be considered threatening pornography. What are others expected to do? Under future state laws, students can be protected for they do not have to fund such activities, yet under this bill they will be forced to endure more abuse. By implication, the Labor Party stands condemned for approving this activity. This is yet another example of the Labor Party's romper stomper attitude to caring Australians: squash freedom and legislate for the enjoyment of a few. These attitudes of the students are shared by other community leaders within the seat of Cowan. The principal of Emmanuel Christian Community School in Girrawheen wrote to me about the very same issue. He said: Thank you for your commitment and dedication to the community ... r write to you to express my deepest concern about what is happening in our universities, especially in the students guild magazine. I refer to the cover of the April issue of the Harrambee produced by the Edith Cowan University student guild. r find the cover offensive, disgusting and insulting to me as a member of the community who works and cares for young people. There could be a little argument that the magazine has impressed many in a very negative way but probably would not have done so if it was produced with funds from a uses voluntary group. The fact that compulsory funding has been used to produce a magazine which pays scant regard to the religious, political and moral attitudes of those that provide the funds is Labor totalitarianism at its finest. These funds are collected through the imposition of draconian rules that require students to join a group in which they have no say as to where those funds are being diverted. It is common knowledge that student union funds were used at the last election against the Liberal Party. What say did those students who wanted an apolitical approach have? Frankly, none. They did not have any choice. Their funds went off to campaign against the Liberal Party. Compulsory student fees have been used to fund student organisations, but under this legislation the Labor government is proposing to use taxpayers' funds to do exactly the same thing. It sounds remarkably familiar-the government providing funds to an organisation that in turn donates funds back to the Labor Party campaign to stay in government. I cite as an example of that particular notion the recent wharfies' pay dispute. They now do not pay tax. They do not pay Medicare. They impinge themselves on the Australian society that everyone else pays for, but the wharfies do not have to pay a thing. What about the comments of the ACTU's Jennie George during the debate on industrial relations? She said that it was payback time. We know how the Labor Party works. Remember the sports rorts affair? We know how funds were generated prior to the last election. The taxes of ordinary Australians are being used to line the pockets of organisations which engage in political, religious and moral campaigns which some taxpayers find offensive. This pay-off policy is unacceptable. This Labor Party pay-off policy to groups who in turn give taxpayers' money back to the Labor Party campaign is totally unacceptable, but I am sure one person would be very proud of it. That person, no doubt, would be David Parker, who is sitting somewhere behind bars this very day. That it is right and just to compel a student to pay a compulsory fee to a student union or risk having enrolment cancelled runs contrary to the very notion of a university. It does nothing to encourage competition and nothing to encourage free thought and diversity. Instead, it defends the typical standard notion of the Labor Party foxes: complacency-bring everyone down to the lowest common denominator. This government is using the romper stomper financial thuggery so typical of its history to bring about a political agenda that is contrary to that of some state governments who wish to bring about democratic freedom to students by outlawing compulsory student unionism. This bill continues the bombastic nature of the Labor Party. I said before that the Labor Party is very much like the fox. This biIl is sly like the and creates and continues the damage that most foxes do to Australia. For these reasons I do not support this bill.  Kissinger once said, 'The reason student politics is so intense is because so little stake.' The parliament should not be debating the Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill today. The bill should never have been submitted and the government should not be wasting our time. I oppose this bill for two main reasons. Raising voluntary student unionism in the federal arena intervenes in something that should be left to the states or, even better, to students themselves. At the same time, it also seeks to use public funds to buy off student leaders. As someone who six years ago was happily battling away in student politics, I know that voluntary student unionism is scarcely an important issue among students. The only trouble is, for reasons best known to itself, the government has decided to legislate on this matter in an entirely inappropriate manner. It seems to feel as if it has to cover every contingency. Today's bill is nothing but an exercise in puerile zealotry, appropriate for a measure that has nothing to do with this House or this parliament but which is best left to student politicians, carried out with the complete lack of responsibility and financial prudence that all too often marks student politics. The government is likely to say that the Liberal Party is totally opposed to student unionism. This just is not the case. In New South Wales, the state with the longest serving Liberal government, there has been no serious move to introduce voluntary student unionism. In my home state of South Australia, the state with the most recent Liberal leadership, the Minister for Employment, Training and Further Education, Bob Such, has rightly pointed out that the term 'student union' is something of a misnomer and that 'student association' is a better term. FoIlowing on from this, he has made the point, 'We regard university students as adults and, accordingly, the responsibility is on them to fox, involve themselves in student association activities. ' The states that have legislated for VSU have clearly stated their intention to do so in election platforms and have made provision for the supply of a wide variety of student is at amenities and services through other means. If the Liberal Party has had an objection with student unionism it has been over the campaigns they have waged with their members' money, supposedly on behalf of their members' interests. When I arrived on campus in the mid1980s, the old Australian Union of Students had just collapsed. Students were sick of AUS 'cause whores'. They were sick of seeing their funds wasted as various splinter groups of the Left fought battles in public, each side making more extravagantly embarrassing remarks. More rational students from the ALP, the Liberal Party and a whole range of other groups organised and campus after campus voted to disaffiliate. AUS coIlapsed. In the 1980s, a new breed of student politician emerged. True, those student politicians still suffered from their own forms of undergraduate self-indulgence. Rather than reading Gramsci, they liked to quote von Hayek. But on many campuses they made a real impact. They won control of student unions. Once students were no longer funding the pet campaigns of the leftovers from the 1960s who had decided that free education meant they could spend their lives as activists, they significantly reduced union fees. When the Left howled over the introduction of a $200 government administration fee in 1987, many campuses the Left ran were forcing students to pay a higher union fee. Liberal and even moderate ALP students were able to make a real difference in student union administration. I use this example because there is no real reason for them not to keep doing so and because there is no need for the federal government to be interfering in student politics. The government has spoken about the importance of student unionism. The only problem is that the vast majority of students see no need even to vote in student elections, let alone get involved. At the University of Adelaide, between 15 and 20 per cent tum out for student elections. That is the best in the state. At Flinders and the University of South Australia, less than 10 per cent vote. With such little support, it makes it very hard for student unions legitimately to launch any great ideological campaign. They scarcely represent the wishes of their great body of members. In fact, it is ironic to note that the people who have favoured big spending, expensive student unions, are the ones who constantly call for lower HECS or free education. Instead, students have been concerned with finishing their studies and basic amenities like refectories. They have not been interested in ideological self-indulgence, no matter what side of the political fence it comes from. Because of this, students have not been interested in VSU. I believe it is important to fight the idiot Left on campuses, but I also believe too much of our energy in the education debate has been spent on VSU and not on some of the issues that really affect tertiary students like the quality of amenities and standards of education. Liberals have already shown that they can succeed in campuses on their merits. They can provide the day-today services students really need and want and cut their fees or even make their union self-supporting through better management and through letting salon Sandinistas find their own funds. They should work to win and hold campuses by showing the great majority of non-political students just that. I have no complaint about state governments legislating for VSU. The federal party has decided that this is a choice that it is up to them to make. But I believe there is no reason for the federal government to be involved in student politics. In fact, the only reason I can see for the government acting on this matter is to give the minister a chance to send a big thankyou to his friends in the National Union of Students. NUS has failed entirely as a lobby group. The only things it has delivered are falling standards and rising fees. The union has campaigned hard and long on behalf of this government. It did wonders on campuses at the time of the last federal election, so it is not surprising the government wants to help it all it can. Last year, I spoke at a rally in Adelaide condemning the government's tertiary fee changes. Similar rallies did not take place in most other capital cities. In those states, the local NUS people did not want to ruin their chances of an ALP career, either in parliament or on staff. In fact, NUS headquarters in Carlton looks like a meeting of NOLS, the National Organisation of Labor Students. This bill represents a crude effort to prop up sympathetic student unions, or at least student organisations that will attack the Liberal Party. The government claims it is defending student rights. It is actually doing the opposite. This is an essentially undemocratic intervention in student politics. This bill will pay for political activities in which the overwhelming majority of students are totally uninterested. Student leaders who support it are entirely compromising their positions. They are selling out to the government. This week, the opposition has been highlighting just what the government's education policies mean for students. We have been pointing out what its record has really been. The government has liked to trumpet the importance of tertiary education but, at the same time, it has failed to make sure that it is properly funded. Since 1983, the financial support provided for each full-time student has fallen by some 16 per cent. The government has liked to portray itself as the champion of accessible education, but not only has it created the means for universities to seek more funds through the charging of fees but also its own funding cuts have created a need for such fees. Tertiary institutions across Australia, like the ANU, are now charging fees in an increasing range of courses. They are doing it out of necessity and with the full support of the government. The student unions which hope to benefit from this legislation certainly have strange tastes in bedfellows. The government's guidelines for the 1994-96 funding triennium put the position clearly. The guidelines read: The regulation of arrangements for fee paying postgraduate courses will be considerably relaxed ... Higher education institutions will be free to charge fees for both course work and research degrees and the level of fees charged will not be regulated. Postgraduate training that is required registration for professional practice will not be protected. With a policy like that, no wonder the government has to try to buy the silence of students. Unfortunately, it seems as if it will succeed. As I said earlier, when it comes to the crunch, the government's mates in NUS will try their hardest to cover up its record. Higher education in Australia is in a state of crisis. Demand for places is at record levels. Student numbers have increased dramatically but funding has been substantially reduced. Resources are becoming increasingly limited, and institutions often lack the necessary funding to maintain quality of education and restore run-down university infrastructure. But I am sure NUS will want to please the government. It will claim that life under the Liberals will be worse. Of course, under this legislation, it will be doing this with public money, since the bill allows the Commonwealth to make direct payments to student organisations for political use. It is absolutely shameful that a government should even suggest that taxpayer funds should be used to fund student political activities at the expense of better roads, schools and hospitals, let alone put into legislation. It is also a clear indication of the complete fiscal irresponsibility of the Australian Democrats when we hear of their support for this legislation. If we go outside this place, we will probably find that the biggest political issue concerning ordinary Australians is the drought. But today the government is saying we have an urgent need to hand out public money to prop up student unions. That is a very strange sense of priorities. Student unionism is scarcely a matter of national importance. Those of us who have played student politics know its significance is limited. It probably does provide some training for future political life, but virtually alI of it is very petty and of interest only to the editors of student newspapers, which on so many campuses today, are like student politicians themselves-totally ignored by most students. That is what makes this legislation so for entirely preposterous. The idea of reducing general purpose grants to states that legislate for voluntary student unionism to fund student politicians should be a cause for public outrage. It is pointlessly provocative and wasteful. It is the type of idiotic self-indulgence and brinkmanship we expect from student politicians themselves. Recently, the University of South Australia students association was forced to pulp an entire edition of its newspaper after a dubious and obscene attempt at humour resulted in threats of a libel action. If South Australia had had VSU and this legislation had been in operation, taxpayers would have footed the bill for that issue of the magazine. But they would not have just paid for a foolish and expensive failed joke; they would have paid for the magazine at the expense of basic services. Money that should have gone to the state government for better schools, roads and hospitals would have been paid directly to the student union. My colleague the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) raised another example of such idiotic expense in his remarks earlier. Student unions and student policies are scarcely causes to die for. It is ridiculous to hand out public money to fund student newspapers, magazines, campus elections and political campaigns. The only people interested in these things are university faction hacks. They are irrelevant to most students. We should totally reject this bill, leave student politics to student politicians and get on with discussing serious business in this place.",50
21,Mr ABBOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"It is very interesting that there have been so few government speakers in this debate on the Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill 1994. It is not really surprising. Government members should be utterly embarrassed by this bill, because this bill will take money away from the state governments providing schools, hospitals, roads and welfare measures and put it instead into the hands of student politicians. What this bill is about is taking money from taxpayers, taking money away from the services which every Australian deserves and needs and putting that money into the hands of largely irresponsible student politicians. Let us look at what these student unions do-these unions which the government is so anxious to subsidise at the expense of schools, roads and hospitals. At Melbourne University the student union has recently spent $20,000 attacking the policy of the democratically elected state government, but that is only the beginning of the sorts of things that these unions do. The Melbourne University student union has recently spent money-which, under the government's legislation, will be taxpayers' money soon-to defend the so called Austudy Five, who were engaged in a violent demonstration against the policies of the federal government. The Melbourne University student union gave $500 towards the general expenses of these people and $200 towards their travel costs in going to Sydney to engage in a violent demonstration against the policies of the democratically elected government. That is not the end of the kind of waste, extravagance and nonsense which we see from these student unions. Another student union, this time in the north of the country, gave $44,000-none of which was recovered-to a Bob Geldof concert. So what we are going to have under this legislation of the government is WA Inc., Victoria Inc. and South Australia Inc. translated to student unions. We will have Labor's future politicians learning how to waste taxpayers' money on campus, as they have wasted taxpayers' money in so many governments around this country. Some of my colleagues have mentioned the sort of thing which goes into the student newspapers-which, under this legislation, will be subsidised by the taxpayer of Australia. We have had one example of a student newspaper that put on its cover a sexually grotesque effigy of Jesus Christ. I remember from my own days on campus that the newspaper Honi Soit on its front cover contained an announcement that the contents would include instructions on how to make an atomic bomb. Do not think that it is all on one side. I also recall from my days in student politics one particular student magazine pledging homage, in most extravagant terms, to Her Majesty the Queen. The point is that none of this should be subsidised by the taxpayer, as it will be under the legislation which the government is bringing forward. But apart from all these other things which student unions do, which may perhaps be dismissed as youthful extravagance and frippery, the thing student unions do which this government is most concerned about is donate money to the National Union of Students. The National Union of Students in the last federal election campaign gave $100,000 to the federal ALP, so what we are seeing here is really a giant money laundering exercise. It is a way of taking the money of taxpayers-the money of ordinary Australians-and putting it in the coffers of the Australian Labor Party. It is diverting money into the coffers of the Labor Party. It is misusing money for directly political purposes. It is washing money from the taxpayers' pockets into the coffers of the Labor Party via these student unions. My colleague the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) talked about the romper stomper attitude of the Labor Party. Is it not appropriate that it should be so interested in the romper room politics of the campus? This is where it is getting some of its money from. Let me remind the government of something which should be very much in its thoughts at the present time: the United Nations sponsored Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Let me remind the government that article 20 states: Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. It goes on to say: No one may be compelled to belong to an associadefend tion. This is why there are so few Labor speakers in this debate. The Labor Party is utterly ashamed that this legislation goes directly against article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. If the ALP is going to rely on these United Nations conventions and treaties and declarations, it cannot be selective. If it believes in these rights, it believes in all of them. It cannot go around saying, 'WeB, yes, that's one that we will try to enforce; that's one that we won't have enforced at all.' The fact is, if you believe in these things, if you want to use these things as political manifestos in this country, either you have them all or you do not worry about them. This piece of legislation directly contlicts with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which surely should be something which members opposite hold dear. I have heard speakers on the other side claim in this debate that we on this side are against the bill not because we are against compulsory student unionism but because we are against compulsory student unionism when we cannot control what goes on. It is true that quite a lot of people from the school of student politics have gone on to serve on the other side of the various houses of parliament in this country. The member for Cowan mentioned people like David Parker. But I have to say that student politics has produced a lot of different graduates. A lot of people have come out of the school of student politics-people like the member for Higgins (Mr Costello); people like Michael Yabsley, a former minister in the New South Wales state parliament; people like Eric Abetz, now a senator in this parliament; people, indeed, like the present member for Warringah. The fact is that when we were in student politics, when we were running these organisations, we were campaigning for this very principle, because it is a fundamental belief of people on this side of parliament that no-one should be compelled to belong to an association. It is interesting, when you consider just what these student unions actually comprise, that the government should be rushing off to them. It is typical, as my colleague the  less than 20 per cent of eligible students will vote in elections for these bodies. In fact, the numbers of people supporting the sorts of people that this government now wants to subsidise with taxpayers' money are small. Let us face it: most of these organisations could hold their meetings in a public telephone booth-and these are the sorts of people that the government wants to subsidise with taxpayers' money. On this side of the House, what we want to do is very sensible; it is what some Liberal governments are doing. We want to divide up these organisations. We want to take the service component and we want to separate that from the political component. We want to take the catering function, the travel function and the sporting function which are currently performed to some extent by these bodies and to separate them from the political function: the function of putting out student newspapers and the function of campaigning and subsidising political campaigns for partisan purposes. If this happens, the catering, the sporting and the travel side of things will be done better because the people who are interested in that will be able to get on with the job, undistracted by partisan politics. Honourable members opposite have spoken about the great tradition of debate in our universities. Our universities do have a great tradition of debate. Our position is that that debate should be done by students for students in students' own time and with students' own money and not with taxpayers' money. It should be done with money that the students give voluntarily to these bodies, not with money that is compulsorily levied and certainly not with money from the taxpayer to fill the breach if students themselves are not prepared to give. The legislation of the Kennett government provides that, if students want to be part of these bodies and if they want to support their activities, they are perfectly free to do so. What is going to happen under this government's legislation is that the more they opt out of supporting these bodies, the more taxpayer money these people will get. The more people opt out of these student unions, the more taxpayers' money is going to be poured into those selfsame union coffers. In other words, this government is subsidising incompetence. The wackier these student bodies are, the sillier the causes they adopt, the more way-out and irrelevant the moneys that they commit, the more likely they arethe more certain they are-to get taxpayer funding from this government. What an opportunity for rackets and rorts and rip-offs! What a marvellous opportunity for unscrupulous people to rip off the taxpayers of Australia! Now that this government has given, in effect, a blank cheque to the student radicals of this country, you can just imagine what they are going to do. First of all, they are going to raise their fees. SecondI ly, there will not be any brake on the sort of thing that they do. They will be utterly shameless because they know that the government is going to come to their rescue. As an Australian, I am absolutely appalled by this kind of activity but, as a partisan of the Liberal Party, I am rather amused in a sense because what it means is that untold scandals are going to be sheeted home to this government. This government, if it had thought this through, would not have a bar of this legislation, because it would realise that the wackiest ideas in this country would soon be funded by this legislation and therefore would be attributed to this government. I guess this legislation is symptomatic of very sad development. This legislation is symptomatic of the decline of the once great Labor Party. As we know, the universities are attended preponderantly by the children of the middle class. As we know, the universities will produce the high income earners of tomorrow. As we know, the universities are mechanisms which basically benefit the better off sections of society. I am not criticising that; I am just stating it as a fact. What is this government doing? It is robbing the poor to pay the rich. It is taking money out of the hands of the generality of taxpayers to subsidise these silly indulgences of the children of the rich. That is what this government is doing with this bill. Kim Beazley Sr famously commented that, when he joined the Labor Party, it was the cream of the working class. When he left the Labor Party, he said it had become the dregs of the middle class. This sort of legislation epitomises just how far the once great Labor Party has fallen.",56
22,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"O'Connor) (1.25 p.m.)This particular legislation is a milestone in legislation coming before this parliament. I do not believe we have ever seen a government of any political colour decide to so openly fund an association or a union. We know that the government sends the money, but to create a circumstance in legislation which obliges the taxpayers of Australia to fund a particular political activity is, I think, unique. do not think we could find a similar example where a blanket contribution was made. I have been listening to many of the arguments put forward but I might also add, for the interest of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), that I have the explanatory memorandum and I have never really read one that is so blatantly in the form of a second reading speech. Rather than describe the purposes and the functions of the bill to members, it promotes the arguments for its existence. I would ask the minister that he and the cabinet look more closely at this particular situation in the preparation of an explanatory memorandum. We have always accepted that the second a reading speech is a political document, putting the government's arguments for the particular legislation before the House but, on this occasion, the explanatory memorandum is more of a second reading speech. This is quite noticeable in arguments such as: The Victorian act purports to abolish compulsory student unionism while protecting the provision of specified services to. students. W-i1e the pro-isi-ns of this act were being debated In the Legislative Assembly, amendments were made, after considerable pressure . . . What has that got to do with explaining an act? It goes on: For example, a number of activities and services such as student newspapers, student advocacy and general activities of a representational nature will not be provided for. Why are we having that sort of argument put for us in an explanatory memorandum? The explanatory memorandum, as I understand it, is to explain how the bill will operate and not to put forward a second reading speech. I condemn that particular development in the operations of this place because I do not think it is appropriate. Furthermore and nevertheless, the explanatory memorandum does start to draw out what this legislation is all about. For many years within our academic institutions, our tertiary institutions, where one would think that freedom of the individual was a paramount principle, there has been a compulsory levy. The levy has not been directly associated with the learning for which students attend that institution but has provided all sorts of little extras that somebody thought the students should have-not for a minute what the students themselves might have thought was necessary for them to gain an education. The compulsory levy, to the best of my knowledge, was never directed to assisting the tutors, the professors and the other educationalists to better do their job; that has always been funded quite properly and separately. The sorts of services that are referred to are the availability of a cafeteria or a bar. Of course, if one were in the Temperance Le-gue one would wonder why one should be obhged to fund a bar by this most outrageous process within the academic institutions. In fact, when governments tried to persuade the chancellor and his colleagues not to make this levy compulsory, they simply said, 'You can stop us but we simply will not mark the examination papers of the students who do not pay.' I just wonder how Hitler would have responded in those sorts of circumstances, but I have to say that he would have responded in a very similar way. I find it outrageous that the senior academics of these particular institutions could take that attitude. They never asked themselves the fundamental question of whether the students could afford the money. There was a time when all students leaving secondary institutions were 17or 18-yearolds. Today, many students are mature age students with a family, and every penny counts. In talking to people within my particular area of responsibility the other day, and in talking to the federation that represents the interests of servicemen, I had raised with me the issue of a serviceman who wrote in and said, 'I am dedicated to what you are doing for us, but I literally cannot afford the $104. Do you mind if I don't remain a member this year?' That federation, being more democratic than our academic tertiary institutions, accepted that but brought it to - y attention as an example of how poorly paid the lower ranks in our services are. That is an issue that the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), and I are showing great concern about; and we are investigating that to try to find solutions. There is a student protest going on in this town today; students are protesting about the additional fees that are required of them. While some of them are playing that for the politics and can afford the fee, there is another group who genuinely cannot afford the fee. The first question that should be asked when these compulsory levies are introduced is this: can the people afford to pay? The other question that should be asked, and it is certainly as big as the first one, is this: do the people who attend university want the service or are they likely to use it? Of course, people go along with things. Today I heard someone say, 'If you don't watch out, the catering will be taken over by MCDonald's.' I guess that comment was intended to suggest that that is unhealthy. Mr Beddall-And cheaper.",58
23,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"In fact, it would be cheaper for many students, as the minister points out. Perhaps that is one of the solutions available. But any suggestion that the type of catering available on university campuses would cater for the needs of a variety of people who attend there is ridiculous. In fact, from my observation, campus catering services tend to function very much like a MCDonald's. There are people attending campuses who have religious dietary requirements. There are people with dietary requirements that a cafeteria or a public dining room would not be able to cater for. I know a bit about the food business, and it would not be possible to offer that diversity. However, those people are told, 'You will pay, even though we know your religion prevents you from using the facility.' We have the situation where those who do not drink are provided with a bar at their compulsory cost, those who have special religious requirements in food are obliged to pay for a facility that they cannot use, et cetera. But of course students are told, 'We have provided all of this sporting equipment for you.' What if they do not participate in ball games? If I were a mature age student-a very mature age student, I might add-why should I have to pay for somebody's tennis balls or any of those facilities? I am very supportive of sport and I think that people have a right of access to sport; but surely they should, as people do if they join the local suburban tennis club, pay a membership fee to cover those costs. Why should those who are up to their eyeballs with academic responsibilities and who have no time for sport be forced to pay for it? These are fundamental questions. The Victorians have apparently responded to this, but this is not what the Victorians are addressing. They certainly should be. We should remove the compulsion. That is the word that we object to. We stand up here claiming that we are a free society, yet we support a mechanism that demands that people pay money for a series of services and some political representation that they simply do not use. I heard the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) quoting some voting statistics relevant to the student union. I think he mentioned that on one occasion the vote was three per cent. People do not want the representation of these radicals. One must remember that these people get substantial privileges by their election. They get special parking bays when all of the other kids have to walk half a mile to get into the university. The guild president gets his own nominated parking bay. That is as un-Australian as underarm bowling. Dr Kemp-Not to mention salaries.",59
24,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Of course, they are well paid while they are at university. They get all of this, yet there is so little interest from the rank and file of the student body that they can rustle up only a three per cent vote. I think it was the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) who bemoaned the loss of the student newspaper. He admits that he does not agree with everything that is written in it but states that there has to be a student newspaper. Can someone identify to me any other newspaper printed in Australia which I must buy as a matter of compulsion-a newspaper that I have got to buy, whether I like its views or not? Hell's bells, I do not know of any. The question is not whether there should or there should not be a student newspaper. The question is whether people who do not want to read it should be made to pay for it. Because Liberal governments apply liberalism as it is properly understood-in other words, as the right of people to choose whether or not they make contributions of this nature-state Liberal governments are saying, 'No more compulsion.' Here we are, debating a piece of legislation which says, 'Well, okay, we accept your constitutional and legal right to do that. But, because of our own philosophical view, we will put that compulsion on all Australian taxpayers.' It is ludicrous to think we are standing here telling Australian taxpayers that, whether they like it or not, they will compulsorily fund a student newspaper whose only use to them-and they are not going to get one, even having funded itmight be to light the barbecue. That is what this bill is about. It raises another very substantial point on which the bill seems to be quite deficient. It does not tell me what prudential requirements apply to the management of taxpayers' money on the university campus. There is no doubt that one of the major criticisms coming from students over the years has been criticism of the management of their money. Many objected to donations that were made by some of these student union bodies to Libya and other radical and terrorist regimes. But who is going to say? I think one of the large embarrassments that the government is going to suffer in the future will arise when there is a scandal in one of the universities as to how this money which they are forcing Australian taxpayers to provide is being spent. It might not be a bad idea for the minister at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), in responding to this speech, to simply tell us what measures are going to be in place. Is the Auditor-General going to go out and audit these things? If he is, is that the proper use of the resources of government? If you do not give them the money, you do not have to audit it. The Auditor-General seems busy enough chasing around a few other things. What is more, he has now got to pay rent to the ALP at an exorbitant level. He probably needs the money. These are some of the issues that should be addressed when the government makes these silly decisions because it has got a few little activists out there who think they have a right to the public's money, be it students' or taxpayers' money. They have not. As I say of the trade union movement in general, if they are so good, the money will flood in and the members will be queuing up at the door. They know they are not good. They know they are not wanted. I do not care whether it is the so called facilities or the so-called political representation. There is nothing in the standards that I apply to Australia that should make it compulsory, be it through the union or through the Commissioner of Taxation. I also rise because during the debate to date the member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) chose, in typical style, to impose a little bit of the Goebbelist principle. I want to respond to what he had to say. There is no doubt about it. The Hansard will substantiate my remarks. In the middle of a speech which I thought was on these issues he threw in a line to say that the past president of the Liberal Party had written a letter to the DPP in Victoria demanding that he desist in a particular prosecution. I think he was trying to make a tenuous link with the Victorian government. The clear unstated inference was that the Attorney General in Victoria complied with that request. I will not speak any more about it other than to say that the action is in the courts at the moment, which is pretty clear evidence the A-G down there did not respond to that letter. I do not know if there is something wrong with writing letters to members of parliament, . or if an automatic linkage can be made that those members are at fault because the letter turned up in their mail. If that is the case, I am in trouble, because I keep getting letters that tell me someone should shoot Paul Keating. I do not take any notice of them, and I do not even respond. The Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) has made an art form of those snide little throwaway Goebbelistic lines. Generally nobody picks up those nice little snide lines, but if people keep telling a lie often enough it becomes the truth. I condemn the member for his remark. I am astounded that the occupant of the Chair at the time did not ask him to withdraw it, because it was totally unrelated. It was not relevant; but, worse, it was done with malicious intent. I invite him to come back and tell us why he said it. If he wants to discuss those issues I would like the time to run him through some of the things that have happened in the courts of Western Australia. They have happened, and are no longer sub judice because people are in gaol: people like David Parker and Brian Burke. The Minister for Finance, who comes in here and makes these snide remarks, actually rewrites what people have said. Mr Snowdon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.",60
25,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"We are getting a little irrelevant, are we? Mr Snowdon-This bill is about higher education. It has absolutely nothing to do with what the opposition member is speaking about. I ask that he be brought back to the issue at hand.",61
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,The debate has been broad right through the debate on this bill. There is no point of order.,62
27,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let me put something to you. You might tell the member for MCEwen that if he wants to start these sorts of things in his slimy way this is the sort of response he will get. The simple facts are that in recent times we have seen a number of instances where premiers and deputy premiers of Labor governments have been locked up for criminal activity. While I am on that, and while we are chucking these insinuations about, let me just say this. Both of them-Burke and Parkerwent into the court and said, 'Yes, I spent this money.' Mr Snowdon- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: talking about these activities has got absolutely nothing to do with this legislation. Not one bit. Even accepting the proposition that it has been a wide-ranging debate, this contribution is totally irrelevant.",62
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,The member will confine his remarks to the bill.,62
29,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"In finalising my response to the remarks of the member for MCEwen, let me just point out this one simple fact, because he seems to have a concern that people might make improper suggestions to members of parliament from time to time. The improper suggestion I am referring to is money-money paid to members of parliament, who generally believed it was their money. It follows that that is a bribe. Of course, the donors were quick to tell the royal commission that they donated to the ALP. They saw what happened to some people in Queensland who were caught out giving money to members of parliament. I do not condone that either. I am not like you blokes. You try to say something is right because someone on the other side did it. I do not. I say it is wrong whoever did it. But what I am telling you, in the simplest of terms, is that your colleagues over there took the money and they did think they had the right to spend it. They got convicted of stealing ALP funds when they knew very well what they were doing. It is no joke that Parker was the Deputy Premier and Treasurer and took Holmes a Court's money, and Holmes a Court walked in and got $800 million from a state government entity. The people of Western Australia, your voters, are now paying $50 on every licence to try to repay that money. It is outrageous. It was no joke that he was so friendly with Holmes a Court, took his money and spent his money. It is very obvious why the SGIC, with $64 million worth of assets, was told to payout $800 million to an entrepreneur who could not flog his assets anywhere else in Australia because the market had crashed; and you put his wife on the Reserve Bank board. (Time expired)",62
30,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (l.45 p.m.)-in reply-I would like to make some observations about contributions which have been made by a number of our friends from the opposition. I heard the previous speaker, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), talk about Goebbels. If ever I have heard a speech which was full of fatuous and gratuitous advice and false assertions the speech made by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) was one. He described this piece of legislation as being about corruption and theft. You are nodding your head in affirmation. Do you accept it is about corruption and theft? His exact words were, 'This bill is about corruption and theft.' He stands condemned by those words, yet the member for O'Connor stood up and, in his own gratuitous way, attacked a member on our side of the parliament for raising particular issues. I ask you: if he is fair dinkum, does he accept the proposition that the allegations made by the member for Stirling were completely out of order?",62
31,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,I did not hear the member for Stirling.,62
32,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The allegations were very simple. I will repeat them: 'This bill is about corruption and theft and is despicable.' They were made without substantiation. Your side is forever coming into this place and blandly making assertions about corruption with not one shred of evidence, and you expect these propositions to be copped by the Australian community. The shadow minister, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), nods his head in affirmation. Dr Kemp-I asked a question.",62
33,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,I have answered the question. Do you support the statements you made?,63
34,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Order! The parliamentary secretary will address his remarks through the chair.,63
35,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I find it quite remarkable that the shadow minister can sit here at the table and support those assertions about this piece of legislation. What is he saying? Is he saying that all student unions in Australia, or particular student guilds, or particular individuals and student guilds, or particular universities, or vice-chancellors, are corrupt? Is that what he is saying? If he wants to make those assertions, why does he not bring them into this House and table them? If he thinks there has been illegal activity, why does he not go to the police? There has been no attempt by those on the other side to substantiate these allegations. They use this parliament all the time for these sorts of approaches. They are not content with addressing the issues. They come in here in a way which is completely despicable, and indeed un-Australian, and make these grandiose assertions which have absolutely no foundation. People have to ask themselves: to what depths will members of the opposition sink? This debate has epitomised the depths to which they are prepared to sink. The member for Stirling, who stands up and makes these gratuitous statements, stands condemned. I suggest to them that, if they want to make these allegations, they had better be sure of their grounds. Given the tawdry state of the opposition at present, the impression given by the opposition, including the shadow minister, is not surprising. Notwithstanding what the opposition is proposing, this bill seeks to maintain the status quo. It seeks to maintain the democratic rights and freedoms of association and freedom of speech that students currently enjoynothing more and nothing less. The opposition is seeking to take away these particular rights. It is the Victorian, Tasmanian and Western Australian governments who are seeking to remove these rights. Let us be clear about it. It is those state governments which are seeking to remove those rights. It is hypocritical although not surprising that the opposition is against this legislation. We have the member for Goldstein arguing that the Commonwealth inter-. feres in the autonomy of institutions, yet here we have him supporting a piece of legislation for Victoria which is seeking to prevent an institution from receiving funds for transmission to student organisations. So what is he supporting? On the one hand, he says governments interfere too much; on the other hand, he says he wants to support a piece of legislation which validates the interference of the Victorian government in the affairs of the university and its students. Contrary to the assertion of the opposition, compulsory student unionism is not a contravention of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and legal advice supports this. The opposition claims that the legislation is forcing the costs on the taxpayers. A number of members from the opposition including the member for Stirling, the person about whom I have spoken previously, the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) and the  legislation will take away funding for state essential services such as hospitals, schools, police and roads. They know that is not true. It is within the province of the state governments to exercise their rights but, at the same time, they need to understand that this government believes that students should pay for their student organisations and this is what they do at the moment. That should not come as a surprise to the shadow minister if he was aware of the content of this legislation and of what happens at university campuses around Australia at this moment. The actions of the Victorian government are preventing this. It is refusing to allow universities to collect student organisation fees from the students. The opposition argues that the student organisation fees should be voluntary. It also knows, or it should know, that there have always been avenues for conscientious objections from students so that they can choose not to join. This biIl is not, as the opposition pretends, about guaranteeing income for students so that the government does not have to worry about them. It is not about buying the silence of students, as the member for Sturt claims. I can recall my days at university. They are in the long distant past, but I vividly remember my involvement with student unions and student politics. I cannot think of one occasion on which we went out to support the government of the day. Whilst it is understandable that the opposition should be concerned about its support amongst the student community for its policies, or should not be concerned about is the fact that students should actually have political views and involve themselves in political activity. If the opposition were aware and fully cognisant and supported the rights of full participation in a democracy, it would be saying, 'Go right ahead; let us encourage it.' Because it believes that, somehow or other, there is a connection between student unions and the Australian Labor Party or other nefarious political organisations, what it is saying is that we should not allow these unions or these guilds to operate. That is the logic of its position and it is completely unsustainable. It is a fundamental right for students to be critical of the government and the opposition and it is of key importance that critical thinking should be developed and encouraged in our universities and other educational institutions. Let us understand who opposes this proposal. The people who are opposing the government's legislation are the conservative state governments around Australia and the opposition-not the universities, not the student guilds, not the unions relevant to the higher education institutions but the opposition. Why is the opposition opposed to it? Its mate, Jeff Kennett, the Premier of Victoria, has decided he wants to take a stick to students. The people of Victoria are fed up to the back teeth with the way in which they have been treated by the Kennett government over education matters. Students have the temerity to demonstrate their opposition to the Victorian government and perhaps to use their own organisational skills and their own resources, which they properly have as a result of their association with these universities, to organise against the Victorian government so the way to stop them is to silence them. The opposition will not allow them to operate. It will just tum them off. That is the approach which is being advanced by the opposition and it is the sort of approach which is not acceptable to the Australian community. I might point out that in a policy paper released by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee on 26 April student organisations lack of, what it are described as: . .. not only providing essential services and facilities but also are an important element in the social and cultural aspects of universities and are part of the education process. They encourage a broad range of activities by funding diverse groups, ranging from religious societies to faculty associations to debating clubs. Participation in these activities is educational in the broadest sense, encouraging students to develop their social skills. Perhaps important, you would think, even for the opposition. The paper continues: Student organisations also promote a wide range of sporting activities and provide recreational facilities for the student community. Of course, the student organisations also lobby for the rights and welfare of students more generally, and they should be supported for doing that. The NUS, the National Union of Students, acts as a national voice for students and should be acknowledged for doing so. But, of course, we cannot have the NUS, as it might at various times, choosing to oppose the opposition; if they are seen to oppose the opposition, we should silence them! That is the answer: shut them up; do not allow them to operate! We had the member for O'Connor talking about Goebbels. If we are talking about fascist activity, this about takes the cake. I point out to members opposite that they continue to claim that somehow or other the NUS is stacked by Labor stooges. I do not know how we are supposed to operate this organisation. Most members opposite themselves at some stage or another were university students. Are they suggesting that there is some fifth column of the Labor Party in universities? What are they saying about the rights of people to have opinions of their own? What are they saying about the rights of individuals to organise? What I read into this opposition and the will of the Victorian, Tasmanian and Western Australian governments is that they oppose those rights. They do not like people to be different; they want people to think the same as them. If people do not think the same as them, do not let them operate. I point out to honourable members opposite, in case they had not realised it-and I suspect that the shadow minister has not realised itthat the NUS has been demonstrating against the Labor government even as late as last week. It lobbied hard in the lead-up to the budget and we expect it to lobby hard in the lead-up to the next budget. It is lobbying now against possible introduction of increased costs for students, against up-front fees and possible changes to HECS. Indeed, in my own electorate there was a demonstration outside my office late last week. I did not get the police and say, 'Listen, shoo these people away, lock them up, close them down.' They had a legitimate right to demonstrate for their views; they had a legitimate right to be In fact, my response on radio was to encourage them in that activity, because that is what they should be doing, expressing views, having opinions and making sure that they are heard. They are also currently demonstrating against the university administration and the government of the ANU. In the course of my consideration of this demonstration last week in Darwin, I actually recalled quite vividly a similar occupation of the chancellery building here at ANU when I was a student. That was 1973. Perhaps I am divulging something which I should not divulge. I can recall the occupation of the chancellery and I participatThings ed in that activity. It was not some wicked act, we were not anarchists, we were not bomb-throwers or terrorists. The seats were marginally more comfortable than the ones we were sitting on in the lecture theatres. What we were doing was demonstrating, as we thought was our right and was seen to be our right by the university, and as is being accepted by this university, the ANU, as the right of the students here in Australia today. We were demonstrating because we wanted to make a point about a range of important educational issues, exactly as students were doing last week, however misguided they might have been in their views. I guess this is really at the heart of it:· members of the opposition do not want students to understand, have a view or express a view about opposition policy. I do not blame the opposition, because it would be exposed as not having a policy. If it has one, it has not articulated it, and the only response that students can make to the opposition is, 'We recall your policies prior to the last election. We recall the proposals for vouchers and for full fees.' There is no indication if there is another policy, if there is a new policy or if the opposition has resiled from this policy. What is the opposition's policy? Does it have a policy? It has an opposition leader who certainly does not know where he is, so I suspect he does not know what his policies are. But I imagine that, at the appropriate time, he will pull one out of his back pocket and demonstrate it, perhaps to people heard. in business. He will then go around, be confronted by a group of students who oppose him-and he will pull out a different policy, because that has been his form to date. I do not expect it will change in the near future. The member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) likened the government to a sly fox. I have already remonstrated with the member for Stirling. The government has stood by its commitments to students, has been up-front about its policies and is consulting with students. But what can the opposition tell students around Australia? Really, I do not need to talk in depth about a document that has sunk without trace but, in launching The That Matter at the National Press Club, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) indicated that the opposition will be encouraging education institutions to look to 'new and creative ways of attracting funds from the private sector'. That is what we know about the opposition's higher education policy. According to Senator Hill, on 2CN on 15 September, we will have to wait until the next election before the details of these innovative ways of raising money are obtained. Is it any wonder that people in the community, including students at universities and other institutions, might query what the opposition's policies really are? The member for Warringah made an outrageous claim that this bill is a way of redirecting funds from students into the Labor Party coffers. This is untrue, and the honourable member and other members of the opposition would be well advised to check the facts. The National Union of Students did not make a financial contribution to the ALP during the last election, very contrary to the article published by Padraic MCGuiness in the Australian of 30 June. These assertions are incorrect; they are without foundation. For the information of the members opposite, the National Union of Students has instructed its solicitors to issue a defamation suit against Nationwide News Pty Ltd, the publishers of the Australian and Mr MCGuiness. So I suggest to the member for Warringah that, when talking about this issue, people should think very carefully about what they say outside of this parliament. We can expect that they will repeat those sorts of allegations in this place because they use it as a cowards' castle, as I said earlier in my speech. They are prepared to make outrageous claims, assertions and defame individuals or organisations without any substantiation and use this parliament as a protection-the protection of privilege. Yet they will not walk out of the shelter of this parliament to make those allegations in public because they know that when they do-if they were able to, if they were game to, if they had the guts toinevitably they would be in the courts. It is a pity that the members of the opposi- Kelly, R. 1. tion similarly have not taken the time to check the facts in this case instead of building their case on lies and scaremongering. This government stands on its record. It is strongly opposed to the introduction of up-front fees for undergraduate courses, and it has made a strong commitment to the HECS scheme. Total Commonwealth funding on higher education will have increased from $3 billion in 1983 to $4.8 billion in 1995. The opposition is strong on criticism but not on policy. It has not given us any reasons why this bill should not progress through this House and through this parliament. The opposition has relied on false accusations and defamation, essentially, of groups and individuals who are outside of this place. The opposition has no substance to its allegations. Those opposite know that they cannot prove those false allegations and they should be condemned for them. (TIme expired) Question put: That the bill be now read a second time. The House divided.

36,Mr DUNCAN,NOES INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The International War Crimes Tribunal Bill was introduced on 30 May 1994 after passing through the Senate with minor amendments. Moore, J. C. It was then referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The committee reported on 30 June 1994 and recommended that the bills be passed by the House after the incorporation of some amendments. A government response to the committee's report has been tabled and government amendments will be moved later today. The purpose of the bill is to enable Australia to comply with binding international obligations which were imposed by the NA United Nations Security Council on 25 May 1993, when it adopted resolution 827. That resolution established the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia Since 1991, and adopted the statute of the international tribunal. The decision to establish the tribunal as an enforcement measure under chapter VII of the United Nations Charter created, from 25 May 1993, an immediately binding obligation on UN member states, including Australia, to take whatever action necessary to implement the Security Council's decision and to meet the obligations imposed under the statute of the international tribunal. It is obviously desirable that Australia should be in a position to comply with requests for cooperation with the tribunal as soon as they are received, and it is therefore important to have the legislation enacted as soon as possible. The statute imposes obligations on member states 'to cooperate with the international tribunal in the investigation and prosecution' of accused persons and to comply 'with any request for assistance or an order issued by a Trial Chamber'. Such requests may involve, among other things, the identification and location of persons, the taking of testimony and the production of evidence, the service of documents, the arrest and detention of persons, and the surrender of accused persons to the tribunal. The bill contains provisions enabling Australia to comply with these international obligations. It specifically provides for the handing over of accused persons to the tribunal for trial; other forms of assistance to enable cooperation with the tribunal in the investigation and prosecution of alleged offenders; the recovery and return of property and proceeds of crime located within Australia; and the tribunal to sit in Australia if it desires. The aim was to keep the legislation as simple as possible, while still enabling us to meet our international obligations. The bill adopts a minimalist approach, providing only for the mandatory obligations imposed by the statute. It was originally intended that the bill would also provide for imprisonment in Australia of persons convicted by the tribunal. We have been consulting with the states and territories on this issue, as any persons will need to be imprisoned in state and territory prisons. The matter has not been included in the bill because not all states and territories have responded on this issue, and imprisonment within Australia is not a mandatory obligation under the statute. However, I recognise that it may be desirable to amend the legislation at an appropriate time, for example, when all the states and territories have responded, and if the tribunal commences proceedings against Australian citizens. I now mention some important features of the bill. Part 3 of the bill covers the surrender aspect of our obligations. The statute requires countries to 'comply without undue delay with any request for assistance or an order issued by a Trial Chamber, including ... the surrender or the transfer of the accused to the International Tribunal.' Although the Extradition Act 1988 was used as a general model for Part 3 of the bill, the bill departs from that act in a number of ways because of the different circumstances and purposes of the legislation. In this case, Australia has binding international obligations to comply with requests for assistance by the tribunal, and as a result the mechanism for handing over of persons to the tribunal is more streamlined and has less grounds of refusal than under the Extradition Act. The reason for this different approach stems from the unique nature of our international obligations. One way in which this case differs from usual extradition situations is that the obligation to transfer accused persons to the tribunal is derived not from a treaty based obligation but from the duty of UN member states to implement the decisions of the Security so Council. In addition, persons would be surrendered to an international body rather than to another country. In any event, persons surrendered to the tribunal will have the benefit of internationally recognised procedural and legal safeguards. Furthermore, the bill provides for the Attorney-General to have a residual discretion to refuse the surrender of a person in exceptional circumstances. I note that a government amendment to be moved later proposes that the word 'exceptional' be replaced with 'special'. Although exercise of this discretion may cause some embarrassment internationally, it does provide discretionary protection for Australian residents that may not be available under the tribunal's safeguards. Parts 4 and 6 of the bill provide for other types of assistance to enable Australia to cooperate with the tribunal in the investigation and prosecution of alleged offenders, as required by the statute. Part 4 covers the taking of testimony and the production of evidence, the service of documents, search and seizure assistance, and assistance in relation to the giving of evidence at hearings, and assisting in investigations in foreign countries. It also appears that the tribunal may make forfeiture or confiscation orders under the statute and then seek to have those orders enforced in Australia. It is not totally clear exactly what kinds of orders, if any, the tribunal may make in relation to the proceeds of crime. It is envisaged at this stage that the tribunal is only likely to make forfeiture orders and therefore the bill in part 6 includes provisions whereby forfeiture orders may be enforced in Australia. If the tribunal determines at a later date that it will make restraintribunal's ing orders or pecuniary penalty orders, which it might seek to have enforced in a particular country, or that it will issue information gathering orders, then it will be necessary at that time to amend the legislation. Parts 4 and 6 are based upon corresponding provisions in the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. However, one major difference is the grounds on which a request may be refused. While the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act contains a number of such grounds, the bill has only very limited grounds, namely, that complying with the request would prejudice Australia's sovereignty, security or national interest or that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the non-compliance. This is a direct result of the binding international obligations in this situation. Apart from this matter, the procedures in parts 4 and 6 of the bill are almost identical to those employed in similar situations under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. Part 5 of the bill covers the possibility of the tribunal sitting in Australia. Although this is considered to be a remote possibility, the provisions are necessary because the Security Council resolution provides that, while the tribunal is to have its seat at The Hague, it may sit elsewhere when it considers it necessary for the efficient exercise of its functions. While sitting in Australia, the tribunal would be exercising the judicial power of the international community, not the judicial power of the Commonwealth. However, Commonwealth legislation is required to authorise the tribunal to exercise coercive powers within Australia, such as to compel attendance, and to require production of evidence. The Security Council resolution does not compel Australia to automatically authorise the exercise of such powers. As matters of comity, countries would expect agreements to be reached about the exercise of power in their territory by a foreign tribunal. Part 5 of the bill therefore enables the tribunal to sit in Australia for the purpose of performing its functions, and provides that the powers while sitting in Australia will be such powers as are prescribed by regulations. Those regulations will implement agreements between the Commonwealth and the tribunal about the powers that the tribunal may exercise while sitting in Australia. The bill is expected to have little impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue in the short term. However, there are possible implications for Commonwealth agencies which may be affected by the legislation. For example, there may be resource implications for the Australian Federal Police, and cost and resource implications might arise if the tribunal decides to sit in Australia. These costs cannot be quantified at all at this stage as they will depend upon the extent to which the legislation is used in Australia. However, the legislation will be reviewed after it has been in place for a period of 12 months to determine the extent to which it has been utilised and to assess the resource implications. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. NA TRIBUNAL (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994 The International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) Bill is consequential upon the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill 1994. It was introduced on 30 May 1994 and has been considered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. An amendment the bill arising from the committee's mendations will be moved later today. The bill makes consequential amendments to certain Commonwealth acts. The amendInternational ment of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act is to the effect that decisions under the International War Crimes Tribunal Act 1994 will not be subject to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial view) Act. A government amendment will from shortly be moved to delete this amendment. remarks. This will give effect to the committee's recommendation that decisions under the proposed act be subject to review under Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. The purpose of the amendments to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act is to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to appear in proceedings, and to grant indemnimy ties to persons who are to give evidence the purpose of proceedings, under the Internathat, tional War Crimes Tribunal Act. The amendments to the Migration Act the simply facilitate the entry into Australia subsequent departure of persons who are required in Australia for purposes connected with the International War Crimes Tribunal Act. The amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act enable forfeiture orders made by the for a long time. international tribunal and registered under the International War Crimes Tribunal Act to be enforced as if they were forfeiture orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Act at the time of registration. This is consistent with the approach by which foreign forfeiture orders registered in a court in Australia under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act are dealt with. The effect of the amendment to the Telethe communications (Interception) Act is to very ensure that lawfully intercepted information can be used in proceedings under division of part 4 of the International War Crimes Tribunal Act. Those proceedings cover taking of evidence, or production of docuforeign ments or other articles in Australia for purposes of, and at the request of, the tribuforeign nal. The bill is expected to have little impact to on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. I recomcommend the bill to the House.",67
37,Mr REITH,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"The coalition supports the principal bi\1, the War Crimes Tribunal Bill, and the consequential bill, the International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) BiIl, and I will address my remarks to various aspects of the bills before the House. I am Repleased to say that a number of colleagues the coalition parties will also make some I do so today in the permanent absence of the the former member for Kooyong, and I might just very briefly, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, add my comments to those already expressed on the recent resignation of  a member and part of my political understanding and circles for a very long time. In fact, late mother was a great admirer of Andfor rew Peacock, and I can remember how it was when the Sandringham branch of the Liberal Party was reformed in the late 1950s, rising star of the Liberal Party, then Mr and Andrew Peacock, was invited to chair the reformation meeting. My mother was a person of some political acumen, and when my mother said that Andrew Peacock was a person of stature and ability it was an impression and a remark that has remained with me Over the years, I suppose your appreciation of a person's quality varies a bit with your experience, but my experience with Andrew, and it has been solidified over time, is that Andrew is a person of very great character, and I know his departure from the House will be greatly missed. One of my colleagues in the media was remarking on his superlative performances in the last week in dealing with media. It shows you that experience is a valuable thing in politics. Of course, in the foreign affairs area he brought tremendous 1 experience and great credit to his country in the way in which he acted, not just as the the minister but as the shadow minister for affairs. So it is that I find myself the today warehousing the shadow ministry for affairs and speaking on this bill. The bills before the House will establish a legislative framework enabling Australia to comply with a resolution of the United Nations Security Council establishing an International War Crimes Tribunal. This tribunal will prosecute crime arising from the ongoing conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. In May 1993, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution establishing an international tribunal for the sole purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. This resolution adopted the statute of the international tribunal which details the competence, jurisdiction, powers, composition and procedure of the tribunal. The resolution was taken under chapter VII of the charter of the UN, which concerns actions with respect to threats to peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression. Resolutions taken by the Security Council pursuant to this chapter are mandatory and binding on members of the United Nations. In particular, article 29 of the statute provides: 1. States shall cooperate with the International Tribunal in the investigation and prosecution of persons accused of committing serious violations of international humanitarian law. 2. States shall comply without undue delay with any request for assistance or an order issued by a Trial Chamber, including, but not limited to: (a) the identification and location of persons; (b) the taking of testimony and the production of evidence; (c) the service of documents; (d) the arrest or detention of persons; (e) the surrender or the transfer of the to the International Tribunal. Pursuant to the terms of the resolution, Australia, along with other member countries, has an obligation, as is clear from the words I have just read, at international law to cooperate with the tribunal and to take measures under domestic law to implement the provisions of the resolution and the statute. This bill seeks to fulfil these international obligations by making provision for these matters in Australia's domestic law. Australia has made a significant contribution to the international tribunal. Sir Ninian Stephen, a former Governor General and High Court judge, has been appointed as one of the 11 judges of the tribunal by the General Assembly of the UN. The previous director of the Australian War Crimes Special Investigations Unit and the War Crimes Prosecutions Support Unit has been appointed a deputy prosecutor to the tribunal. The provisions of the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill have been outlined today by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan). Therefore, it is unnecessary for me to go to the provisions in any detail. But I will just say that part 1 of the bill is preliminary. Part 2 allows the tribunal to make a request for assistance to the Attorney-General. Part 3 establishes a mechanism that allows for the surrender of persons to the tribunal. There is a discretion in the executive, or government, to refuse a request by the tribunal. However, this discretion is much tighter than the Extradition Act 1988 on which the bill is modelled. Part 4 deals with other forms of assistance to the tribunal, including the taking of evidence and production of documents in Australia, search and seizure in Australia of evidentiary material, giving evidence at hearings or assisting in investigations in foreign countries. Part 5 covers the possibility, which is acknowledged by the government to be remote, of the tribunal sitting in Australia. Part 6 deals with the possibility of the tribunal making forfeiture orders and allows for their enforcement in Australia. Again, this part is modelled on provisions in other legisaccused lation; namely, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. Part 7 elaborates the powers of search, seizure and arrest. A brief history of the bill is that it was passed by the Senate with amendments, and there was a lot of debate in the Senate about aspects of the bill. The Australian Democrats introduced amendments which were not agreed to by the coalition. The shadow minister for justice, Senator Vanstone, who has had carriage of the bill in the Senate, believed that the amendments moved by the government and the Democrats required further examination and should be examined by a legal and constitutional affairs committee. After the first reading of the biII in the House of Representatives, the biII was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. From my reading of the Hansard, there was a discussion in parliament when the committee handed down its recommendations. There are a number of members on the committee from the coalition side: the honourable member for Tangney (Mr WiIIiams), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), the honourable mem member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). It is generally recognised that the committee has done a very thorough job. This confirms once again the usefulness to the parliament of a committee structure that can examine legislation of this sort in greater detail. The coalition had a number of concerns with the legislation. We were keen for the bill to be referred to a committee. Our concerns covered such matters as the potential embarrassment that could be caused by there being an opportunity for the Attorney-General to not pass over the subject of a warrant to the International War Crimes Tribunal. In other words, there was some discretion in the hands of the Attorney-General which may have created difficulties given the fact that Australia's participation in the UN places upon us a mandatory requirement to comply with such a request. We were also concerned that complications could arise in an emergency situation under the proposed legislation. There was also concern about the seriousness of agreeing to hand over citizens into someone else's jurisdiction especially when we could not rule out the prospect that it may be our citizens that could come within the jurisdiction of the tribunal. Those matters were referred to the committee and the committee did a very thorough job investigating them. The committee has basically answered the concerns that we had. I was very pleased to see in the committee report dated 30 June 1994 that the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), stated: . . . before surrendering an accused person the Australian legal system should ensure that surrender does not result in injustice, either in the manner in which the person is treated before surrender or in the fact of surrender. That is a most important point that the chairman made. I am pleased to see him in the chamber today presumably to speak on the bill. The government has now responded to the very extensive report of the parliamentary committee and the bulk of the recommendations have been picked up. The member for Tangney will speak on some of the recommendations contained in the report and the response from the government. He is one of the best qualified lawyers in the parliament. He is a Queen's Counsel. We are very pleased to have the benefit of his advice on this and many other matters. He has been concerned to encourage the government to take up a recommendation for the introduction of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) procedures into this legislative framework. This was a matter requiring a delicate balancing of factors by the government. After its reconsideration of the issue, it took up the recommendations of the committee. Having previously considered the matter and taken the decision the other way, this was quite a good win for the committee, and it reflects well on all concerned that the government has now erred on the side of providing an additional avenue of appeal for Australian citizens. There were two recommendations which the government did not entirely adopt in its otherwise supportive response to the committee's recommendations. The government did not accept recommendation No. 12 which was aimed at ensuring the right of Australians to return to Australia without falling foul of the current migration law. The government's response basically is that people have this right of return and it would not in any way be affected or reduced by the operations of our international obligations pursuant to this legislation. The second recommendation that the government did not adopt was recommendation No. 20, in relation to a sunset clause. The committee recommended that the idea of a sunset clause be further considered. After further consideration, the government rejected the idea of a sunset clause but came back with a commitment to review the operation of this legislation. I think the minister said it would be reviewed after 12 months, whereas the government's response mentioned a longer period. Be that as it may, it is importians ant that this new procedure be the subject of close monitoring to ensure that it operates in the way intended by the parliament. That is all I wish to contribute on behalf of the coalition parties in respect of the legislation. I want to make a general comment on Australia's action in complying with the obligations we have as a participant in the United Nations. From these bills, our message should be very clear-and I believe it is very clear: war crimes will not be tolerated. We stand ready with other participants in the United Nations, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden and Italy, to act against war criminals. The message to those responsible for heinous crimes against humanity is that the civilised world will give them no safe haven. Their conduct cannot be allowed to go unpunished. As a responsible member of the world community, we will undertake our obligations in concert with others to ensure that we do all we can to bring to justice those who commit heinous criminal offences. This is an important principle for all Australians per se, not just for way in which we stand as a member of the international community. If we are not prepared to stand against injustice elsewhere, we taint our own notions and standards of justice. Much has been said about international obligations, and there will be a lot more debate about them in this parliament. In this matter, we voluntarily enter into the United Nations and thereby voluntarily accept our obligations to the world community to participate in actions such as this. It may be mandatory for Australia to introduce, at domestic law, a legal framework so that we can meet our obligations at the UN, but we meet those obligations willingly because that is part and parcel of our participation in the work of the United Nations. It must always be the case for a country such as Australia to give very high priority to bringing to justice those who commit serious war crimes. There is evidence which may provide the basis for some prosecutions. For example, one that suspect is apparently in custody in Germany, and I understand that others may fall within the jurisdiction of this tribunal. Many Australwould feel that this is not a matter with which they are directly associated, and that may well be true, but I conclude by saying that we have obligations as a member of the international community and this legislation ensures that we meet those obligations. It thereby has the support of the coalition parties.",70
38,Mr MELHAM,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"I am pleased to rise in support of the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill and the International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) Bill which are before the House today. I understand that a number of amendments will be moved by the government later arising out of an advisory report that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs placed before the parliament on 30 June 1994. I have had the benefit of being provided with the government's response to that advisory report. Basically the advisory report by the committee made 21 recommendations that the committee thought would, in effect, be constructive suggestions that would strengthen the the legislation and would not detract from our international obligations. It is pleasing to note that the government has accepted, in effect, 18 of the 21 amendments and has partially accepted a 19th amendment, which is not a bad strike rate-18 1f2 out of 21 will do me any day of the week. That strike rate is indicative, frankly, of a number of things. We are fortunate on that committee to have a number of committed members from both sides of the parliament with a level of expertise that shows that exercises like these can be beneficial. We are also fortunate, in my opinion, to have a very professional secretariat, a secretariat that this parliament can be proud of. Too often we as members of parliament do not acknowledge enough the professional support structure we receive in this place. I would also like to commend the secondee from the Attorney General's Department, Ms Annette Willing, who was seconded to assist the committee in the preparation of the advisory report. This is only the second advisory report that has been placed before the parliament, but it is the second one where substantially the recommendations of the committee have been taken up by the government. That is no mean feat and stands testament to the professionalism, as I say, of the support structure that we have on the committee. The point needs to be made and reiterated that it is a partnership. In this report, and the previous one also, we were about making constructive suggestions. We had bipartisan support basically for the purposes of the legislation and for the principles behind the legislation. Frankly, I am a great believer that we are not here just as rubber stamps and that the repository of wisdom does not just lie in the executive or the bureaucracy. We are here as representatives of the people and we should be prepared through procedures like this, in terms of advisory reports or public hearings, to subject our legislation to scrutiny because I believe it can be enhanced and enriched. That is what has happened here. There is no doubt that, when the legislation was placed before the Senate, the government formed a particular view. I think the reason it formed a particular view was-and this should be noted-that we were one of the first countries to respond to United Nations resolution 827 that was passed on 25 May 1993 by the Security Council. As a committee, we had the benefit of looking at some draft legislation from other countries. As I said in my foreword to the committee report of 30 June, in making recommendations to the parliament it became important for us to ensure that: However, before surrendering an accused person the Australian legal system should ensure that surrender does not result in injustice, either manner in which the person is treated before surrender or in the fact of surrender. Basically, a lot of our recommendations were finetuning. The government did change its original approach to a couple of the substantial ones, which I will come to. Initially, it was a situation where the Australian Democrats had moved amendments in the Senate because the government's position was that it was not going to allow some judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 because it felt that that might constitute undue delay. It became obvious during the hearings, and indeed from what had happened in other countries overseas, that it was too strict a definition to say that the fact you were allowing people to exercise their legal obligations within your jurisdiction could itself constitute undue delay. It is good that the government has accepted the committee's recommendation in relation to that. Another recommendation the committee made that the government has accepted, and which I think will assist, is that 'exceptional circumstances' be replaced by 'special circumstances' in subclause 12(3) of the legislation. It is pleasing that the government has accepted that. Whilst we as a committee understand the use of the words 'exceptional' and 'special', we were attempting to ensure that there was some consistency in the terminology. It is worth reading the government's response, which states why it accepted this recommendation, because it summarises basically what the committee's concerns were. It states: The Government accepts this recommendationnamely, that 'exceptional' be replaced by 'special' in subclause 12(3). It continues: The Government considers that, in light of the objectives of the Bill, the seriousness of the alleged crimes and the mandatory nature of Australia's international obligations, the circumstances should be exceptional for bail to be granted to a person arrested pursuant to the Bill. The Committee appears to have accepted this concept. Indeed we did. The committee considered that the advantage of using 'special' instead of in the 'exceptional' would be that 'special circumstances' is a recognised term in the extradition field and there is a body of case law on its meaning. I think basically the government accepted that, which is pleasing. In my foreword to the advisory report I did give a narrative on these bills. I think it is worth restating. The purpose of the bills is to allow Australia to fulfil its obligations to the United Nations, to support the tribunal now being established in The Hague. The tribunal will try war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia since 1991. The tribunal was established by resolution 827 of 25 May 1993 of the Security Council. This resolution expressed: ... grave alann at continuing reports of widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law occurring within the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and especial\y in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including reports of mass killings, massive, organised and systematic detention and rape of women, and the continuance of the practice of ""ethnic cleansing"", including for the acquisition and the holding of territory. As a member of the United Nations, Australia is bound to give effect to resolution 827 and to its annexure, the Statute of the International Tribunal. The resolution urges all states to take any measures necessary under their domestic law to implement the provisions of the present resolution and the statute. The resolution, the Statute of the International Tribunal and comments by the president of the tribunal, Mr Antonio Cassese, combine to urge member states to surrender persons who are named in warrants issued by the tribunal without undue delay and to adopt a strict interpretation of this requirement. The tribunal has been established as the court with the responsibility to ensure internationally acceptable standards of justice are upheld. The committee has studied the comparable legislation of other countries and finds that in most cases wider safeguards than those encompassed by the Australian legislation are available before citizens are surrendered to the tribunal. Recognising the binding obligation to support the tribunal need not be interpreted as agreeing to the automatic surrender of accused persons to an international tribunal. It appears not to have been so interpreted by Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands, Canada or the UK. The upholding of legal rights should not be construed as undue delay in complying with resolution 827. Matters substantive to the charges laid against an accused person are the proper subject of trial before a trial chamber of the tribunal and should not be addressed before surrender. However, before surrendering the accused person, the Australian legal system should ensure that surrender does not result in injustice, either in the manner in which the person is treated before surrender or in the fact of surrender. Upon releasing the report the committee urged the parliament to pass both bills as soon as possible, allowing sufficient time to consider the amendments contained in the advisory report. Bringing war criminals to account, albeit in only one theatre of war, will act as a deterrent to the commission of further outrages, which is one of the main objectives of the tribunal. Enacting the legislation as soon as possible will allow Australia to comply with requests for assistance from the tribunal as soon as they are received. The incorporation of the amendments that have been accepted by the government as a result of our advisory report will produce legislation that Australia can be proud of in terms of complying with our international obligations. It will also mean-I reiterate this-that Australian citizens will still be able to exercise their rights under Australian law. They will not be able to go into a delaying process. All round, what we have managed to achieve is something substantial. I see I am getting the wind-up.",73
39,Mr TUCKEY,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"No, no; keep going.",75
40,Mr MELHAM,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"Does the honourable member for O'Connor want me to go to question time? It is worthwhile referring to a few of the committee's other recommendations which the government has accepted. The committee looked at the concept of the definition of federal and state prisoner. These are technical definitions. Indeed, we were grateful to Mr Sides QC and Mr James QC who came before the committee and volunteered their expertise without fee. The benefit of having those people come before the committee is that they are practitioners. They were able to point out to us some technical defects in the definitions that were in the legislation as it then stood. It is pleasing to see that the government has accepted the opinions of those eminent people. I believe that the repository of all wisdom does not reside in the Lodge, it does not reside in any particular ministerial office, it does not reside in any part of the bureaucracy. In my opinion, we have one of the best democracies in the world. We have a participatory democracy. Sometimes we tend to ignore those people out in the community who can contribute, those practitioners who want to contribute to ensuring that good legislation goes through this place. Advisory reports to this House are new. They have arisen out of the recent amendments to the procedures of this House. They are one of the more pleasing aspects of the reforms that we have undergone in recent times. The advisory reports that the legal and constitutional affairs committee has produced to the parliament have been reports of quality. They have been able to withstand scrutiny and they have resulted in better legislation. I would urge the government and, indeed, the opposition to continue to use this practice, necessarily just in the case of the legal committee but also in the case of other committees of the House. We are not here just as rubber stamps for the executive. In a lot of these instances-this is a perfect example of it-we can make a contribution by bringing in people from the community to advise the parliament on how to get it right, how to do it better. I commend the bills before the House. There is no doubt that they will have the unanimous support of all members of the House, as they should. This is one of those pleasing matters that is not a party political thing; it has bipartisan support. We can stand tall in the community of nations knowing that Australia has responded appropriately by this legislation to the call from the UN Security Council resolution.",75
41,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"Order! It being approximately 3 p.m., the debate is interrupted. In accordance with standing order lOlA, the debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Drought: Interest Rates",76
42,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Finance aware that a farmer in drought affectand ed Queensland has recently had his loan interest rates increased by 2.38 per cent? This rate increase means a massive jump in his costs of $6,000 per annum, or $115 per week, during this appalling drought. This farmer cannot currently afford to continue to pay for feeding stock and, according to the Treasurer, further interest rate increases are on the cards. Does the minister agree that interest rate policy has more impact than the government's drought package at this critical time for the farm sector and so many farmers? Why has the Prime Minister chosen to announce the drought package at 3.30 p.m., which is an insult to this House?",76
43,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure that the drought package that will be announced later today will please the honourable gentleman a great deal. It is a generous package which will offer relief to a very large number of our fellow citizens who are in a great deal of trouble. All not honourable members will be aware, when they see it, of how well targeted it is. This is going to be a drought package that will get assistance into the hands of the people who actually need it. There has been some considerable doubt as to whether that has been the case with previous drought packages. On the matter that the honourable member raised in relation to interest rates, the Treasurer had a great deal to say about that yesterday and I do not want to add a great deal more to what he had to say about it. However, I point out that this is still a very low interest rate regime in Australian historical standards. It is a regime that is capable of being held at that level largely because the fundamentals of the economy in this country are very good indeed. We cannot completely evade the consequences of what happens elsewhere when it comes to a determination of interest rate policy as we are not an isolated economy. In so far as the fundamentals of the management of the economy in this country are concerned, we have a government operating on the basis that it has the lowest possible impact upon any particular level of interest rates at any particular time of just about any other nation in the OECD. Industrial Relations: Wage Rises",76
44,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Minister for Industrial Relations aware of the decision handed down by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission earlier today? Is the minister aware that the decision has been welcomed by unions but criticised by employer groups such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry? Can the minister inform the House of the government's response to this decision?,77
45,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The federal government warmly welcomes today's decision by the Industrial Relations Commission which provides for three $8 safety net adjustments to workers unable to gain pay rises through enterprise bargaining. We also welcome the commission's decision to conduct a series of pilot reviews in the lead-up to the overall review of awards which is required in accordance with the government's Industrial Relations Reform Act. We fully support the commission's stated intention to make awards easier to understand, more adaptable to the needs of the enterprise, non-discriminatory and consistent. Today's decision represents a further step in the important transition from a centralised wages system to one of enterprise bargaining which is underpinned by a strong and relevant award safety net of wages and entitlements. Whilst the accord partners have welcomed it, I note that today the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has branded this decision as the worse for years. Its response would do Scrooge proud. Australia currently has strong economic growth. We have company profits at record levels and the salaries of senior managers are on the way up. Yet the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry would seek to deny workers increases of $8 per week-hardly what any fair-minded Australian would call excessive. ACCI and those who hold its view should realise that, as a result of this decision, are going to have to work cooperatively with the union movement, other employers, the government and the commission to ensure the success of the award review process that lies ahead. Today's decision completes the changes introduced by the government with our new industrial relations laws in March this year. It strengthens the award safety net and provides incentives for enterprise bargaining. Many workers will gain access to an immediate safety net adjustment. I conclude by saying that this is a decision of which we should all be proud. It reinforces confidence in the commission and in Australia's industrial relations system-a system which provides essential protection to workers and alI the incentives for enterprise bargaining. NA",77
46,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before I calI the honourable member for Parkes, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from Norway led by Madam President Grondahl. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Drought: Interest Rates",77
47,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Finance, follows on from yesterday. Like the question by the Leader of the National Party, which received an unsatisfactory answer, it concerns the effect of interest rate rises on farming families. Martyn and Penny Buckland are a typical couple who live in the western division of my electorate. Government members-Oh!",77
48,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You people might laugh, but it is a very serious matter affecting farming people.",77
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. Mr Bruce Scott interjecting,77
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Maranoa! Those on my right! I remind members on they both sides asking questions to keep their preambles short.,77
51,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For this young and struggling couple, on what is a fairly average farm debt of $450,000, they were paying 11 per cent, or $49,500 per year, interest.",78
52,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,78
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You wouldn't know!,78
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Benne]ong is not helping his co))eague.,78
55,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sorry to see you people laughing at this. Does the minister realise that the recent government induced rise of 0.75 per cent is lifting their interest repayments by $3,375 per year to $52,875? Does the minister also realise that if another one per cent rise flows through, as is likely in the next few months, their interest commitments wiJ) rise a further $4,500 per year to $57,375? WiIJ these interest rate increases far outweigh any possible assistance to Martyn and Penny Buckland from the government's announced drought package?",78
56,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not in a position to know the individual financial arrangements of any particular farmer. To assume that I do in the answer to a question is very siJ)y. The position that people find themselves in in relation to interest rates is determined by the nature of the Joan that they took out with their particular bank and whether the bank has chosen to pass on, in business rates or in rates to farmers, the fu)) extent of the increase. There wiJ) be a variety of experiences in the rural community as there wiIJ be elsewhere in the country. I can only add to and re-emphasise what was said by the Treasurer when he answered these questions yesterday. Interest rate policy is fundamenta))y directed towards keeping in place our very favourable inflation record. Interest rates supporting that are at historica))y low levels in this country. The fact of the matter is that the interests of your friends on the farm very much lie in sustaining that low inflation rate regime. As monetary policy enhances that, they ought to be pleased with it. Economy",78
57,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware of a document which claims, among other things, that Australia has experienced declining international competitiveness and that Australia has one of the highest persona] tax burdens in the OECD, we)) above the average of seven major industrial countries? Can the minister inform the House what the official figures are? Is it the intention of the government to review its budget figures in light of the data?",78
58,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I do recognise the particular document that the honourable gentleman refers to. It is among that farrago of nonsense which appeared in The Things That Matter. One of the claims in The Things That Matter is that we have declining international competitiveness. The Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes data on our international competitiveness each month in its publication Australian economic indicators. What that data gathered by the ABS shows is that between 1982-83 and 1992-93, a)) three indexes by which competitiveness is measured showed improvements to the tune of 27.3 per cent, 29.6 per cent and 31.5 per cent respectively. We do not have fu)) year figures for this year but the indication from the first three quarters is that, again, on a)) three versions, this year we will improve our competitiveness over last year. So, far from a decline in our international competitiveness, as claimed by that extraordinarily inaccurate document, there has been an absolutely massive improvement in Australia's international competitiveness. The Things That Matter then goes on to say that Australia has: ... one of the highest personal tax burdens in the DECO well above the average of the seven major industrial countries ... The statistics that the secretariat of the OECD compiled present a tota))y different picture. Each year, the OECD publishes a volume titled Revenue statistics of OECD member countries. The latest complete set of figures is for 1992, and it measures the personal income tax to GDP ratio. For Australia, total income tax co))ected-and that includes the Medicare levy, as these figures are taken out on equivalents so where there is an equivalent sort of charge to a levy associated with income in any of the countries measured it is incorporated within the statistics-was 11.7 per cent. The average rate of personal taxation for OECD countries was 15.7 per cent. Out of the 24 OECD countries covered, Australia had the fifth lowest personal tax to GOP ratio. The document leaves all that aside and talks about the big seven. That is what the document refers to, not necessarily the OECD average. Of the so-called big seven, not one of the seven countries mentioned in the document presented a better picture than did Australia. The nearest to us was Japan, at 12.1 per cent compared with our 11.7 per cent. There was then the United Kingdom, 12.6 per cent; the United States, 14 per cent; France, l3.5 per cent; Italy, 15.6 per cent; Canada, 16.5 per cent; and Germany, 18.6 per cent. In most of those countries, the indirect tax that people are obliged to ante up is also in excess of Australia's. So it is not as though there is somehow or other a weighting inside Australia, perhaps in the indirect taxation area, because many of them have the sort of value added tax that the opposition wanted to put in place. If that is the level of statistical comprehension that underpins The Things That Matter, it is small wonder that opposition members do not wish to reveal the rest of the statistics associated with the costing of their program. Budget Deficit: Interest Rates",78
59,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Does he agree with the recent study by the National Farmers Federation that reducing the budget deficit this year by $2 billion could reduce long-term interest rates by one full percentage point? Has Treasury done any modelling on this proposal and is there a connection between lower budget deficits and lower interest rates, which would mean lower mortgage payments for Australian home owners?",79
60,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again, that particular proposition was answered by the Treasurer yesterday in a different form. As far as that estimate is concerned, no, I have not seen the study along those lines, but I say this: if they do think that the $2 billion ought to have been put in place, we could have got $600 million closer to that target if you had let us. Mr Costello-Ha, ha.",79
61,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say to the opposition spokesman on Treasury matters that it has occasionally been my misfortune, but a requirement, to walk through an asylum. Every now and then you notice as you walk through one that people walking along the sides of the halls occasionally back themselves against a wall and let out a loud barking laugh, as you and the assistants go past. That is somewhat reminiscent of the way the opposition spokesman carries on on the front bench.",79
62,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. I find that remark objectionable and I do not think it should be used about any member of the House. I would like him to withdraw, Mr Speaker.",79
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What remark?,79
64,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The remark that linked a member of this,79
65,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the sake of peace at this point, I do not know what he finds objectionable but I withdraw everything he finds objectionable. As far as the Opposition Leader's answer is concerned, it was pointed out to you very effectively by the Treasurer yesterday that there is not necessarily at any point of time a direct connection between the level of deficit and the level of interest rates. A multiplicity of factors impact upon interest rates. So you can have the situation in New Zealand, which has a budget actually moving into surplus but at the same time its official interest rates are above ours. How, on your criteria, would you explain that set of circumstances? While you may well like your economics simple, they are not and there is not necessarily a direct connection between any particular level of deficit at any point of time and short-term interest rates. Corporations Law",79
66,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I refer the Attorney-General to recent suggestions that section l316 of the Corporations Law may impede the proper pursuit of corporate crime. The Attorney would of course be aware that section 1316 imposes a five-year limitation period on the commencement of prosecutions for offences under the Corporations Law unless the Attorney consents to an extension of that period of time. Can the Attorney General advise the House what action he intends to take in respect of that section?,79
67,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly am aware of criticisms of that provision in the Corporations Law. Indeed, the honourable member in his capacity as chair of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities in its report a bit earlier this year also referred to this section and to views expressed by the head of the Australian Securities Commission, Mr Allan Cameron, that that provision is an impediment to the proper pursuit of wrongdoing under the Corporations Law. The particular provision has its genesis in similar provisions in the old companies code and was incorporated into the new Corporations Law during that process of effectively adopting the status quo of the law. The provision is, in my view, odd inasmuch as it remains the only provision which requires the consent of the Attorney-General in terms of whether a prosecution should proceed. With the establishment of the Director of Public Prosecutions there has been a clear division of responsibility in terms of whether prosecutions should proceed or not, that being vested in independent bodies clearly away from the political process. As a general rule I obviously concur that that is a sound practice. In light of how we should then deal with section 1316, I know that the honourable member would like his committee to examine this provision to see whether it maintains some relevance. I recall hearing the member for Banks when I was walking into the chamber telling the House of the excellent work which parliamentary committees do. In light of that advice and the honourable member's request, I inform the House that I will be referring this specific question to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities and asking it to investigate whether this provision in the law should be changed. Shipping: Australian National Line",80
68,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. In order for the minister to avoid the charge of engaging in a cover-up, will he release all correspondence between the old board of ANL and him since the government announced the sale of the company, as well as the Price WaterhouseSalomon Brothers report that caused the minister to claim 'you could not even give it away'? If the minister will not act in a clear and transparent manner when he is responsible for such large amounts of money, what does he have to hide?",80
69,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad the honourable member mentioned acting in a clear and transparent manner because he certainly was not yesterday in this chamber when he directed a question to my colleague the Minister for Finance in which he said, 'Will the Minister for Finance confirm the comments made by the Minister for Transport'-that is me-'that the government is considering removing fuel excise from the shipping industry, costing $26 million per year?' I said no such thing and well he knows it. I just wanted to get that in in the interests of transparency. The member asks me a question that has been on the agenda in the Senate these last few days. I repeat the advice that my colleague Senator Collins has given today in respect of that. He stated that the task of compiling documents on request from the Senate-we tabled the first list on 19 September in accordance with a notice of motionwas a truly enormous one. In particular, the exercise to locate and identify all of the documents requested was considerable. It involved searching some 600 files and thus far some 270 documents have been listed for the information of the Senate. Five officers have been involved full time, as have a number on a less than full-time basis, to identify relevant documents. The government has in good faith made the results of that search available to the Senate as soon as possible in accordance with the Senate's wishes. Having said that, each of these documents in terms of their content will need to be carefully considered in respect of issues of commercial confidentiality or cabinet confidentiality. To the extent that it is possible to release them. I most certainly will release them. The member asked also about the Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers report. I have already released a suitablyMr Costello-Doctored!",80
70,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is interesting that you say 'doctored'. The fact is that I asked for that document to be made available subject to the commercial-in-confidence requirements that are upon us as a result of the agreements between ANL and its partners. It was made available and I have been very open about the process. If opposition members want to have access to commercial-in-confidence information, one would need to have a lot more confidence in how they would use that information than one could have on the basis of their record so far. On that basis, it is not intention to make the rest of the report available to them. Australia Remembers Program",81
71,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Following the successful national and state launches the Australia Remembers program, can the minister inform the House how the governparliamentary ment intends to involve regional and country Australia in this program and what funding arrangements have been set in place to acbers commodate community based schemes to thought guarantee that ordinary Australians, particuthan larly those in country areas and city will have the opportunity to participate?",81
72,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Lyons for his question. I am looking forward to being in his electorate Thursday. I will be in a lot of other electorpeople ates as well. In fact, I have already been to number of electorates belonging to opposition members and will continue so to do. I know that this is a program which is capturing the imagination of everybody in community. The 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in 1995 is a moment in history which cannot go unnoticed and which should be commemorated by the Australian people. As a result, I have arranged to set up throughout Australia a number of state based committees-I have given them some funding as well-to enable them to coordinate a series of commemorative activities throughout the whole period, particularly during January, and to commemorate the 50th anniversary of victory in the Pacific in August 1995. I have already been to all of these states and territories and have arranged to launch the committees. I have appointed chairpersons in each of the states and there is a great deal of enthusiasm everywhere. I was in Adelaide only the other day. In addition, what I would like to ensure is that the people of that era-those people who should be known as the heroic generation of the time, who went through a depression and later six years of world war-are adequately remembered by those who have been left the legacy of a free country and a good standard my of living. I think the best way to do that is to ensure that everybody in Australia-the whole 17 million-plus people in this country-has an opportunity to say 'thank you' and to remember them. We will ensure that everyonewhether they live in the city, in the country or in places such as Queenstown in northern of Tasmania-is given that opportunity. Accordingly, I have requested all my colleagues in the House of Representatives-the whole 147 of them-to set up and coordinate local Australia Rememcommittees in their federal divisions. I it would be better to do it that way to ask all the local authorities-almost suburbs, 1,000 of them-to do the same. I have written to all members of this House and I have asked them how they can best arrange their coordinating committees. I have next asked them to make sure that they invite from service clubs and schools, not a just people from RSLs. This is not necessarily something for just the ex-service community to be involved in: we should try to involve the whole community. I have made sure that the each committee will get some seeding funds. As a result, each local Australia Remembers committee can apply through its local member, as the facilitator, for up to $20,000, and that is supposed to be only seeding funds. You will find that once the general media, which have been very supportive on this, and the Australian public get their minds around what this means, sponsors will be jumping out of trees in your local electorates. It is a double-edged sword. Your committee will be given $20,000. You will be given the responsibility of facilitating this and your local RSLs, shire councils and city councils will be on to you. It is a responsibility which every member of this House has. I would ask them to make sure that they do this properly and to make sure that they appropriately commemorateMr MCGauran-You had better watch the Western Australians.",81
73,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is a very serious thing. I know you will do it in your electorate. It has nothing to do with anything else. I conclude by saying that this is a great opportunity for all members of this House to do something worthwhile for their constituencies and for the many thousands of people who live in their electorates and are veterans. I look forward to giving them whatever assistance I can in achieving that aim. Vietnam Veterans,82
74,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, with your indulgence: I would like to add the support of the coalition to the remarks of the minister concerning the Australia Remembers celebration. I point out that the minister has circulatsumers ed significant amounts of information to all members of this House.",82
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We appreciate that.,82
76,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and it is about a matter which I thought he would have given priority in his dorothy dixers today. Is the minister aware of the front page story in the Gold Coast Bulletin of 19 September, which estimates that at least 30,000 Vietnam veterans who were engaged in active service are eligible for back pay for holiday leave loading that was not paid to them at the time? Mr Leo MCLeay-Who was in government then? Mr TUCKEy-It is amazing what you people see as funny.",82
77,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,82
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my right! The member for O'Connor will come to his question.,82
79,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the minister confirm that a Gold Coast veteran has already received $1,750 from the department after he pointed out the discrepancy? What steps will the minister's department take to ensure that other eligible veterans or their families finally receive this entitlement?",82
80,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Unfortunately, it is not a question that should be directed to me because it is a matter that is within the ambit of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. If it were under my control and I could answer it, I would certainly be very happy to. But might I thank the honourable member for O'Connor because I do know that he is very much behind the Australia Remembers activity and, to that extent, I know he will be working with us. I am sure that, in the week when we next meet, he can ask that question and an appropriate answer will be given to him from the appropriate minister. Home Building Industry",82
81,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. Has the government received complaints from conand community groups about the lack of fair dispute settling systems in the home building industry, does this lack cause great hardship among affected consumers, and can the minister advise honourable members what action the government has taken to resolve this problem?",82
82,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. Yes, this is an area which has caused enormous concern to consumers. Average Australian families probably never make a bigger investment than in the building of their own homes. There have been some terrible problems in the home building industry. Most builders are not unfair and unjust, but certainly the problems are caused by those builders who are. The effect on consumers is savage and can be ruinous for a family. The federal government has tried to take the lead in this area. The Trade Practices Commission instituted an inquiry last year resulting in a report entitled Home building: consumer problems and solutions. The TPC found a number of major problems in this industry, including contract conditions, lack of information, difficulties over insurance. But by far the biggest problem was the mandatory arbitration clause in contracts, which is inherently biased against consumers and favours builders. The difficulty here is that all these problems have to be addressed by state governments. I have consistently asked state governments to address this issue. The Queensland government, I am pleased to say, has a very progressive system in this area but other governments do not seem to have acted with the same sense of urgency, even though the problems are absolutely massive for consumers. At the ministerial council in 1993, I pointed out the work that had been done by the Trade Practices Commission and asked for action. At the ministerial council this year, there was no indication of progress. This is a matter of concern and anger to consumers. This year the state ministers did agree to report to the next meeting of the ministerial council on what developments had occurred, but that hardly gives an indication of the urgency of the problem being addressed. I have raised the matter with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing and Regional Development to see whether at a federal level we can investigate ways in which we can help. To sum up: home building is a terrible trap for unwary consumers; state governments have the responsibility in this area; the federal government has put proposals to every state government asking them to indicate how they can help in this way and it is very disappointed with the progress so far. But, of course, we will press on in the interest of consumers. Republic",82
83,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. I refer the Attorney General to a speech made last weekend by the pro-republican constitutional lawyer Professor George Winterton and, in particular, his concessions that, in order to achieve the Keating republic without the support of the states, there would be substantial 'constitutional uncertainty' and, furthermore, the prospect of an anomalous hybrid political system combining both republics and constitutional monarchies. I ask the Attorney-General: does he accept these learned conclusions from Professor Winterton?",83
84,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Clearly, an outcome which would see Australia as a nation move to a republican model with an Australian head of state as president and with the individual states still having as their notional head the Queen of Australia, as represented by state governors, is something which is, in my view, totally ridiculous and should be avoided. However, inasmuch as that difficulty is one which is clearly before the government, I think we do have advice-and I am now going from recolIection; I think it may have been advice which is also mentioned in the Turnbull report-that the referendum proposal, in order to enable Australia to become a republic, could in fact also cover the states at that same time. But this, along with other matters, is obviously something which the ministerial committee looking at these questions has before it. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. If that advice has not been made available to the Attorney-General, in the interests of informed debate, table it.",83
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! That is not a point of order; that is another question. Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital,83
86,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. In the wake of the sale of Repatriation General Hospital Greenslopes to the Ramsay Health Care Group, announced by the minister on Sunday 18 September, can he assure veterans in my electorate and throughout Queensland that the standard of health care to which they have become accustomed will not suffer as a result of the sale; and, secondly, that Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital will remain accessible to all veterans who have a special attachment to that hospital?",83
87,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I also thank him for being present last Sunday when I announced the successful tenderer for the sale of the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital. I know that this is an issue of great interest to Queensland members not only from my side of the House but also from the opposition side, particularly the member for MCPherson and the member for Maranoa, who, with respect to other repatriation hospitals, kept asking, 'What about Greenslopes?' The member for MCPherson is indicating that it was him. I will tell him about Greenslopes. The position is that we have a successful tenderer. There were three tenderers, two of whom were very close in terms of nonfinancial considerations: service to veterans and quality of care. The Ramsay Health Care Group was the best, marginally, in terms of financial and non-financial considerations. It has agreed that, as from 6 January next year, it will take the hospital over. I am very comfortable with that particular company. In February of this year, it took over the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital in Western Australia. During that time, not once have I received a ministerial or letter of complaint the standard of care at Hollywood Repatriation Hospital. I have been given personal assurances in writing. The owner of the Australian privately owned company, Paul Ramsay, who was also present at the announcement, has assured me of the guarantee asked for by the honourable membernamely, that health services to the veterans will still be as good. He has given me that assurance, and I accept it. I am told that they will probably be even better. The company is going to spend $8 miIIion in the next two to three years refurbishing the place, rebuilding the aged and extended care part of the hospital and the psychiatric unit, and providing car park spaces and that sort of thing. In terms of accessibility, I have been assured that the Queensland veteran community, consisting of 67,000 people, is entitled to receive priority of access to that hospital. I am very happy that that group is going to take the hospital over. I am sure that it will work. The Queensland treatment monitoring committee, which is made up of ex-service organisations, will oversee the transitional period, and I am sure it will let me know if anything goes wrong. I would be very happy for Queensland members in this House to let me know of any problems associated with the hospital, and I will certainly look at them. NRMA Share Float",83
88,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Should the NRMA share float be successful, will the government treat any NRMA share price rises as unrealised capital gains for the pension means test? Bearing in mind that shares obtained before August 1992 are exempt from the unrealised capital gains provisions and that NRMA shares would have previously been assets held in a mutual association, will NRMA shares be treated as being obtained at the date the member joined the NRMA or the date of the float? In other words, will pensioners who receive between $500 and $1,000 worth of shares as a result of the float have their pensions reduced possibly every time the price of these shares increases or at the date of the float at the listed value of those shares?",84
89,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I understand it, the on NRMA share float, to which the honourable member refers, is still subject to finalisation of the particulars of the way it will operate. As I also understand it, the beneficiaries from that will have the option of either accepting a share or accepting the $500 or whatever amount in cash. If that $500 is received, it is not brought to account for the purposes of the social security income test. But, to the extent that there is capital growth on that shareholding-and this needs to be finalised because, as I said, we need to see the final details of that-as a normal matter of course, any capital growth on that $500 as distinct from the $500 itself would be subject to the social security income test. Mr Ruddock-Is the share price grandfathered?",84
90,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not wish to add any more than that at this stage. Once we see the final shape of the proposal from the NRMA, we will be in a position to give a definitive response. Rabaul",84
91,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. All members of this House would be aware of the tragic situation in Rabaul in New Britain. Can the minister inform the House what assistance is being provided by Australia to assist in this tragic situation?,84
92,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just for the information of the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister announced that I would represent both the foreign minister and the defence minister in the course of question time this week as they are both ill. The latest information from our mission in Port Moresby is that the Vulcan and Tavurvur volcanoes are still erupting and that lava is flowing from both. Volcanic ash continues to fall on Rabaul and across the northern part of the Gazelle Peninsula. Lava flows have sealed off the Simpson Harbour, blocking it from the sea. Rabaul airport is closed and the harbour is unsafe to use. It is estimated that around 30,000 people have been evacuated from the area. We have been in close contact with the PNG government's national disaster and emergency service since the eruptions occurred. A very difficult operating environment exists in and around Rabaul. Communications with the region are problematic and it has been difficult to gain an accurate assessment of needs. The first priority is to assist the PNG government to transport essential emergency supplies to the affected area. Despite these difficulties, I am pleased to report that Australia has already responded to the emergency. Early this morning the first Hercules flight left Port Moresby for Tokua with urgently needed Red Cross supplies and aviation fuel. The plane is due back this afternoon and will immediately reload and transport another package of emergency supplies to the region. The plane has taken an AIDAB officer, who will undertake a preliminary assessment of the relief effort on the ground. A Foreign Affairs officer is also on board and will set up consular services in Kokopo. A second RAAF Hercules aircraft containing shelter materials, water containers and water filtration units is expected to leave Richmond air base tomorrow morning. The government's aid agency, AIDAB, is closely monitoring the situation and will make regular visits to Rabaul to assess relief needs. As the case with the tragedy in Rwanda, I am pleased to report that our assistance is timely and effective. Republic",85
93,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a further question to ask the Attorney-General following on from his answer to my last question on the options the government is considering for the Keating republic. I refer him, again, to the speech Professor Winterton made on the weekend. In picking up on the question of the introduction of a republic in a state, Professor Winterton said: A republican government could, therefore, be introduced into a state by a referendum under section 128, even against the wishes of the electors of that state. Given the Attorney-General's last answer, is the government seriously considering as an option acting against the wishes of electors in a particular state?",85
94,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the provisions of section 128 is that for a referendum to be carried it has to be passed by the majority of electors in a majority of states. As a consequence, it is quite possible-and it has occurred in a small number of referendums that have passed in Australia in the last 94 yearsfor some states to have measures imposed on them through referendum and constitutional change which a majority of electors in that state may not have supported. I note that the particular legal opinion referred to obviously was the one which was before the Turnbull committee. This issue and how it should be responded to is before ministers at the moment.",85

97,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, you are aware that last night a state dinner was held for the Taoiseach or Prime Minister of Ireland. This was held at an important moment in the history of Ireland. Whilst not wishing to elevate a particular incident, I ask whether you are aware of an interruption by a member of this House to the proceedings when the Prime Minister of Ireland was speaking? For the benefit of the House, would you clarify your jurisdiction, which is jointly held with the President of the Senate, over the Great Hall of the parliament and outline to what extent that applies to state dinners?",86
98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The President and I act as de facto ministers and are responsible parts of this building, including the Great Hall. With respect to public activities that are held here, our permission is sought and in most cases granted. On occasions when major public events take place, such as the dinner last night, obviously permission is always granted. If there was concern about the to behaviour of any individual in the course that dinner, then that is a matter for the individual to reflect on. Shipping: Australian National Line",86
99,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"During question time roster yesterday the member for Ryan asked the Minister for Finance whether it was a fact without union financial involvement no consortium which purchased ANL would benefit from announced government assistance measures. The minister answered as follows: Our position is available on all aspects of an tender process. Going down the particular roads that you suggest, when we arrive at conclusions those matters, after we have tested the economic viability, that position would apply to any particular set of arrangements that we would put in place. In light of the minister's frequent attacks on ensued. members of the opposition by way of rereading their comments with his emphasis, could you request that in future he at least intelligible in his answer on matters of such importance.",86
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I do not believe that is an issue that goes to my area of responsibility. Dinner Question Time Roster,86
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, you will recall that during question time the member for O'Connor directed a question to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs which prima facie, given that it did relate to the welfare of veterans, was within his area of public responsibility.",86

103,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Just wait. And it could not be said that it was self-evidently unrelated to his area of responsibility.

105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order!,86
106,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, you will be aware that when the new arrangement was introduced the Leader of the House undertook review the operation of the roster. In your of capacity as the Presiding Officer of the House, and given your general responsibility for the good functioning of the House, have you had any discussions with the Leader of the House regarding the operation of the system? In light of what happened today, which highlighted one of the great that weaknesses of the system, will you do so?",86
107,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The answer to the last part of the honourable member's question is no, I have not had any such discussions. The question of rostering and so on is a matter for the government. The honourable member will open know, of course, that this proposition came on forward as a result of consideration by the House of a report of the Procedure Committee. I understand there were reservations at the time, and I can recall the debate that The minister in whose portfolio responsibility this question might have rested would be not have been rostered on today in any case. I suspect that perhaps the question would not have been directed to that particular minister by members of this place knowing the roster is available to them. On the broader question about consideration, the Manager of Opposition Business may like to take up that matter with the Leader of the House at another time. NA",86

111,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,87
112,Mr SHARP,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Today in question time, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), in answering a question that I put to him, preceded his answer by saying that the day before I had put a question to the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) which included material that was wrong. Indeed, the material he claimed was wrong was the part of the question which asked the minister to respond to the claim made by the Minister for Transport that the government would consider removing fuel excise for the shipping industry and also increasing depreciation rates for shipowners. The Minister for Transport claimed that he had never said that and that I was quite wrong in claiming that in the question that I put to the Minister for Finance. I will prove my case by referring to three press articles that came out last week. The first article, written by Kate Lenthall in the Age, states: Mr Brereton said yesterday the tax breaks that the Government had committed itself to consider would return the operation to a positive net worth. They include international seafarers being exempted from PAYE income tax, as weIJ as a fuel excise rebate and faster depreciation of assets shipping companies. The second article, written by Malcolm Farr and Peter Lewis in the Telegraph Mirror, states: The government is also prepared to consider fuel excise relief, and an increased depreciation allowleague ance on modem, smaIJ-crew vessels, but has not costed these proposals. The third article, written by Mark Davis and Tim Dodd in the Financial Review, states: Exemptions for shipping from fuel excise are also being considered. In addition to that, yesterday my office rang the journalist who wrote one of those articles to confirm whether it was correct that the Minister for Transport had said in an interview that the government was considering removing or reducing fuel excise for shipping and increasing depreciation rates for shipowners. The journalist said that he had definitely done so. I rest my case by saying that the minister is obviously wrong and I am obviously right.",87
113,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The honourable member has already achieved his objective, because fuel excise for international shipping is not charged. Mr Downer-What is the basis of this intervention?",87

119,Mr CAMPBELL,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"After 15 years in this House, I find myself called upon to make a personal explanation. In today's West Australian in an article headed, 'MP attacks Jewish lobby', the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) is quoted as saying: Mr Campbell is the chief defender of the antiSemitic League of Rights in the Australian Parliament. for The member for Higgins knows that is not true. It is true that I spoke to the League of Rights. I made it clear when I did so that I was there to tell the league what I thought, not to listen to what it thought. A perusal of Hansard will show that I have described the as 'overrated, largely irrelevant, small and obscure' - hardly terms, I would have thought, of defence. What I have been doing is defending free speech. What the member for Higgins is doing is promoting MCCarthyism-all too rampant in this House, in the media and in academia. NA",87

Debate (on motion by Mr Howard) adjourned. NA Telecom Network and Customer Issues and Telephone AfTordability",88
121,Mr LEE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"DobeIl-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism)-by leave-Honourable members will recall that on 24 March this year I provided the House with details of the government's response at that time to aIlegations that Telecom had monitored and recorded telephone conversations of certain customers without their consent. I indicated at that time that I would report back to honourable members on all of these matters. On 29 August, Senator Bourne tabled a number of documents in the Senate concerning these and other issues related to Telecom's performance of service. The purpose of my statement today is to report progress on Telecom network and customer issues, including those raised by Senator Bourne. I also wish to inform the House of government initiatives to expedite the basic goals of ensuring that all Australians have access to a telephone service that is affordable and that works to world-class standards and that our telephone carriers conform to the highest standards of ethical behaviour and customer service. Police Investigations The criminal investigation into aIlegations that Telecom had recorded phone calls of certain customers without their consent, which I initiated in January, is still being finalised. I understand that the report of the Australian Federal Police investigating team is under examination by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The later allegations by Mr Robert Bray that his telephone conversations were monitored without his consent also remain under investigation. It is important that nothing is said or done which would in any way attempt to intervene or pre-empt the finding of these investigations. I can, however, assure honourable members that the government will take whatever action is necessary arising from the completion of these investigations. Network and Customer Issues Turning to the government's further initiatives, let me first deal with the performance of the telephone network. It is essential that the overall performance of each of Australia's carrier networks is of a high standard and meets consumer expectations. Carrier network performance should be measured independently against appropriate minimum standards that apply to residential and business customers and metropolitan and country residents. I will ask Austel to accelerate its current development of end-to-end network performance standards with a view to having these in place by early 1995. The Austel network performance standards will be mandatory, and failure to comply with these standards will be a breach of the carriers' licence conditions. Austel will monitor performance against these standards and will also review them to ensure that they reflect the changing telecommunications environment. There has been, and will continue to be, consumer input to this process through Austel's standards advisory committee. In addition, Austel will improve the information content of its quarterly report entitled Quality of service. This development will focus on switched telephone network performance for customers and will seek to provide information on a wider range of services and quality of service measures than presently reported. Austel intends to consult with consumers and major users in this development. Austel will develop a capability independent of the carriers to monitor compliance with these mandatory standards and it will be empowered to appoint independent consultants to carry out these tests. Another important issue is the ongoing modernisation of telecommunications networks in Australia, including that of Telecom. Telecom has previously developed a major upgrading of its telephone network. To ensure that upgrading proceeds on an equitable basis, the Commonwealth will enter into a formal network development deed with Telecom which is broadly comparable to existing network development deeds with Optus and Vodafone. Targets will be set in consultation with Telecom and Austel, with priority being given to digitisation of exchanges and improving services in rural areas. The starting point for negotiation of the deed will be threefold: firstly, Telecom's future mode of operation, the FMO plan, which provides for expenditure of $3.3 billion over the next five years; secondly, the recommendations of Austel's April 1994 COT report for network modernisation; and, thirdly, the existing commitments to roll out of calling line identification, or CLI, capability. This network development deed will be commercial-in-confidence, as are the Optus and Vodafone network development deeds. It will, however, include an annex outlining the major developments, and this will be tabled in parliament. Clearly, there is also room for improvement in Telecom's relations with its customers. A positive, non-adversarial approach is obviously preferable. I have previously welcomed Telecom's decision to implement the recommendations of Austel's report on the COT cases, particularly those recommendations on customer complaints. Austel has already reported that Telecom is instituting new customer complaint handling procedures as recommended by the independent Coopers and Lybrand study. In addition, Telecom will be asked to produce quickly a customer charter detailing, in plain English, what Telecom's customers are entitled to expect in terms of service. It will include clear information on the position with regard to liability, compensation and customer privacy. Telecom will settle appropriate wording for the charter with Austel, the Trade Practices Commission and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs. The charter will be effectively communicated to customers through bill inserts, public advertisements and other means after consultation with consumer groups and relevant government agencies. Of equal importance, internal staff training will emphasise the importance of the charter to Telecom staff, with particular emphasis being placed on the representation of liability and customer privacy. I will also be encouraging the other carriers to follow Telecom's example and adopt a customer charter. Honourable members will recall that I have expressed concern that cost remains a barrier preventing many Australians from having a home telephone service. New measures to deal with affordabiIity are currently being discussed with Telecom in consultation with consumer and welfare groups, and I will be announcing details shortly. It is important that the telecommunications regulator, Austel, has adequate resources to deal with consumer complaints. To this end, I have requested that Austel establish a special unit, headed by a general manager reporting to a designated Austel member, to manage network performance issues, quality of service and customer complaints about difficult network faults and related privacy issues. This unit will meet with complainants on a regular basis and endeavour to ensure that all matters are dealt with quickly. Some concern has been expressed about the carriers' liability for their actions. Telecom's statutory immunity from suit was removed completely by the Telecommunications Act 1991; that is, it is now in no more nor less favourable a situation than other carriers in Australia or, indeed, other companies. Telecom will be asked to expedite the implementation of relevant recommendations in Austel's COT report to ensure that it does not misrepresent the extent of its liability to its customers. This will be done through revised instructions to staff, internal training and appropriate public information, including the proposed customer charter, with Austel overseeing this process through the new unit I have mentioned. Austel will shortly commence a public inquiry into the setting of limits on amounts recoverable in tort in relation to an act done, or an omission made, in relation to the supply of a specified basic carriage service. This will enable all interested parties to make submissions on the practical application of carrier liability. The protection of customer privacy by telecommunications carriers is an issue of the gravest concern to the government. We are determined that this will be reflected in the policies and actions of the carriers. Honourable members will recall that in January I asked the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to review the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to determine whether amendments were necessary to limit the breadth of the exemption given to carrier employees. As a result, the Attorney-General will be introducing amendments to the act to clarify the exemption for carrier employees. I am pleased to say that the stringent new privacy guidelines developed by Telecom at my request and in consultation with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman and the Privacy Commissioner have now been adopted by Optus and Vodafone as well. Telecom's proposed external audit of its privacy policy will be published as well as tabled in the parliament and made available to Austel for prior scrutiny. I have also asked Telecom to open discussions with the relevant unions to achieve amendments to the necessary awards to allow any internal Telecom disciplinary proceedings involving allegations of privacy breaches, including allegations of voice monitoring and recording, to be required to be chaired by an independent party. In addition, Telecom will be asked to appoint an independent party to review existing disciplinary procedures, including those that should apply to all levels of management. In relation to the allegations of Mr Bray, I have asked the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to review the privacy aspects of those allegations, particularly in relation to Telecom's privacy guidelines. Broader privacy issues will be able to be considered by the Austel Privacy Advisory Committee that I announced recently. I have asked that priority be given to the disclosure of customer information, particularly silent number information. The use of the Freedom of Information Act by the COT complainants during the arbitration process disclosed the need for Telecom to review how it dealt with FOI requests. Telecom will be asked to ensure full implementation of the major reforms to its freedom of information procedures that were indicated as a result of that review. Such implementation is already under way, including centralised control to ensure prompt handling of requests, a network of FOI coordinators, standardised handling procedures and improved staff training. I will be indicating to Telecom that I would expect it would implement any recommendations that the Commonwealth Ombudsman might make with regard to administration of the FOI Act. I am advised that the fast-track arbitration procedures for the first four COT cases have been settled and the secondary arbitration procedures for the next 11 COTtype cases have been substantially settled. I will ask the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to report to me, on conclusion of the arbitration, on any findings of general application to the telecommunications industry that he has made as a result of the arbitration process. In establishing whether he can make any findings, he will consult with the arbitrator and the other consultants involved in the process. With regard to the permanent arbitration procedures for settling claims, Telecom will be asked to finalise the rules for these as a matter of priority. Austel's quarterly reports on COT implementation and carrier quality of service will be tabled in the parliament, and I will table Austel's first quarterly COT report and the quality of service report for the March 1994 quarter at the end of my statement. After the receipt of each COT quarterly report, I propose to request the chairman of Telecom to detail measures to address any concerns which Austel has identified. The government's recent reforms to government business enterprise reporting and operating arrangements have increased GBE accountability, and I am discussing with members of the Telecom board ways of enhancing their reporting arrangements to government. I can assure honourable members that the government is committed to having all of these network and customer issues dealt with in a positive and open manner. I am confident that the arrangements I have detailed here wiJI ensure this happens, and will provide proper parliamentary scrutiny of Telecom's future actions. In closing, I would like to thank Senator Bourne for raising her concerns about Telecom's service performance and for assisting the government to respond to the needs and concerns of Telecom's customers. For the information of honourable members, I present the first quarterly report on progress of Telecom's implementation of recommendations of Austel's COT cases report and Austel's quality of service bulletin for the 1994 March quarter. NA Political Accountability",88
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The need for the Government to ensure high standards of accountability, recording of donations and ethical behaviour in the use of political funds. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",91
123,Mr FILING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This has obviously become another matter of some controversy for the Labor government-the second time around, as a matter of fact. I know that, for those members who were present in the last parliament, there is a certain amount of deja vu in the way in which WA Inc. has come back to bite at the Labor Party in federal government. I would like to refer to the answer given yesterday by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) to a question asked by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). As honourable members may recall, the honourable member for Tangney asked the following question: From the point of view of a donor to a campaign fund, what is the difference between a candidate using campaign funds for the purpose of paying the candidate's private debts, for which Parker was convicted of stealing, and a party using campaign funds to pay the candidate's private debts? In his answer, the minister said: I have no knowledge of the facts of the matter raised by the honourable member, but I will certainly have those investigated. It may well be that there has been some breach of the legislation so far as third parties failing to file returns is concerned. As far as I am concerned, a payment that is not related to an election is obviously not something that should be included in the return. Having seen that response in black and white in the Hansard, I took the trouble to look at the Commonwealth Electoral Act and, in particular, section 314AB, which states: Subject to this Division, the agent of each registered political party and of each State branch of each registered political party must, within 20 weeks after the end of each financial year beginning on or after I July 1992, furnish to the Electoral Commission a return, in an approved form setting out: (a) the total amount received by, or on behalf of, the party during the financial year, together with the details required by section 314AC; and (b) the total amount paid by, or on behalf of, the party during the financial year, together with the details required by section 314AD; and (c) the total outstanding amount, as at the end of the financial year, of all debts incurred by, or on behalf of, the party, together with the details required by section 314AE. It was of some note yesterday that the minister in the first instance started his question by acknowledging the fact that he was the minister responsible for that particular act. The Electoral Commission was obviously playing for time. The minister did not know. He was not fully aware of the requirements of the act for which he was responsible. It seems logical as a result of some of the activities under the name of WA Inc. and other state Incs on behalf of the Labor Party that the minister is perhaps less than knowledgeable about the requirements of the act. Having seen the behaviour of Labor governments in the various states and, in particular, in Western Australia, it is not surprising that there is such a low level of knowledge of the requirements of the Electoral Act. About halfway through the last parliament, for those who were here and remember, the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, was obliged to come back into this chamber and apologise for misleading the House over his answer to questions about the now infamous gold tax luncheon. Mr Hawke said: ... I seek your indulgence to correct an answer I gave to the House earlier today and, in doing so, to apologise for my incorrect recollection as to sequence of events in 1987 involving a decision not to impose a tax on gold ... when I provided the answer to the House earlier today, my recollection was that the Government had made no firm decision ... on this matter before the luncheon in question. We now know only too well that that admission severely winged the previous Prime Minister at a time when he was being consistently undermined by his then potential successor and now Prime Minister. The gold tax luncheon became infamous for the million dollars that was committed by various business people from Western Australia to the Labor Party, in particular for the re-election of the federal Labor government at the 1987 federal election. Connell said-he was one of the donors and gave $250,000-that the donations were like a toll for doing business in Western Australia. He said: I don't think anybody gives donations to political parties willingly. It certainly has not been my experience. He made the point that the money was not a donation; it was more like an extraction. It was no coincidence that 12 weeks after the payment of this particular donation the Western Australian government bailed out Rothwells. Mr Cleeland-Tell us about the 500 club.",91
124,Mr FILING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Here is somebody who comes from the state where we had the corrupt Cain-Kirner administration, an administration that bankrupted a state. That member must accept responsibility for that as part of the party that kept Cain and then Kirner in government for so long to the detriment of the people of Victoria. You have the gall to sit there and laugh and interject when you know that it was the Cain-Kirner Government that was responsible for the reduction in services and lack of funds needed to maintain the basic services of government thanks to all the money it threw away during its period of administration. Let us tum now to Mr David Parker, the former Deputy Premier of Western Australia now languishing in a prison in Western AustraliaMr Cleeland- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise the a point of order. You and all members of this  criminal charges in the state of Western Australia. I understand that those matters written of in the newspaper arise out of the Western Australian royal commission. Because he faces criminal charges, the matter, according to conventions of this House, is sub judice.",92
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am sure the honourable member for Moore is aware of the sub judice rule and, as he has not got on to anything about the person in question, I cannot rule in any way.",92
126,Mr FILING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have had this time and time again as we have tried to expose these dealings to the House. In the adjournment debates the member for MCEwen and other members have stood up constantly to try to use the sub judice rule to silence us. What are they scared about? They are scared about the fact that WA Inc. now has the former Premier and former Deputy Premier languishing in prison. These two characters were described in the 1980s as the wunderkinder of Western Australian politics. David Parker was the great white hope following Mr Burke. 'Burkey' was made an ambassador by the very government that sits opposite us and in the end was required to stand down, was sacked from that position, only when it became quite clearly apparent to every single member of the community that Mr Burke had acted corruptly. Now he languishes in a prison in Western Australia. Mr Cleeland- Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: the standard text on proceedings of this House, which we all know about, states that the sub judice convention is to prevent any comment which may reflect upon a person facing criminal charges and which may cause problems in the mind of the jury. The honourable gentleman is drawing conclusions on the character of a person who is facing criminal charges.",92
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! There is no point of order. I again remind the honourable member for Moore. I know that he understands the sub judice requirements.,93
128,Mr FILING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am going to talk about the charges for which he has been convicted. In relation to the charges for which David Parker has been convicted and imprisoned, Judge Clarke commented that David Parker regarded the donations as 'sweeteners falling short of bribes'. He went on: To say that the offences are a product of the era  ground and training failed to inoculate him against contamination by those of low or no moral fibre who led him into high places and showed him rich pickings. The thefts took place when the elders of the ALP espoused the precept that electoral victory was an end to justify the means. Those are damning words indeed. They related to the man who held the second highest position in the Western Australian government. Of course, he followed the man who held the highest position in government in Western Australia-former Premier, Mr Burke. Let us make it absolutely clear that the  probably not ever have come to light had it not been for the royal commission. Mr Cleeland- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the charges faced by Mr Parker arise out of the royal commission. The charges of perjury result, as I understand it,  evidence concerning the use of the campaign funds. The matters are interrelated. By referring to the royal commission, he is bringing matters into the debate which are not proper.",93
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! On 27 June the Speaker, following an inquiry from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), made a statement on sub judice. It was: As a general rule, matters before the criminal courts should not be referred to from the time a person is charged until a sentence, if any, has been announced; and the restrictions should again apply if an appeal is lodged and remain until the appeal is decided. The honourable member for Moore has been very careful to couch his remarks in terms of an earlier criminal charge, but I would ask him to confine his remarks to those and not enter into any other criminal charge that is before the court. That is my ruling on the sub judice point.",93
130,Mr FILING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have now been robbed of about seven of my 20 minutes. In the end, Parker and Burke would not have been exposed had it not been for the royal commission. Those of us who were here during the of last parliament will remember that night. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and I spoke. It was a night when the ombudsman of the Western Australian parliament went to the Legislative Council and tabled a report that called for a royal commission. Until then the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), who now passes herself off as being pure, had to be dragged kicking and screaming to go anywhere near a royal commission. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), who is in the chamber now, was involved in the ALP in Western Australia at the time. He is a former state secretary of the ALP. It was quite clear that, had it not been for the fact that the Western Australian opposition had applied so much pressure to the Western Australian Labor government, we would not have had a royal commission. But let us look at accountability, because that is part of the matter of public importance. Let us look at what the member for FremantIe who used to be the Premier of Western A-stralia, had to say at the royal commission in response to three crucial questions. She was asked: In July to November 1988 did purpose and effect of the government involvement in PICL was fully and accurately explained to the public? A. Cannot recall. Q. Did you attend a Cabinet meeting in abo-t !uly  discussed Rothwell's current financial position? A. No recollection. Q. During 1988, the SGIC and GESB each supported Rothwells to the extent of $50 million. Please state when you first became aware of such support being proposed or having occurred? A. No direct knowledge. Is it not surprising that whenever this subject is raised here in the chamber she squirms in embarrassment? I have watched her body language when she has been in the chamber and I have seen that she gets embarrassed. She squirms because this is the bite of Western Australia Inc. coming back into the federal parliament to attack the very people who were involved with it in the first instance. In the last few moments, because I have been robbed of so much time, I will refer to one particular allegation that has arisen as a result of the Parker trial; that is, the question of the use of campaign funds by the ALP to pay off the gambling debts of a state member of parliament in Western Australia. That particular member was believed to be David Smith, the member for Mitchell. In this day and age of accountability, when we have had the members on the opposite side of the chamber calling for more accountability in the past, how is it that a political party was able to justify the use of campaign funds to pay off the gambling debts of one of its members? Mr Ronaldson-The Minister for Justice.",93
131,Mr FILING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The person who used to be the Minister for Justice. This has been an absolute travesty. It is still not over. Two of the most senior members of the Labor government in WA are now in prison. (Time expired),94
132,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was very disappointed that the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) did not come to the subject of the matter of public importance at all, so I will read it to you believe that the the House: The need for the Government to ensure high standards of accountability, recording of donations and ethical behaviour in the use of political funds. That raises two policy issues of significance to this chamber. Firstly, it goes to the regime we have in place for the disclosure of political donations and, secondly, it goes to the requirement of members of parliament to declare their pecuniary interests. You have a gall to come into this place and talk about confidence in the system as a result of those regimes! Let us have a look at the history and the structure of policy on disclosure of political donations that has been before this parliament over the last 10 years. When we were elected to office in 1983 we implemented the first disclosure of political donations regime in this parliament, and you opposed it. You were dragged kicking, shouting, scratching and screaming. You did not want to have one bar of it. Let us remember who established the Commonwealth regime for disclosure of donations-we did. You opposed it, and you continued to oppose it in the course of the 1980s. We established the disclosure regime, but you did not accept the spirit of it. You did your best to avoid it. You did your best to evade it. You did your best to ignore it. You did your best to scupper it and scuttle it. We discovered a range of loopholes. What did we do? In 1991-92, as a result of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report No.4, we extended the provisions of the act by way of legislation. What resulted? There was a more effective disclosure of donations regime and you were again dragged there kicking, shouting and screaming. You wanted to rely upon avoidance and evasion and to continue to rort the spirit and the letter of the act and the law. That essentially remains your position today. We established the regime and extended the coverage of the act. The history of the disclosure regime in this parliament is quite simple. We have supported it, we always have, and you have opposed it on every single occasion. We have discovered in the course of work on the joint standing committee that there may weIl be a further loophole which you are currently taking advantage of, but I will come to that shortly.",94
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I ask the honourable member to refer his remarks through the chair and be careful of his use of the second person.,95
134,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Forgive me, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let me also make some comments in respect of Western Australia because my Western Australian coIleague the member for Moore made some points about our state. What has occurred in Western Australia so far as disclosure of donations is concerned? The Liberal Party in Western Australia through the corrupt state upper house has opposed the establishment of a disclosure of donations regime time and time again. FinaIly, after the royal commission, it enabled disclosure of political donations legislation to be enacted by the parliament. That regime was not proclaimed prior to the last state election in Western Australia and it remains unproclaimed to this day. You have sat on that unproclaimed act for 18 months at the state level and you have refused to proclaim it. Why? Because your attitude in this parliament is reflected by your attitude in the Western Australian parliament. You do not support a disclosure of political donations regime. The failure and the refusal at the state level to proclaim that act has been in the face of consistent requests by the opposition in Western Australia to do so. Mr Truss-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Repeatedly you have advised the member that he should not make allegations saying 'you' having failed to proclaim various legislation. The member has continued to do so and I suggest that he is in breach of your ruling.",95
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! I remind the honourable member for Perth of my earlier advice to him: it would be better if he modified his use of the word 'you'.,95
136,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am grateful for your helpful advice on two occasions, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will do my best to follow it. The policy point is quite simply this: at the Commonwealth and state level the opposition has persistently refused to support disclosure of donations legislation. The second policy point goes to the disclosure of pecuniary interests of members of parliament. Again, when we were elected in 1983 we supported the resolution of this House which has the effect that the pecuniary interests of members of parliament be disclosed. What did members on the other side do? You opposed it. When we tried to effect a pecuniary interests disclosure regime for senators, what did you do? You opposed a regime in the Senate that would have had the effect of senators disclosing their pecuniary interests. The same thing occurred in Western Australia. In the course of the 1980s the Labor Party in Western Australia introduced into the state parliament legislation which would have had the effect of requiring members of parliament to disclose their pecuniary interests. Repeatedly in the corrupt upper house in Western Australia the Liberal Party opposed and defeated the establishment of that regime. We have seen that attitude reflected in the last week or so by the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). I refer members opposite to an article in the Financial Review. Mr Truss-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.",95
137,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think I have got it. I would ask the honourable member for Perth just to be a bit careful about his terminology, to address his remarks through the chair and speak about third parties.",95
138,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I refer you and honourable members opposite to an article in the Financial Review on Thursday, 15 September entitled' ASC demand on Downer company'. The story, written by Christine WaIlace, states: The Leader of the Federal Opposition, Mr Downer, is a director of a company whose 1990 annual return is stiII under ""requisition"" by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) for failure to satisfy all the commission's requirements. It refers to the Leader of the Opposition's company Marybelle Pty Ltd-an appropriate name for a company that he is involved with-and states: Mr Downer also appears to have breached Parliament's pecuniary interests guidelines laid down to shed light on MP's private business interests. It goes on to refer to some of the comments that the Leader of the Opposition has made in respect of the completion of his disclosure of pecuniary interests required by the House resolution. It states: An underlying resentment to the disclosure process was revealed in the comment made above his signature in 1987: ""This is an invasion of privacy."" Above his signature in the 1986 return is the annotation: ""This is a gross invasion of privacy."" That reflects your attitude. Members opposite will not support a regime which has the effect of requiring effective disclosure of political donations, and they will not support, at either the state or the federal level, the disclosure of pecuniary interests of members of parliament. I referred earlier to a worrying possibility that a loophole continues to exist within the disclosure of the political donations regime of which the Liberal Party is currently taking advantage. I refer to an article in the Financial Review on 8 June 1994 headed 'Big loopholes for secret funds for political parties'. Tim Dodd writes as follows: The Australian Electoral Commission has warned a parliamentary committee of loopholes in the disclosure laws which could allow substantial funds to be secretly channelled to parties without being revealed. The article refers to a submission made by the AEC to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, of which I am a member, and further states: In its submission, the commission said it was possible for a political party to have companies, trusts and organisations that the party controlled that largely benefited the party. These could be used to channel party transactions not included in the annual return. Here we have the Liberal Party potentially using trusts to avoid the disclosure regime. A further story in the Financial Review of 7 June, referring to the Labor Party's submission and stand on this issue, states: But Labor's submission also argued for closure of a loophole in the disclosure law which deals with income received by a political party from a trust fund. ""It appears that it is not necessary to disclose donations to a trust fund where the trust fund income is then consumed by a political party while the donation remains untouched,"" Labor's submission says. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, 1 raised these matters with Mr Lynton Crosby, who is the Deputy Federal Director of the Liberal Party. In the official Hansard report of the hearings of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on Tuesday, 7 June 1994, 1 asked Mr Crosby the following question: Just finishing up on the trust funds, you referred earlier to the legal advice that your party had received on trust funds. Do you know whether your party has received any advice from accountancy firms in respect of the same area? Mr Crosby replied, 'I am not aware.' I then said: In the course of the election period, your party disclosed, I think, something like a million dollars in kind for services provided by accountancy firms including KPMG Peat Marwick. You would not know whether part of those services entailed advice on trust funds? Mr Crosby answered, 'No, I am not aware at all.' Senator Minchin then interjected: I think I can say with confidence that all we got, as we said, was legal advice. It was QC's advice; it was not from an accountant. That did not necessarily satisfy us because, on this side of the House, we have the healthy suspicion that the Liberal Party is using trust funds to avoid disclosure. 1 refer to a proforma letter that has come into my possession dated May 1994, addressed to the Free Enterprise Foundation, c/- KPMG Peat Marwick, or GPO Box 292, Canberra, ACT, 2601. There is no question that this has all the hallmarks of a suspicious Liberal Party front. The proforma letter states: Dear Sir, Please find enclosed the Company's cheque forblank space; fill in your own amountrepresenting a gift to the Foundation. In making this gift the Company requests that the funds represented by it not form part of any gift to a political party or be used for any other political purpose prior to the next Federal Election. Acknowledgement of this gift in due course would be appreciated. Yours faithfully, That is the big loophole that we are now concerned about. Recommendation 6 of the June report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled Financial reporting by political parties states: . .. that part XX ... of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to clearly require disclosure of income received by registered political parties from any trust fund or similar fund or account, where such income is above the disc losable amounts set out in the Act. That is what we suspect you are up to. Do not come in here pretending to have clean hands on this issue or any policy structure or policy integrity in these matters whatsoever. The honourable member for Moore-my colleague from Western Australia-made some points about Western Australia. I also want to make a couple of points about Western Australia. Members opposite make reference to the royal commission in Western Australia, but they never make any comment about the failure and refusal of the current Court state government to implement fundamental recommendations of that royal commission. There are a couple of recommendations which are pertinent to this debate, none of which were mentioned by the honourable member for Moore. One of the recommendations contained in the report of the royal commission concerns an inquiry into the pecuniary interests of MPs. No action has been taken on that recommendation whatsoever. A further recommendation of the royal commission in Western Australia was to proclaim the declarations of donations legislation. That has not occurred. The government has refused and sat on the unproclaimed act for 18 months. I want to refer to a media statement issued by the Western Australian shadow minister for electoral reform, Mr Jim MCGinty. His press release of 19 September 1994-just a couple of days ago-states: The Lawrence Government passed the Electoral Amendment (Political Finance) Act 1992 to fix the problem. It is the Liberal Party that has not moved on. Cheryl Edwardes continues to stall on reform and is refusing to proclaim the Act. The opposition has raised this issue 7 times since the last election and we are still yet to see the Act proclaimed. On June 3 1993 Mrs Edwardes said ""appropriate' action will be taken during the parliamentary sitting"" and on September 8 last year she said tIthe Government will deal with the matter in a proper way as a matter of urgency"". Over a year has passed and nothing has happened. The honourable member for Moore should not pretend that, in addition to having no policy fabric whatsoever, he comes to this argument with clean hands. Let us have a look at a few things that have been occurring in his local bailiwick. A story on the front page of the Sunday TImes entitled 'Lib MP's account probe' states: Police are investigating the possibility of allegedly corrupt payments to former Wanneroo mayor Wayne Bradshaw were cashed through bank accounts controlled by Liberal MLA Wayde Smith. This is a state colleague in the very area of the member for Moore. There was a financial inquiry into that state member's financial affairs, which the Premier of that state refused to disclose. On 17 November 1993, the West Australian stated: ... the report was taken out of Mr Court's office by Friday October 29-the last working day before WA's Freedom of Information Act became law. That is your standard of accountability, transparency and openness. You have no policy structure in this area. You have no standing. You do not come to this debate with clean hands, and you have the absolute gall to talk about confidence in the system and disclosure of donations!",95
139,Mr CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will comment very briefly on the suggestions that the WA government is dragging its feet in some way. In Western Australia we have legislation which we want to be perfect because members of the Labor Party proven that they will do all they can to escape the law. The Liberal Party has nothing to fear from these laws, but the Labor Party does. The federal electoral commissioner has stantly told the Western Australian Attorneyserving General to hold back on legislation until similar laws are enacted in Canberra. It is also ironic that they failed to mention that Bob Hogg, who was once admitted to the feder-l Labor Party, also sought to find loopholes disclosure legislation so that they did not to make all the declarations required. The is theft. Labor Party has two faces, and one of them is very ugly and very corrupt. The calls for this legislation have only come about because certain members of Labor Party have been found to be crooks. They need legislation to be kept honest. Without legislation, they cannot be honest. They cannot self-regulate. They need I.as and they will find that they have pretty stIcky fingers. Even then, they will try to find some loopholes. The Court government will not provide them with any loopholes. Members opposite trying to deflect criticism to the Liberal Party will not work. It must be redecade. membered that calls for this legislation have come only because the Labor Party is full. of corruption. In fact, the Western Australian Labor Party and corruption are pretty well synonymous, and you know it. You are pretty well embarrassed about it too. We have a former Labor premier and a former Labor deputy premier in prison for the misappropriation of funds. That alone is despicable, but it is only the tip of the iceberg as far as moral bankruptcy, political corruption and criminal behaviour in the Labor Party go. Mr Bevis-You haven't heard of the sible Queensland National Party! Mr Thckey-Don't raise that. They didn't lock Joh up. Mr Bevis-Why? Mr Tuckey interjecting Mr Bevis-Only three of his ministers.",97
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE, dates. Order! The parliamentary secretary and honourable member for O'Connor will cease have having a private discussion.,98
141,Mr CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This past week some very revealing evidence came out of the court case of the former Deputy Premier of Western  - 12-month prison term for his misappropriation of campaign donations. It was revealed during his trial that Parker used campaign donations to pay off personal debts such as the renovation of his kitchen and In bathroom, his wife's tax bill and his morthave gage. That, it has been decided by the court, We also have in prison in Western Australia  was also found guilty of misappropriating the funds. I will not comment further on Mr Burke. He is a very close friend of many people opposite, including the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), but apparently not of the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) because there are other charges pending. The imprisonment of these two criminals is just one chapter in an encyclopaedia of moral and political corruption in the ALP which has permeated that party in the past During the trial of David Parker, the President of the Senate, Senator Beahan, who was the secretary of the state ALP at the time these offences were committed, admitted that the ALP committed the same crimes as Parker. Parker is in gaol for using campaign funds to pay for personal expenses including house renovations, his wife's tax bill and his mortgage-and that was theft, as the court pointed out. During the trial in which Parker was convicted of this misappropriation, Senator Beahan admitted that the ALP-and in saying 'the ALP' I assume he was responfor he was the administrator of the party at that time-committed the same offences. At the time Senator Beahan was the administrator the ALP was committing the crime of theft, quite frankly. The ALP was using campaign funds to pay for the bank overdrafts of candidates, the gambling debts of candidates and holidays for the families of candiParker did similar things, and today he the languishes at Her Majesty's pleasure. These are very revealing and, quite frankly, worrying admissions which need investigation. In the meantime, Senator Beahan, who has been implicated in this, ought to stand down as President of the Senate. We had members of a political party at the time these offences were occurring administrating the funds of the state which they were governing. The fact is that they could not even legalIy administer their own campaign donations, so how on earth could they administer the state's funds? Throughout this sorry saga we alI know as WA Inc., prominent members of the ALP have been totalIy supportive of Burke and Parker. In July, Ian Taylor, the Labor leader in Western Australia, professed his love and support for Brian Burke. He did not condemn him for being a crook. He said he loved him. I notice the member for Fremantle said she hardly knew Burke, but I recall when she became the Premier of Western Australia she had David Parker in her backyard supporting her. Her silence has been deafening since Parker was gaoled. I must ask: does she love and support Parker, or does she condemn what he did? We have had a number of Labor politicians coming out and supporting Burke and Parker, but only one has condemned them. That person, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr CampbelI), has been described by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) as a man who talks nonsense. The member for Fremantle probably distanced herself from Burke because she was found in a similar situation. Back in 1989, before she toppled Peter Dowding for the premiership, with the assistance of the now member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), the member for Fremantle received $5,000 of public money to finance an overseas trip related to her then portfolio matters. Did she take the trip? No. Did she keep the five grand? Yes. She paid it back a couple of years later but not until she had gathered a nice sum of interest. Mr Bevis- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 76 makes it an offence to renect poorly upon a member of this House or the other chamber. I believe that the contribution being made transgresses standing order 76. If the member wishes to pursue the argument which he is now advancing, there are forms of the House to enable him to do so.",98
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! On the point of order understanding order 76, the honourable member for Stirling should be very careful not to impute improper motive. I think he should take great care.",99
143,Mr CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you for your direction, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will only point out that that extra five grand did tum up in her bank account. She said she did not. notice it was there. AlI I can say is, 'Oh, to be in a position not to notice an extra five grand in your bank account.' I was not aware the honourable member had won Tattslotto recently. Brian Burke must be wondering to himself, as he languishes at Her Majesty's pleasure, what he did that Dr Feelgood did not do. It is a shame that members opposite condone the corruption of the Western Australian Labor Party, but then again members opposite do make strange bedfelIows, do they not? Some years ago, Brian Burke ran the printing and publishing of a welI-known racing guide in which he employed a number of friends, including the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) and Senator MCMulIan-two present federal ministers. Why have they not condemned Brian Burke and David Parker? The tentacles of WA Inc. are spreading themselves over a number of members opposite and it is not surprising that, instead of condemning Burke for his actions, they are professing their love and respect for him. Why has the Prime Minister not come out berating members of his party who have been corrupt? Perhaps it is the fact that his good mate Warren Anderson was a close friend of Parker and employed David Parker. Remember the royal commission into WA Inc? Parker told the royal commission in 1991 that before he went to Hong Kong he did some work for property developer and large scale contributor to ALP funds, Warren Anderson-a friend of the Prime Minister's. It seems that WA Inc. should be renamed Australia Inc. The stench of WA Inc. has drifted from St Georges Terrace across the Nullarbor, and you can get a whiff of it from the ministerial offices. The Labor Party is in a mess. It has two former leading figures, both of whom, it was suggested, had bright futures in the party, now languishing behind bars. The party organisation and members opposite are implicated by their association and their refusal to condemn the crooks from their party. Senator Beahan, who is as involved as Parker in misappropriating campaign funds, stands condemned.",99
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member will withdraw that comment understanding order 76.,100
145,Mr CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw. Instead of berating Parker for his misuse of party funds, what did Senator Beahan do? He said, 'Oh, yeah, we did the same as Parker with our party funds.' He has no right to be President of the Senate and, as I said before, he should stand down. Mr Bevis- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is simply not permissible for a person in this House to make those sorts of assertions against a senator in the other house. If he wishes to pursue an argument that the President of the Senate should be dislodged from that position, that is a matter which requires a substantive motion.",100
146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The honourable member for Stirling will continue, but he will be very careful on the extent to which he makes comments about members of another place.",100
147,Mr CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"When the member for Perth was state secretary, he did nothing to change the ways to recoup the money or to identify criminal activity within the Labor Party in Western Australia. When the member for Fremantle was in the cabinet room, and subsequently Premier, her lips were sealed. She never sought the truth, she never wanted a royal commission and she never tried to distance herself from Burke or Parker. The Labor Party is infested with corruption and immorality. The Western Australian Labor Party has brought shame to members opposite. Mr Chynoweth- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The comment that the Labor Party is infested with corruption is not correct and I ask for it to be withdrawn. I am not corrupt. I am a member of the Labor Party.",100

150,Mr CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, bearing in mind that there are two former members, or members, of the Labor Party in gaol, I would have thought",100
151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! Withdraw, please.",100
152,Mr CAMERON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw. As I said last night, the squeals of guilt are so loud that I rest my case. (Time expired)",100
153,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"A few weeks ago there was a National Party conference in Canberra where they had a fairly jolly time. As Laurie Oakes reported in the Bulletin of 20 September: The high point came with a group of Young Nats dancing about on one leg and trying to put the other foot in their mouths in a musical Downer impersonation. They were chanting: ""I can play the Downer,"" they sang, as a chorus chanted, ""Foot in mouth, foot in mouth."" That is what we have had in this debate today. The hide of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) to come in here and lecture the Labor Party about disclosure laws! Every time we have tried to pass disclosure laws in this House-going back to the late 1970s, 1984, 1992 and 1993-we have been opposed by the Liberal Party in this House. You have a consistent position of opposing disclosure of donations. You have opposed it consistently. There is currently a loophole in the law, which the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) spoke about before, which has been abused by your side of the House. I know that your national secretary, and the secretaries of the Liberal and National parties right around Australia, would be acutely embarrassed by the performance you have put on in this House today. Mr Truss- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The honourable member for Lilley has described your performance as being disgraceful. I suggest that is a breach of the standing orders.",100
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! I caution the honourable member for Lilley in the same way I cautioned the honourable member for Perth. In his introduction, the honourable member for Lilley described a group of people and then went on to use the word 'you'. Please be careful about the use of 'you'.",101
155,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Those opposite are opposed to disclosure of campaign donations. They have continued to oppose the disclosure of campaign donations even in Queensland in the post-Fitzgerald era. When we amended the Commonwealth Electoral Act in 1991 and 1992 to make all money received by political parties disclosable-whether for election purposes or maintenance purposes-that was opposed as well. But you decided that you would go out into the community and try to find a loophole. You went out and said to the business community, 'Why don't you donate some money to a foundation; if you do that, the interest received on that money will not be disclosable.' That was the advice that you gave to the business community.",101
156,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member has just got his words wrong. He said the Liberal Party; it was the Labor Party that did that with three-quarters of a million dollars that your Prime Minister raised in Perth.",101

160,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They think they have found a loophole in the disclosure legislation. I have a letter before me, which is a standard letter they have been sending out, with the heading 'KPMG Peat Marwick'. That organisation is the custodian of the Free Enterprise Foundation in Canberra. You have advised businesses right around Australia to donate large sums of money to foundations like the Free Enterprise Foundation. You have received the interest from that money, and you have done so, I believe, in breach of the disclosure legislation. So you have been receiving, corruptly, money in breach of the disclosure legislation. Mr Tuckey interjecting",101

163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I hope people will not think of me unkindly, but I was distracted at the time. I would ask the honourable member for Lilley to address his remarks through the Chair and be careful with his use of the word 'you'.",101
164,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will be more careful, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is an open secret in the business community in Sydney that the Liberal Party gave advice to the members of that community that, if they donated large sums of money to foundations, those donations would not be disclosable as long as the principal was not forwarded on to the Liberal Party; in other words, if the interest payments and other income from those funds went to the Liberal Party, it was not disclosable. It happens to be my view, which is yet to be tested in court, that that is a breach of the current disclosure legislation. I hope that at some time in the future that will be tested in court. This all means that you have received, corruptly, in breach of the disclosure legislation, moneys to run your party and recent election campaigns.",101

Might I suggest that you suggest to him that he sit down permanently, as I think he has breached the ruling too many times.",102

170,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Fortunately, arising out of the deliberations of the Select Committee on Electoral Reform, proposals are before the government to abolish this practice. There is a recommendation before the government that part XX of the Commonwealth Electoral Act be amended to clearly require disclosure of income received by registered political parties from any trust or similar fund or account, where such income is above the disclosable amounts set out in the act. That brings me to what has occurred in recent times in terms of political donations. In the year to 30 June 1993, the coalition parties received in total income $8.4 million more than did Labor. Think a little bit about that. That is the sum total of all moneys received by state and federal branches of the Liberal Party on the one hand and the Labor Party on the other. This is information which comes from a consolidation of all of the disclosures which currently apply through the Commonwealth Electoral Act. You have been receiving your normal income",102
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order!,102
172,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Those opposite have been receiving their normal income plus interest income from those foundations. That figure demonstrates the extent to which the Liberal Party has been involved in a rank abuse of our disclosure laws. You sit there day in and day out,102

174,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Sorry; those opposite sit there day in and day out saying that the Labor Party has plenty of money- 'the unions fund your campaigns; you haven't got any worries about money.' That is not the case. These figures prove conclusively that those opposite have been massively bankrolled by the business community-so much so that, when we look at the expenditures of the last election campaign and the cost of running the state and federal offices of the Labor and Liberal parties, we see that the Liberal Party spent $8.4 million more than Labor, whilst wandering around the place with its officials moaning and groaning about the disclosure legislation and how it had prevented them from raising funds in the business community. What it really means is that the Liberal Party was prevented from raising funds in the business community legitimately, so it went out and raised them illegitimately. That is what the Liberal Party has done. It will not be long before the facts and figures are before the Australian people and everyone will be able to see the extent to which the Liberal Party has tried to evade the purpose and intent of our disclosure laws. You simply do not believe in them.",102

The problem is that the Liberal and National parties do not believe in the law; they do not believe in disclosure legislation. Brian Burke would not have been the first premier to go to gaol in this country's history if it had not been for one person on a jury in Queensland-so do not forget that. We have had the experience of the brown paper bag syndrome in Queensland delivered by the Liberal and National parties who still in that state consistently oppose disclosure laws at the state level.

185,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Refurbishment of Australia House, London. The proposal to be referred to the committee comprises the implementation of a staged program of internal refurbishment providing tenancy conditions which meet the requirements of occupational health and safety, the replacement of outdated and obsolete equipment, and office accommodation which meets current data and communication needs, and the refurbishment of areas surplus to high commission requirements for leasing to state governments. Australia House is a 75-year-old building which is in need of substantial refurbishment. This, coupled with increasing levels of vacant space, has provided the opportunity to strategically review its future representational role. In the 1994-95 budget the government approved expenditure of $14.25 million over the next three years to undertake a comprehensive program of internal refurbishment, subject to normal Public Works Committee processes. Over the years, various parts of Australia House have been renovated on an as required basis but no comprehensive renovation program has been undertaken since it was completed in 1917. Whilst the exterior has been comparatively well maintained, the interior condition is variable. Many of the building services are at the end of their safe and useful life. Much of the existing office accommodation is in poor condition and does not meet the needs of current working environments. Economic evaluations have been carried out on all practical options. The most cost-effective solution for Australia's representative accommodation in London is the retention and upgrading of Australia House and the development of the Australia Centre concept with state occupancy. The total cost of the proposed refurbishment is estimated at $14.25 million, based on May 1994 prices. I commend the motion to the House. Reference Question resolved in the affirmative.

186,Mr TUCKEY,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"O'Connor) (5.09 p.m.)The International War Crimes Tribunal Bill and the International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) Bill, which have come from the Senate, were introduced quite some time ago. I put my name down to speak on these bills because I wished to express my abhorrence and concern at the genocide and death that was occurring throughout the country which we all once knew as Yugoslavia. Whilst the situation has apparently moderated somewhat during the efflux ion of time that it has taken in getting this bill into this place, I have taken the opportunity as a listed speaker to continue to speak on this legislation. Other members have already drawn to the attention of the House certain aspects of this legislation. In his second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney General (Mr Duncan) said: The purpose of the bill is to enable Australia to comply with binding international obligations which were imposed by the United Nations Security Council on 25 May 1993, when it adopted resolution 827. That resolution established the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Fonner Yugoslavia since 199), and adopted the statute of international tribunal. This is extremely important legislation of a unique nature, in that it gives power, under Australian law, to an international tribunal which may at some time need to caB upon Australia to deliver to it an Australian citizen. A substantial number of one-time citizens of Yugoslavia are resident in Australia, some of whom I believe have returned to Yugoslavia from time to time in order to involve themselves in the conflict. So any suggestion that this law will not be applied in Australia is not true. I sincerely hope that it will not have to be applied. I am not suggesting that any person has been involved. However, it is clear that Australian citizens certainly have had the opportunity to be involved in that conflict and thus could be in a position of being charged in some way. As I said, this legislation is unique. It applies to·one of the most tragic situations that I have ever witnessed. Its timing is amazing, considering that next year we will be talking a lot about the Second World War. I commend the government for allocating funds to remind the many Australians who were born after the Second World War of what occurred. I remember the war as a child, although I was too young to be involved as a soldier. However, I was old enough to know that there was great fear in Western Australia as parts of our state were bombed. I experienced trench training and so on when I was at school. Of course, my experience as a child is really as a button off my shirt when compared with that of others who have experienced some of the horrors that have occurred in parts of Yugoslavia in the name of ethnic rights. I think it is tragic. I wish to say-and I would have liked to have said this earlier when it would have been relevant-that, notwithstanding the difficulties of the terrain and all the other associated issues, I do not think the international community used enough muscle to try to resolve this conflict. Evidence indicates that, every time a little bit of air power has been used, the process of peacemaking has been substantially improved. I regret that it is beyond the resources of Australia to settle a dispute of this nature and that we can only rely upon the great powers of Europe, as Yugoslavia is part of that continent, instead of waiting again for the Americans to be involved. I am aware of all the problems associated with retaining peace arrangements with the Soviet Union. But the simple fact is that every time a little bit of superior air power was used massive steps were taken in order to achieve some sort of resolution which saved a lot of people's lives. One of the great tragedies is that international opinion and international power could not be used to save the lives of so many adults and children. I guess one could say that what we are doing today is a case of closing the door after the horse has bolted. Here we are debating a United Nations resolution, a very proper resolution, that just happens to deal with the effects of the connict-not the conflict itself. I wish to make a couple of comments about the background to the legislation. I have already drawn to the attention of the House the fact that this is another binding international obligation. As one who criticises many of the so-called binding obligations, I must say that this is what I perceive as the role of the United Nations and particularly its Security Council. But I regret that it was not more positive in its response to this conflict. We are finding ourselves passing a unique law in this country which empowers a foreign tribunal to conduct itself on our territory. It may require us to deliver people to other countries in order to provide information to the tribunal. From my understanding of the legislation, a person found guilty may not necessarily be imprisoned on our soil. I am not objecting to any of that. I believe that the only thing worse than war is war crimes. It is most unfortunate that we have a set of rules under which people can go out and kill other people. But, while people continue to do it, we need some laws. Charges were laid against a young man who went out and raped and murdered someone. I was horrified that that could happen and be justified by commanding officers and others who, I think, instructed that young man that he could behave in that way, as opposed to telling him to behave in that way. We thought that we saw the end of that sort of behaviour with the holocaust, yet there are grave similarities; it is just that in this case gas chambers were not used. These things sadden me considerably. It is interesting that the member for Banks (Mr Melham) said something with which I agree wholeheartedly. I will have to watch out; my reputation will be in tatters if I keep this up much longer. Mr Bevis-The member for Banks isn't coming out of this too well, either.",104
187,Mr TUCKEY,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"The member for Banks might be worried about this, but I will use his words to my advantage. During his remarks he said that we have one of the best democracies in the world. I would say that, notwithstanding my concerns in a certain area, that is absolutely true. I recently said that we have one of the most highly developed democracies in the world, which is probably closer to what the member for Banks wanted to say. Why do we constantly feel obliged to make promises to the rest of the world in some formal convention or treaty when we do not need to? We could say, 'Wait a minute. Our democracy and our democratic development are such that you don't have to ask us that question; we've done it. We are a country that practises democracy in as advanced a state as anywhere.' We do not need to make promises to parts of the world which have not recognised, for instance, that it is grossly unfair, not improper, to employ five-year-olds or to enslave people. Why should we be the first in the queue to commit ourselves to some of these issues in a way that eventually has implications on our own law? In his second reading speech, the parliamentary secretary told us one of the reasons why we have to pass this legislation. I am sure the government is presenting the bill to the parliament with the best possible principles, because it stands where I stand on the issue of war crimes. But the government is telling us that, because of a commitment made to the United Nations and because of our involvement with the Security Council, this House has no choice but to pass this legislation. As I said, I have no objection to the legislation. But I am concerned that Australia is progressively going to this international organisation, signing conventions on issues which, in most cases, we have addressed decades ago or which we have the full capacity to address at any time should public opinion decide that we are recalcitrant. We do not need to sign conventions with other countries to be told that we have to do something about particular issues. That point is fundamental to this debate. I know at times that people come in here and smirkingly say, 'I am bringing in this law to meet an international obligation, but ha, ha, I've got you.' That is probably the lowest aspect of this issue. I do not like the deals we do with other countries around the world being used to override the fundamental constitutional laws of Australia because I believe that we have a provision for that as well. Our democratic process says very clearly how we will address our constitution if the people of Australia are unhappy with its provisions. It is not set in concrete. We should not go away and commit ourselves. It is almost an admission that we are not good enough and that we really do not know how to run our country. We are making a promise to the rest of the world that we will be better children when we lead the world in human rights and in many other areas. It is interesting how these laws that we accept from the United Nations can be adminif istered and interpreted differently in different countries. An issue we will have before us here shortly relating to Tasmania is apparently a major problem in our eyes. However, a law to cover it applies to the majority of states in the United States. I do not want to comment on the rights or wrongs of the legislation. But why did that international body, in criticising Australia in this way, not have something to say about the great big United States, the USA? The reason might be that the USA pays the bills. But we have to look at the fundamentals of this. Why, as a small country, do we put ourselves in a position where we can get instructions from afar? These conventions become quite concerning, because they can be abused-as any law will be abused-if it is in somebody else's interests to find a way to do so. At the moment, we are contemplating desertification legislation, having just fought our way out-in a minuscule way, I guessof the outrageous approach that the world community took to agricultural trade, which is at least now included in the GATT. Having many battles before us, we are now seriously considering handing to a committee of the United Nations the power to tell us how much land we might farm. We could be back here in a matter of years confronted with some legislation, the purpose of which the minister might tell us is to enable Australia to comply with binding international obligations. We will not have to worry about drought relief. We will have to close down pastoral properties because somebody has taken some aerial photographs or somebody in another agricultural producing country has thought it a damned good idea to reduce the competitiveness of highly efficient Australian farmers. To me, that is silly. It is doubly silly on the grounds that we pretty capable managers. We do take account of these sorts of circumstances. If everybody believes the claim of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), which is that we have a right to independence, the decision to close farming land should be kept as a decision of this parliament and, possibly more importantly, of the people who elect us. We have already signed the atmospheric pollution convention. We now find ourselves being confronted with whether we have an obligation-we probably do-to tax our own industries or deny them carbon power. Anything generated with a hydrocarbon should be increased in cost in some way. We do not want people to use it because we have agreed that we should not pollute the atmosphere. That is fine, but a lot of our trade competitors will not bother about it or are too big and mighty to be bullied. One might wonder how many people will be out of a job in time because we made a commitment to the world with a lot of hype. There was a lovely warm glow and lovely feeling for the minister in this case as she walked on to the podium and was applauded. She added a signature to something that read pretty well until she came back here in the face of cold, hard reality and asked herself what it would cost Australia. I do not want to make any outlandish comments as to what it might cost Australia. But it is clear that we are now under international pressure to meet our promises and reduce our economic activity unless we can find some other form of power generation. It is a bit of a worry. The greenies do not like hydro-electric energy any more. Even Peter Walsh tells us that it is probably the cleanest energy form. Everybody is dead frightened of nuclear energy. I know about solar power and all those sorts of things, but you cannot run a factory on solar cells. You cannot create significant jobs with it. You can run a little pump or an electric fence or something. The serious question is how we get around that commitment. This is very interesting because it deals with the courts. Concern was expressed in the second reading speech as to how far this are tribunal might seek to go. We are conceding great powers to a body that is a bit out of our control. But the courts are out of our control, and properly so. They are getting a momentum of their own. I drew to Mr Speaker's attention-I wanted to make sure the Attorney-General knew about it-a case recently lost by the Commonwealth where a convicted drug importer was able to defeat a deportation order on the grounds that he would be leaving behind his two Australian born children and that that would be to their disadvantage. The judge ruled that he was right and that if the Commonwealth were to deport him it would be in contravention of its promises and commitment to the international community under the rights of the child convention. I have been told-I have heard Attorneys General in this place stand up and tell usthat we really do not have to worry about these warm, fuzzy glow conventions we sign every now and again because they have no meaning in Australia until we write a law. There is no law that says that convicted drug importers should not be deported because of the international convention on the rights of the child. As I said, the law has a momentum of its own. I wonder whether that was the intention of the government at the time it signed it. Did it believe its own rhetoric that we did not really have to worry about this warm, fuzzy glow stuff because it did not really have any effect until we passed a law here in Australia? It clearly does. It has a lot to do not so much with what you might do as what you cannot do. I am very worried that we might shortly be committed to something that says we cannot farm, or certainly farm to the extent that we do today. I take this opportunity to draw to the attention of the government the question of whether it is right. The other conventions are signed, and we bear their problems. I agree that they were not all signed by Labor governments. But it does not change the fact that we often make commitments. This is another one, and it has my endorsement. Treaties are about national security and things of that nature, where the executive should have the power. You cannot debate a treaty defence while your enemy is knocking at the door. But we have gone too far. I warn the House that, in talking with governments, we should be pretty careful. (Time expired)",106
188,Mrs EASSON,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"The International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994 is concerned with the moral basis of our nation. This matter has received a great deal of discussion in our community and generated tremendous passions. It would be useful for the House and the public record for the background of this matter to be laid out clearly and concisely. In 1985 in the USA, a certain Conrad Kalejs was arrested by the American authorities. The US courts were satisfied that Mr Kalejs had falsified his immigration application to the USA in respect of his record of activity in eastern Europe during the Second World War. As Mr Kalejs had migrated to the US from Australia, he was deported to Australia. At that time-in 1985-there was no legislative basis for dealing with the mass murderers of the Nazi holocaust who were hiding in Australia. In early 1986, a series of meetings were held between political leader: of all parties and the organised communitie from eastern Europe. Representatives of thl Jewish, Ukrainian, Polish, Croatian and othe Baltic communities agreed unanimously that after the Kalejs affair, Australia was dutbound to consider all options to deal witl individuals who have war records that makl them unacceptable to Australia's multicultura society and democracy. The US courts accepted that Conrad Kalej: was a member of an auxiliary police force that assisted Nazis in murdering Jews. Mem bers of the House will remember that this race policy was Hitler's primary war aim and the pursuit of it was carried on to the bitter end contrary to even the most basic milital] considerations of conducting war.

Thousands of persons, male an< female, outside Germany were prepared t< assist the Nazis in these horrors. Conra< Kalejs was one, and in 1985 Australia wm unprepared to deal with this political an< moral crisis. Many voices are raised against the existencf of this legislation. I am willing to accept thai most criticism may be based on a view of lawhich precludes victors putting the van· quished on trial. The key point in this view h that both sides in war end up committinatrocities, yet only the vanquished are sent tc trial. No-one can deny that atrocities werf committed by the allies. The bombing 01 British and German civilians in their homes. as distinct from war supply factories, was grievous atrocity perpetrated by both sides. However, the shock in May 1945 of the full extent of Nazi crimes was so overwhelminB and extraordinary that public opinion in the world demanded the punishment of the leadership of Nazi Germany. Members of the House will remember that, although bombinB civilians can easily and truthfully be classified as an atrocity, no German was charged with bombing London, Antwerp or Warsaw. The charges related primarily to the Nazi policy of genocide, and this genocide was directed towards the Jewish people in response to the child. As I said, the law has a momentum of its own.

Obtaining evidence and documents vital for court proceedings will be very difficult in relation to the Yugoslav crisis. However, the crimes are disgraceful and we must have a process whereby we can take action if we decide to do so. The laws we have on this matter are laws in defence of human rights. The post Second World War society has been increasingly attuned to human rights. Today, we see violations of human rights as a danger to world peace. International communications are such that enormous crimes can be televised into homes around the world within an hour. This fact will result in a great disturbance to the peace of the world. It therefore follows that nations individually and collectively through the UN will seek to act against serious violations of human rights anywhere in the world. This legislation, before it arrived here today, was examined by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The committee chairman, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), has done an excellent job and helped significantly to clarify and sharpen our response in this most important and difficult matter. I would like to speak to a few of the more pressing points in the report and the draft legislation. The International War Crimes Tribunal has been established by United Nations Security Council resolution 827 and a subsequent statute. Australia is party to this establishment, and the tribunal will be empowered by this legislation to sit in Australia, receive assistance from Australian legal authorities and have its forfeiture orders enforced by Australian law. Clause 4 of the bill defines the tribunal as 'the international tribunal for the prosecution of war criminals from the former Yugoslavia or any of its associated organs.' Thus this bill is only concerned with Yugoslavia. Evidence of genocide elsewhere cannot be dealt with by this bill when it is enacted. This narrowness of definition is not a good thing. Unfortunately, the crimes in the Balkans are not the last example of anti-human atrocities. We can confidently expect more in the future. Perhaps the Attorney-General could look at the question of empowering an Australian court to deal with any accusations of atrocities against human rights brought against a person within the legal jurisdiction of Australia. No-one here would be happy to see a person in Australia accused in relation to the genocide in Rwanda go free because there was no competent court to deal with that person in Australia. This is a problem for the future. It is a real problem, and I am confident that we will have to face it. Clause 12 of the bi1\ wi1\ require that a person arrested under it be brought before a magistrate and that the magistrate must be satisfied that the person before the bench is in fact the person named in the warrant. This question of identity is a central point to all recent trials of war criminals connected with the second world war. It is interesting to note that no accused ever denies the charges; they always deny that they are the person named in the warrant. In future years, when this legislation is used to prosecute someone in Australia they wi1\ also deny not their crime but their identity. Natural justice requires that serious efforts be made to avoid accusing an innocent person, and the benefit of doubt in questions of identity must always be resolved in favour of the accused. This bill is about justice, not vengeance. The bill incorporates a recommendation from the Melham committee that a specific statutory scheme for legal aid be included in the bill. The government recommends that applications for assistance be directed to the Attorney-General, who may determine whether legal aid is to be granted. This provision is necessary as an accused may be a person of modest means, wholly unprepared financially to meet such serious court costs. As all matters dealt with by this biII when it becomes legislation wi1\ be involved with genocide and the worse kind of horrors, we must not alI ow procedural delays based on money to disrupt the quick settlement of the accusations brought against any defendants. The advisory committee chaired by the member for Banks recommended a sunset clause. The government has rejected this recommendation in favour of a review in five years time. I believe that this is wise. Our need for national order and regularity in the country, with many people from lands disturbed by war, means that the government must not tie its own hands in relation to matters which 10 years hence may create major social disruption. I assume that no-one in this House has family who have been subjected to any of the horrors of the wars in the Balkans, but certainly many of us have constituents who have suffered directly and indirectly. We must use our imaginations and not think that these matters are like football; that everything is over when the whistle blows. The horrors of genocide, be it in Nazi Europe, former Yugoslavia, Rwanda or anywhere in the world, never leave the victims while they live, nor their families, for generations. Our legislaface tion should realise this and we should be prepared to deal with these matters over the long term. The effects of genocide are certainly long term. In concluding, I would ask the House to remember the unbelievable horrors of the Nazi holocaust and believe that a repeat is possible. Remember Pol Pot in Cambodia. Remember Rwanda in 1994. Remember Bosnia as we speak. The trial of the Nazi leaders at Nuremberg was not held just to establish their guilt and to decide whether to punish them for committing crimes; it was part of a search for a better way to control those strong human impulses of aggression and revenge. It was an attempt to replace violence with an acceptable and effective rule of human behaviour, a rule of law. When the eight judges of the military tribunal entered the Nuremberg courtroom at 10 o'clock on 30 September 1946 more was expected of them than a judgment on 22 individuals. In bringing those Nazi leaders to judgment, some hoped for vengeance, some for a just basis for a post-war settlement of Europe. Others hoped for a solution to problems which have plagued civilised nations for centuries. With this bill, Australia in a small way becomes part of this solution. I commend the bill to the House.",109
190,Mr WILLIAMS,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill and the International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) Bill. Members will recall that the bills were referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs by the Attorney-General. I hasten to add that it was at my suggestion in my former capacity as shadow Attorney General that that was done. I spoke briefly on 30 June when the committee report was tabled. I am very pleased to be able to speak now, when the government's response has been received and the bills have been amended in accordance with the committee report and the government's response to it. I welcome the government's response because it generally accepts the committee's recommendations. I think there is only one recommendation not accepted, which is not on the of it a matter of huge consequence, and one recommendation that is only partially accepted. That is a matter on which I will comment. It goes without saying that the quality of the report and the response of the government to it reflect well on the decision that the matter should be dealt with by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As I said at the time of the tabling of the report, those involved in the preparation of the report are to be commended. At that time the chairman made particular mention of the staff who had been involved. I think it needs also to be mentioned that the quality of an advisory committee report on a bill will frequently be a direct reflection of the quality of the evidence offered by the witnesses. In this case, as in the case of the report on the child sex tourism legislation, the quality of the input from the witnesses who proffered advice to the committee was very high. The object of the legislation is to enable persons alleged to have committed crimes against humanitarian law in the former state of Yugoslavia since 1991 to be surrendered to the international tribunal in the Hague for the purposes of trial. The bill basically is a procedural one, setting out the means by which a person who is a citizen or resident or temporarily in Australia can be arrested and surrendered to the tribunal. In the making of the reference to the standing committee, and in the proceedings before the standing committee, it was the unanimously agreed object of those involved to ensure that the procedures were appropriate. It is a serious matter that one country would surrender a citizen, a resident or a person within its territory to an authority outside that territory, and appropriate safeguards are necessary to ensure that the arrest and surrender are not arbitrary. The bill in amended fonn will largely reflect the committee's view of what safeguards are appropriate. It will take into account the sorts of safeguards that are applied under the extradition act, although it will not be a direct mirror of extradition act provisions. I refer to only three recommendations of the committee. Recommendation 10 recommends that a provision requiring an additional step between the initial remanding of a person and the Attorney-General's surrender decision be inserted into the bill. The committee recommended that it should require a person to be brought before a magistrate, who must determine whether a person is eligible for surrender. The criteria should be that the magistrate is satisfied that the person is the person named in the tribunal warrant and that the alleged offence for which surrender is sought falls within the jurisdiction of the tribunal. In making that recommendation, the committee had regard to legislation or draft legislation of other countries that were responding to the security council resolution establishing the international tribunal. In paragraph 1.8.2 of its report, the committee refers in particular to legislation in Italy under which there was an appeal to a court which could address the question of physical identity, a matter that the government accepts is appropriate to address, and then the question of whether the surrender request is in relation to a matter which falls within the temporalthat is, the time-and territorial jurisdiction of the international tribunal. The committee also referred to proposed legislation in the Netherlands under which surrender could be refused on the identity ground but also on the ground that surrender has been requested for offences over which, under the tenns of its statute, the tribunal has obviously no jurisdiction. The committee's recommendation has been accepted in so far as the magistrate involved in the remanding may address the question of the identity but not accept the question of jurisdiction. In its response, the government points out that, under the rules of the tribunal, jurisdiction can be dealt with before the tribunal. I for one accept that it is appropriate that issues of jurisdiction should be dealt with by the tribunal. In the end it may not matter much that the particular point made by the committee has not been picked up. I say that because in another recommendation to which I will come in due course, recommendation 21, the government has accepted a recommendation that the process be subject to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. While I am certainly not going to offer any legal opinion on the point, there is an issue of whether a request for the surrender of a person which, on its face, shows allegation of an offence outside the time, or outside the tribunal's territorial jurisdiction, is a request to which Australia can respond. This issue may well be ventilated on a judicial review application. I do not know the precise answer at this point. I have not made the study, but the recommendation, I think, was a reasonable one. For my part, I would prefer it to have been adopted. It would only involve the rejection of a request which, on the face of it, was obviously defective. Recommendation 20, which the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) referred to, provided that further consideration be given to developing an appropriate sunset clause in relation to the legislation. The government has pointed out in its response that there are difficulties in developing an appropriate sunset clause and has in fact responded positively to the recommendation in giving further consideration as requested. The government has decided against a sunset clause, but has undertaken to cooperate with parliament in conducting a review of the legislation, including the continued need for it, five years after commencement. I do not know what bring-up mechanism the clerk operates within the parliament, but I would strongly recommend that there be put down, for a date five years after the commencement, a reminder that the parliament has an undertaking from the government to undertake such a review. I doubt, with the sorts of schedules most members have, that many, if any, would remember to conduct the review or to raise the matter of the review five years after the commencement of the legislation. The last recommendation to which I invite attention is recommendation 21, relating to the application of the judicial review act. The judicial review act has become one of a very important group of sources of potential remedy available to a citizen in dealing with the government. It is a process which has proven invaluable in most areas in which it has been exercised. It has been exercised across a wide range of administrative decisions under Commonwealth statutes. In the light of the experience of judicial review, there should, I think, be a very good public interest case made out for excluding it before any enactment should include a provision eliminating judicial review or even restricting it. I am very pleased that the government has decided, after careful consideration of the recommendations of the committee, that this is not such a case. I will make only two more comments. One is a specific comment related to legislation in general and the other relates to this particular legislation. This particular bill is a very special one in the respect that it deals with allegations of crime committed overseas and what may be done with persons within Australia who are alleged to have committed those crimes. In other respects it is yet another bill coming before the parliament in which the citizen is to be subjected to the coercive powers of the state. We have had quite a range of bills in the last 12 months, some dealing with what might be described in broad terms as police powers-powers of entry, search, seizure and arrest and intrusion in the form of telephone tapping and similar exercises. We have had a number of bills in which there are coercive powers of a more regulatory nature involving perhaps entry to premises, inspection, examination, copy or seizure of documents, and interrogation of people. This particular legislation emanates from the Attorney-General's Department, as has some of the legislation to which I have referred generally. The introduction in the legislation of coercive powers is, of course, nothing new and has been on the statute books for as long as there has been legislation, but the intrusions that are now being authorised by the parliament are beginning to become very widespread. We do not only have the more commonly observed ones of taxation, trade practices and corporations and securities regulation; we have also extended into other fields, such as health. I have in mind, in particular, two pieces of legislation relating to the Health Insurance Commission, conferring coercive powers on that body. In past times, the Attorney-General's Department has largely been the guardian of civil rights in the preparation of governmental measures. In recent times, we have seen new bodies created that have specialist responsibilities in relation to human rights. We have a Privacy Commissioner, a Sex Discrimination Commissioner, an Administrative Review Council and, even within the parliament, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. All of them have some role, albeit minor, in the preparation and enactment of legislation. It would be a sad day indeed if the Attorney-General's Department, because of the special roles of these other bodies, abdicated its role as the principal guardian of human rights in the preparation of legislation. It was quite alarming to see the legislation that emanated from the Department of Human Services and Health relating to the Health Insurance Commission. I would be extremely disappointed if I ever thought that had been vetted and approved by the Attorney General's Department before being submitted to cabinet. There needs to be a better, more widespread approach to the development of coercive powers of government and the spread of intrusions. The time is right and the opportunity is there for that to be done. This legislation is a partial response to horrific and disgraceful conduct in former Yugoslavia. For all we know, this conduct may be continuing. I hope and trust that this legislation, and legislation like it in other countries party to the United Nations Security Council resolution, will be used where necessary to bring to account-whatever their race-people involved in genocide, ethnic cleansing, mass rapes, murders and the other crimes that have been committed in former Yugoslavia. I hope that the international cooperation involved in the setting up and operation of the international tribunal will convey the message widely that anybody who commits such heinous acts will be condemned by the international community and punished appropriately.",111
191,Mr LINDSAY,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (6.02 p.m.)-I am indebted to honourable members for their contributions to the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill-in particular, the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) and the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), a distinguished Australian lawyer and Queen's Counsel. This bill has the support of many members on both sides of this House. It will do much to ensure that the administration of justice on this particular subject is profitable angst. and efficient. This bill has had a long genesis. At the of the former Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, there was great debate in the Australian community and in the House of Representatives on what action would be taken by the Australian parliament to bring those people who had committed war crimes, particularly during the Second World War, to justice. As a result of those discussions, the Australian government of the day took strong action by passing legislation to ensure that those war criminals who had been identified could be pursued and, if possible, arrested, charged and brought to justice. A lot of effort was employed and cost incurred by the Australian government in the pursuit of those war criminals and in bringing them to justice. That, in itself, attracted criticism in the Australian community. This legislation is a watershed in that it received the support of members on both sides of the House. It was also referred to a parliamentary standing committee. The member for Tangney mentioned that the amendments are all in response to the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. He referred to the fact that the government has agreed to accept all but two of the committee's recommendations and part of one recommendation. This bill will bring credit to the efforts of the Australian parliament and the Australian people and will ensure that justice is done in this area. I commend the bill to the House.",114
192,Mr RONALDSON,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"Ballarat) (6.06 p.m.)It gives me a great deal of pleasure to speak on the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill this afternoon. Although I was not anticipating doing so, I welcome the opportunity. If we took a random poll around this country of things that mattered most to people in a global sense, I suspect that war crimes would probably be very much on the top of that list. War crimes are probably an effrontery to all decent minded people in this country-indeed, right throughout the world. The horrific nature of the war crimes that we have seen, certainly in this century, has caused many people much Knowing the atrocities that were perpetrated time on the Jewish communities worldwide and the extraordinary levels of brutalisation of people, I hope that I will never see that sort of thing again in my lifetime, and that my children and their children after that never see it in their lifetimes. There could not be one person who would not have a gut wrenching view of what was perpetrated on those people. My learned colleague is anxious to speak on this matter and I will now give him the floor.",114
193,Mr CADMAN,INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES,"I am the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. We were required to do an advisory report on the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill 1994. Whilst I was not a member of the subcommittee that did some the detailed examination, I came into the latter stages of the committee's consideration. I am pleased that that committee, in examining the legislation passed to it by this parliament, was able to make some recommendations that were sensible, constructive and, as honourable members commented in the House today, acceptable and conducive to the improvement of the legislation and the way in which the Australian government and the Australian people respond to an international tribunal in which we are participating. The processes that the United Nations will adopt in establishing a tribunal at which war criminals will be brought to trial have been described. The world community has agreed that, more or less, mirror legislation will be passed by contributing nations. Should war criminals or suspects be brought before the tribunal, those countries will be asked to supply distinguished judges to participate. The thing that has exercised my mind is whether there has been an automatic surrender of Australian sovereignty in this process and whether by some international agreement we cease to have control over people who may be residents or citizens of this country. When examining the government's proposed legislation, the House of Representative Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was careful to look at whether there would be a loss of sovereignty and a loss of control by the government over its own citizens. The committee has come forward with recommendations that will strengthen the legislation and ensure that there is no loss of sovereignty for Australia and that criminals will be dealt with within a system that recognises the unique and open legal system that we have in Australia, which is one of the fairest systems in the world. It is not the proposal of the government or the opposition to hand over a citizen to an international tribunal that will then, under terms and conditions outside the control of the Australian government and the Australian people, make a decision whether or not that person is a war criminal. It is a recommendation of the committee that a number of amendments be made to this legislation to ensure that Australian citizens are not picked up in the way the government was proposing for the war crime trials, which came to an inglorious stop because no-one could be found to fulfil the requirements laid down in previous war crimes trials. Members of the House will be aware that $12 miIIion was spent looking for World War II war criminals in Australia. Basically, that search proved to be unsuccessful. Even if people under strong suspicion were found, it was almost impossible to bring a conviction because they had to draw on evidence which was 40 or 50 years old and came from countries outside Australia. They had to try to get witnesses to appear in Australia and positively identify the people whom they claimed were the perpetrators of those war crimes. This is a different matter. The International War Crimes Tribunal Bill is an international attempt to prevent war crimes continuing without the criminals being brought to book. The UN is looking at the events in the former Yugoslavia to see whether or not people who have perpetrated war crimes can be identified and how they are dealt with. The tribunal's intentions are patently clear and it is obviously up to each country to interpret the extent of the obligations and their domestic implementation. The committee took the comments of the tribunal seriously in that regard. The Acting Deputy Prosecutor of the tribunal, Mr Blewitt, made the point: Whilst a\1 States are under a strict obligation to cooperate with the Tribunal and to comply with its requests and orders, it is nevertheless a question for each State to enact implementing legislation designed to bring their municipal legal system in line with requirements of the Statute. It is a matter for States to comply without undue delay with any request for assistance from the Tribunal and the Tribunal will not seek to interfere with the way in which this occurs. It is very clear that the International War Crimes Tribunal is saying that it is not in a position to dominate domestic law in the same way that countries handle suspected criminals within their countries. The committee felt that the Attorney-General's Department had been too willing to forgo Australian sovereignty. We ask the government to build in the checks and balances that the House is now debating. We felt there was a need for magistrates not just to take the word of a policeman or an investigator that an individual standing before them is in fact the war criminal identified by the tribunal. We believe that magistrates must in their own minds establish beyond any doubt that the individual before them is the person desired to be called before the international tribunal. We have placed a responsibility on magistrates and the courts to establish beyond doubt that that individual is the one so identified by the international tribunal. We cannot have the situation where an international police group comes in with an identikit of somebody it wants to cart off to an international tribunal, pulls that person into a court and says, 'We have found the person,' and the magistrate automatically signs the document because the police have said that that is the person they are seeking. Australia must consciously forgo its hold on that citizen, its protection of that citizen and the sustenance of that citizen. Recommendation 4 of the report states: The Committee recommends that clause 8 be redrafted to indicate that requests from the Tribunal must be in writingIt is not good enough if a telephone message from an international group in Geneva or elsewhere-and I know that my colleague at the table, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) understands this-is received which says, 'You Australians need to comply with some on high directive from an international tribunal.' That is just not on. The committee has stated that all requests need to be in writing. The report goes on to state: ... and be sufficient to identify for the accused and the Australian courts the person or persons to be charged, the nature of the charge and the intended time and place of the hearing. That all needs to be up front and in writing. It is the committee's wish to retain our identity, our sovereignty over our citizens and our obligation to our residents. The report further states: The Committee recommended that clause 9 be redrafted to clarify that the Attorney-General is obliged to issue a notice stating that a request has been received from the Tribunal only if the request complies with the requirements in proposed amended clause 8. The Attorney-General has to look over the matters and say, 'We have received a valid request from the International War Crimes Tribunal.' That is the proper role and function for the Attorney-General of Australia to play if there is an international request for somebody to face a hearing. The extradition processes are somewhat different from what we have seen before. By the same token, the committee believes that the Australian government stands between its citizens and international tribunals of any sort. The third recommendation to come to my attention is recommendation 7, which states: The Committee recommends that subclause 12(2) be amended to require a magistrate to be satisfied that the person before him or her is the person named in the arrest warrant (issued pursuant to clause 10) prior to remanding that person. I have dealt with that issue. It is a pivotal issue that the magistrate be certain that that is the person identified by the tribunal and that is the person to face the tribunal. I have been going through these recommendations in some detail simply because I believe the House needs to understand that it was not the intention of Attorney-General's Department, nor the government to have such a strong role for the Australian people in protecting citizens or residents. It appeared to the committee, which comprises members of all parties, that the government and the Attorney-General's Department were prepared to stand back and adopt a hands-off attitude to any request from the International War Crimes Tribunal. I believe that this committee has served this House well in ensuring that we do not forgo the protection that Australian citizens have learnt to expect from their legal system. It is no good belonging to a United Nations group which has made laws to override Australian laws and the natural protection of justice that Australian citizens enjoy. This is one of the strengths of our nation. The freedoms that Australians enjoy are precious, and we are not going to have those freedoms submitted to any international tribunal to decide whether somebody should be whipped out of Australia and shoved before a tribunal for a war crime or anything else. Let the proper processes take place, and let they be Australian processes. Recommendation 10 of the committee's report, which further emphasises the point that I am making, states: The Committee recommends that a provision be inserted into the Bill requiring an additional step between the initial remanding of a person and the Attorney-General's surrender decision. After a person has been remanded and is sitting in the cooler or somewhere-the certificate has come through in writing in the proper form; the Attorney-General has said that it is in the proper form; the magistrate has had the person brought before him or her and agreed on a positive identification-we go one step further. We require that a person to be brought before a magistrate is eligible for surrender. Recommendation 10 further states: The criteria should be that the magistrate is satisfied that the person is the person named in the Tribunal warrant, and that the alleged offence for which surrender is sought falls within the tion of the Tribunal. There is a final test. The magistrate must be satisfied not only that the person is the one identified by the tribunal but also that the person named in the warrant is standing before him or her and that the alIeged offences listed on the warrant falI within the jurisdiction of the tribunal. It is not enough for the tribunal to consider that it has the right person before it and that he or she is in Australia but be a bit fuzzy on whether some of the crimes are war crimes. It must be precise. The magistrate, protecting Australia's interests and the interests of its citizens, must be sure that the demands of the tribunal for these particular acts are within the scope of the tribunal making that request. We are asking the Australian legal system at every step to double-check what an international tribunal has previously asked. We are bringing in the Attorney-General to make sure that the original request was sound. We are providing a barrier to the automatic take-out of an Australian that may have committed a war crime. We do not know whether that is the case. A person might fit the description and sound right, but we do not know whether or not that person has committed an offence. This barrier must be put in place to prevent any miscarriage of justice and to ensure that our residents receive from the international community the sorts of conditions and the sort of predictability of Australian law which they are used to. I have spoken somewhat more at length, partly by request, than I needed to make the points that I wanted to make, but they are important points. I believe this is a classic role of an Australian parliamentary committee assisting government and the process of the parliament by strengthening important areas-areas that need to be strengthened-to ensure the sovereignty of an Australian citizen is maintained above any international body.",114

196,Mr LINDSAY,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (6.42 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Departure Tax Amendment Bill 1994, together with the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill 1994, implements the government's decision announced in the 1994 budget to replace the existing departure tax with a passenger movement charge to achieve full cost recovery for customs, immigration and quarantine processing at Australia's borders and the cost of issue of short-term visitor visas. The cost of these services has been calculated as being $27 per departing passenger. In addition to achieving cost recovery for these services, it was also the government's desire that there be a more effective way of collecting the charge. The old system under departure tax involved purchasing a tax stamp, affixing that to the ticket and then having the stamp cancelled by a customs officer as the person passed through customs on the way out of the country. This process added to the red tape that passengers had to go through at what is often a stressful time anyway. The government is committed to achieving further improvements to Australia's already efficient passenger processing procedures and the report of the review of the Australian Customs Service-the Conroy reportgave strong endorsement to the Customs Service's direction in this respect. The removal of the process I have just mentioned is a step towards realisation of the vision for airports of the future. That is why the government also decided to seek the agreement of the airlines to collect the passenger movement charge. While the government is aware that it is common practice around the world for airlines to be required by governments to collect taxes, fees and charges-70 per cent of countries world wide have airlines collecting some sort of charge-the government chose rather to work with the airlines, in recognition of the importance of the travel and tourism industry to this country. The government also gave the airlines a commitment to meet reasonable costs of establishing and running the system. Those discussions are under way at present. The cost recovery initiative is proposed to be achieved by utilising the existing legislative mechanism for departure tax to both levy and collect the passenger movement charge. This bill imposes the passenger movement charge whilst the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill 1994 outlines the mechanism for the collection of the charge pending resolution of negotiations with airlines. The replacement of the existing $25 departure tax with the $27 passenger movement charge will result in the following increases to revenue: in 1994-95, $5 million; 1995-96, $12 million; 1996-97, $13 million; and 199798, $13 million. I commend the bill to the House. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994 The Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill 1994, together with the Departure Amendment Bill 1994, implements the travelling government's decision announced in the 1994 budget to replace the existing departure with a $27 passenger movement charge to achieve full cost recovery for customs, gration and quarantine processing at Australia's borders and the cost of issue of short-term visitor visas. This bill amends the Departure Tax Collection Act 1978 to provide the legislative mechanism for the collection of the passenger movement charge imposed by the Departure Tax Amendment Bill 1994 as explained in my second reading speech in relation to that bill. The replacement of the existing $25 deparently ture tax with the $27 passenger movement charge will result in the following increases to revenue: in 1994-95, $5 million; in 1995properly 96, $12 million; in 1996-97, $13 million; in 1997-98, $13 million. I commend the bill to the House.",121
197,Mr MOORE,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"I am delighted to see you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, in the chair. As an experienced and well-known traveller, you would be no doubt",122
198,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION," Parliamentary Not as well travelled as some say, but let get on with the speech.",122
199,Mr MOORE,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"As a native traveller-we will put it that way-you would appreciate more than most in the House that the govern- $27. ment has put up the charge of your leaving the country on your next trip by $2. Every time you go out of the country there will an extra $2 charge. You will also notice that you will no longer have to queue up to pay departure tax. In the future the tax will picked up by agents. That will be most convenient to you, as a well-known traveller. The opposition does not oppose these departure tax bills. However, we will be shifting proposing an amendment in the consideration in detail stage because the proposed introducincorporation tion date, 1 January 1995, would be right at the height of the travel season. Those in this House-as I look around I see a number of distinguished travellers-would be aware of the inconvenience of attempting to change systems on 1 January 1995. The airlines Tax would not thank you and nor would the public. We are advised that the time of the introduction of the summer timetables tax in October 1995 would be more convenient for the airlines, and there is a minimum immiamount of travel at that time. Some reasonable notice has to be taken of the large number of presales between now and the end of the year. Our proposition would be to go to October 1995 for convenience. As far as money raised is concerned, the hole in the wall will still be there. You are proposing to keep it there at least in the short term. Perhaps the question of money flow does not matter and the extra $2 could just as convenibe raised through the existing system until the airlines can properly accommodate new computer programs and the agents can attest to the $27 charge. Mr Deputy and Speaker, I am sure you will concur.  p.m.)-I have no comment to make additional to the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), in respect of travellers, but I do see them come and go. The purpose of the Departure Tax Amendment Bill, as was pointed out by the Secretary to the Minister for us Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), is to change the name 'departure tax' to the 'passenger movement charge' and to increase the rate of the charge from $25 to I am pleased that the opposition is supporting the Departure Tax Amendment Bill and be the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill. That is a little different from the situation that existed when members of the opposibe tion made some comments on 10 May when the changes in the nature of the charge, the title of the charge and the amount of the charge were announced in the budget. The of the mechanism for collection of the charge from the passenger to some form of in airline tickets will smooth entry and exit from Australia. It will get rid of a considerable irritation. Since the departure tax was originally introduced by the Fraser government, from time to time we have sought through various means to ease the task it involved. There have been changes in the direction in which that money has been used. Naturally, the gnomes of the Treasury and the Department of Finance abhor dedication or earmarking of particular types of revenue for particular purposes, as was put by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) when he headed up the tourism committee in the early 1980s. The collection of the departure tax has, from time to time, been raised as something that we ought to try to ease. It has been a considerable obstruction to passengers on arrival and departure. It is worth looking at the method of collection of the charge. Section 10 of the Departure Tax Collection Act 1978 empowers the minister to make arrangements with a person for the collection of the charge. It is to this end that negotiations are taking place with international airlines for collection arrangements. Ideally-I effect. hope this arrangement can be reached fairly soon-the charge would be incorporated in the airline ticket price with a separate entry on the ticket identifying the nature and the amount of the charge. The collection of the charge in that way will make it much more convenient for travellers. The cost of the existing system has almost doubled in percentage terms compared with that of other systems around the world. The existing cost of departure tax collection is something like four to five per cent of revenue collected, compared with about two per cent in other countries. The measure in these bills which goes to collection of this charge will be required for some 11 million people who will be moving in and out of Australia in the year ahead. measure will increase net revenue to Australia. It will provide sufficient revenue to meet the costs of immigration services, quarantine services and customs services provided to people entering and departing from Australia. i The airlines have agreed in principle to these arrangements. The government has indicated to the airlines that it will meet the airlines' establishment and running costs of the necessary systems. The only thing about which there is some dispute within this place and with some of the airlines is the date of commencement of the new set of arrangements. I will come back to that in a moment. Some 70 per cent of countries include some form of departure charge through the sale of tickets. This new system will bring us into line with most other countries in the worldsome 78 of them. Of the 35 countries that have air links with Australia, some 24 have some form of collection of a government fee or charge at the point of the ticket sale. So we are not doing something different; we are coming into line with the rest of the world. Back in 1981, the honourable member for Fadden was very critical of the cages at the airports collecting money. He said the sensible thing to do was to incorporate that charge into the point of ticket sale or to incorporate it within the ticket itself. After all this time, that approach is going to take As mentioned by the honourable member for Ryan, the objection of the airlines is that the 1 January date poses too many difficulties; the tickets will have been printed. It has been suggested that the commencement date should be October next year. I understand that the opposition is putting forward an amendment to that effect. It would seem to be a sensible approach for agreement to be reached with the airlines as quickly as possible. The government has indicated its flexibility about this commencing date. We may well reach agreement with quite a number of the airlines which ought to be able to move to the new system at some considerable time before October 1995. We would like to see that developed. Personally, I cannot see why we need to have an amendment that locks the This commencement date into October 1995. There are other ways to deal with that problem. The opposition reacted to the budget announcements on 10 May by saying that the government had slugged the tourism industry with $140 million by increasing departure tax. The implication in that statement was that an additional charge of $140 million was imposed on the industry. That was not the case, as has been set out in the notes in respect of these bills. The increase of $2 in the overall charge will add $5 million to revenue in 1994-95 and-as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology said-in the three succeeding years revenue will increase by $12 million, $13 million and $13 million respectively. The claim that the $140 million is a slug to the industry is without foundation. The amount which is being collected now is rightly being collected in respect of the provision of customs, quarantine and immigration services. One rider I would add is that I believe I speak for both sides of the House on this-those services should be provided on an efficient basis, in an effective manner and in a cost-efficient way. It should not simply become a matter of the charges being edged up each time there is pressure for an increase in costs. There has to be a discipline to ensure that those charges are justified and that we are doing it as well as we can. The figures for traffic coming in and out of Australia show that in 1992-93 Qantas carried 39 1/2 per cent of international traffic into and out of Australia. In the same year, there were 9.8 million passenger movements to and from Australia. In 1993-94, the total was 11.3 million. There were 5.8 million arrivals, slightly more than the number of departures5.56 million. A lot is being said about the growth rate of the airline market in the Pacific-it is the fastest growing market in the world. Asia currently accounts for some 30 per cent of world air travel. Its annual growth rate averaged between 11 and 12 per cent in the 1970s and the 1980s. That growth rate has fallen below 10 per cent, due mainly to the slump in Japan-which accounts for nearly 60 per cent of all international air traffic in Asia. The forecast passenger growth for this decade in the Asia-Pacific region is eight per cent annually, compared with a figure of five per cent annually worldwide. That reinforces my opening point that the Asia-Pacific region is the fastest growing airline market in the world, but it is not growing as fast as it has grown in the past. Also, as the base gets larger and larger it is more difficult to maintain the same high growth rates of earlier years. As the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) said on 24 May this year: ... the emerging Asian market has led the way. Arrivals from Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore all doubled compared with February 1993 while the Taiwan and Korean markets increased by over 60 per cent ... arrivals from Japan, our single largest market, grew by over 13 per cent to 65,800. The minister was comparing February 1993 with February 1994. This growth reflects the enduring features of Australia as a safe, friendly and unique international tourist destination. One can say that credit is due to the Tourist Commission, but credit is due also to everybody associated with the international travel industry-everybody in Australia that is providing a service of quality so that people visit Australia and go back and talk about Australia as a desirable and enjoyable place to visit. As Australians, we have a responsibility to ensure that the product we are providing is competitive and that the quality is consistent. We all have a contribution to make. As the opposition supports this legislation, it should have a speedy passage through the House. This legislation will enable us to further improve and to smooth the arrival and departure of overseas visitors and the arrival and departure of Australians. I am pleased to support the legislation.",122
200,Mr JULL,DEPARTURE TAX COLLECTION,"I thank the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) for giving me a few free plugs for the long campaign to get rid of the cages. In that respect, I am pleased to speak on the Departure Tax Amendment Bill and the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill. I acknowledge that something that should never have happened in the first place is finally going to go. Its origin goes back to October 1978. The final report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism, which was headed by me and the late Hon. Frank Stewart, recommended that Australia introduce a departure tax which should be used to promote tourism. But there was a rider in that recommendation that it should be collected by the airlines. The airlines decided that it was all a bit too hard. We went under the cage regime, which we have been stuck with ever since. That is just one aspect of this legislation that the opposition certainly will not oppose. I refer to the proposed amendment of the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). As I understand it, one of the difficulties that the airlines have is that pre-sold tickets which are already out in circulation at the moment will be caught by this legislation. I understand that Qantas has 130,000 tickets in circulation. When the holders of those tickets physically go to an airport, there could be some misunderstanding. We are trying to make the path quite smooth for the government to try to overcome this difficulty. If Qantas has 130,000 tickets in circulation, you can bet that the other airlines probably have an equal number or even more. The prospect is that a quarter of a million tickets could be floating around Australia which will be caught by this legislation. In reality, Qantas will have to do one of two things for tickets to be used after 1 January. It could recall those 130,000 tickets, make an additional charge and reissue them or, as the opposition proposes, it could maintain the status quo with the cages until October next year, which will not result in any real loss of revenue for the government, and require people to pay the $27 as part of the additional departure tax. This amendment is designed to be of some use to the travelling public. It seeks to stop some of that inconvenience and overcome any difficulties. There is no reason the airlines cannot put this into place virtually tomorrow. The computerised reservation systems that now exist around the world are so sophisticated that it is merely a matter of putting in a program to allow for an additional $27. One of the things that I like about this legislation and the way that the CRSs, the computer reservation systems, work is simply that it will be quite up-front about the amount of money required to be paid. It is quite interesting that this bill seeks to replace the existing departure tax with a passenger movement fee. The reality is that, when those tickets are issued, there is a nice little box at the bottom which says 'Tax'. People will know that they are paying that $27. Australia already has a number of airports that are charging their own passenger handling fees. Cairns airport is an example of that. It is a privately operated airport which imposes its own passenger tax. That has appeared on domestic airline tickets, through the computer reservation systems, for many years now. So, in a technical sense, there is, no real difficulty. In the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), I was interested to hear his projection that this will ultimately bring in $13 million per year. I was even more interested to hear some of the projections of the honourable member for Shortland. While not criticising them at all, I think the estimates of revenue are very much under what they will be. I believe that the estimate of the growth of international passenger traffic in and out of Australia is very much under what it will be. I have been criticised in the past for estimating that by the tum of this century Australia has the prospect of 10 million international visitors coming here. It is interesting that the growth forecasts are being ratcheted up all the time. The Australian Tourist Commission is now acknowledging that we will have 7.9 million to eight million visitors by the end of this decade. According to some of the projections and the figures, my feeling is that that figure of 10 million will certainly be reached. One of the most authoritative organisations on economic estimates is undoubtedly the Boeing Corporation, which is a commercial aircraft company. Boeing put out a series of studies on its projected growth figures in tourism and passenger traffic generally. Obviously, that is part of selling aircraft, but these figures have been coming out for more than a decade now. It is quite interesting that its projections for Australia and the Pacific generally have been proven to be very conservative. When I was at Boeing in July, I received a copy of its latest World Market Outlook. What the honourable member for Short land was talking about is quite true. There has been a flattening in the Asian travel market mainly because of the Japanese situation in the Asian market. In this report, the section on the estimate of the major air travel markets from 1994 to 2013 reads: The largest addition to increased air travel will come from travel within the Asia Pacific region. Combining the Intra Asia Pacific, Trans Pacific, and Asia-Europe travel markets indicates that 40% of future growth will come from travel to, from and within this region . . . It gives the following breakdowns: intra-Asia Pacific, 23.5 per cent; North America, 22.7 per cent; and the trans-Pacific, 13.3 per cent. Those figures are quite interesting when lined up with some of the other growth areas. The North Atlantic is only 9.8 per cent; intraEurope is only 11.2 per cent. I refer to the forecasts for the annual growth rate of these markets. According to Boeing, the intra-Asia Pacific is looking at an annual growth rate of 6.8 per cent each year for the next 20 years. The trans-Pacific market is looking at a rate of 6.8 per cent for the next 20 years. They are at the top of the chart. While that includes all of Asia, the challenge to Australia will be to get our fair share of that market. There is some argument within the industry and the government generally as to just how much of this traffic we want. There will be pressure on Australia to develop its infrastructure and have the capacity to accept more of these people whether we like it or not. I believe that we are reaching a stage that is very critical for the Australian tourist industry. Within the next couple of years, we need to decide whether we will be a major player in this market. If we just sit back with what we have at the moment, we will enjoy some of the fruits of international tourism. But the pressures on us to be able to provide more destinations and more infrastructure will be absolutely enormous. In all fairness, we will have to accommodate a lot of that growth not only for our own export incomes but also for the jobs that will be created by the industry. Look at the pressures that are now starting to arise. My colleague from Townsville, the parliamentary secretary, is at the table. He and I have spoken about the development of North Queensland tourism quite often. While Townsville probably does not get the sort of figures that Cairns does, I am sure that he will be interested, because there are huge flow-on effects from the traffic that comes into Cairns and makes its way down to Townsville. One of the authoritative forecasters in Queensland is Morgans, the stockbroking people. Michael Knox, who issues a newsletter every quarter, has come up with some quite interesting figures about what has happened with Queensland tourism through this year and what is likely to happen in the next year. We are finding that in a place like Cairns we have a desperate shortage of accommodation at the moment. Townsville also has a desperate shortage of accommodation. On the Gold Coast, which is looking after international traffic, we are already starting to see a shortage of hotels. While in a place like Cairns there are about three new hotels on the books, the reality is that Cairns and the Gold Coast now need about five. In this breakdown that Morgans have given, it is quite fascinating to see that the growth rate for Queensland tourism to the end of this calendar year will be about 10.7 per cent. There are some staggering figures. It does not really matter where you look at the major markets in Queensland. In Brisbane, for example, this is regarded as a bit of a low season for the tourism industry. The figures on international visitors and other visitors into Brisbane this year will be about 10.3 per cent greater in the September quarter than for the same period of Expo. The peak of Expo 88 was the September quarter. The figures point out that the growth in Cairns during this year is just absolutely phenomenal. Guest nights have risen from 1.8 million per quarter in the first quarter of 1982 to a massive 4.36 million in the December quarter of 1993. Those figures are for all over the state. Look at the physical demand on hotel bed nights in Queensland at the moment. It is really quite incredible to think that, overall, the state has an occupancy rate of 75.7 per cent. That is a huge figure. In the hotel industry, once you start hitting about a 75 per cent to 80 per cent occupancy rate, your hotel is full and you start expanding into another property. As I say, that growth is going to happen whether we like it or not. We have to make sure that at all levels of government we have the capacity to be able to provide the infrastructure to meet those demands. Part of that infrastructure is obviously airports. That is why the ALP conference next week will be so terribly important when the privatisation issue comes up. Quite frankly, I do not think governments have the financial capacity at the moment to be able to provide the airport infrastructure that will be required. There is no doubt that we will have to develop Badgerys Creek. It should have been done years ago. It is a major investment. Look at what is happening in Brisbane at the moment. It has one of the fastest airport growth rates in the world. We have an international terminal that is virtually finished but which will not come on line until the end of 1995. The reality is that the Federal Airports Corporation does not have enough money to finish the job on time. That is not its fault. is the nature and structure of the beast and the fact that the FAC does not have access to finance. A lot more work will have to be done in Sydney. We have seen the work that is going on at Melbourne airport. All these things are putting some tremendous demands on the public purse. The public purse cannot provide them, but they must be provided. The privatisation option is the only real option that we have. In the whole business of airports, all that necessary infrastructure, as immigration and customs, has to be provided. It is an expensive business. Obviously, this piece of legislation will help to provide some of it. Governments at all levels should be making some very hard decisions on just how they are going to meet this major demand of international visitors over the rest of this decade and beyond. There will be tremendous pressure on airports and enormous pressure on roads and on local governments to provide services like water supplies and sewerage. Quite frankly, what worries me is that a lot of these decisions are not being considered. Those decisions will have to be made if we are going to meet that demand. I am sure that the figure I have often quoted is about to be updated. The projections of the world tourism organisation at the moment show that 140 million Asians will be travelling offshore for their annual holidays· by the year 2000. Quite frankly, if we got one per cent of them at the moment, we would find it very difficult to provide the infrastructure for them. Australia will be in demand. It is a great destination. We will not let it go, and the world will not allow us to let it go. We have to make those decisions. In the debate tonight, the honourable member for Short land made reference to a press release that was issued after the budget and the particular announcement about the $140 million that is coming off it. It is true that our passenger service charges are not the highest in the world. Quite obviously, there are airports around the place that have much higher charges than we do. People who travel in and out of Heathrow are paying about twice as much as they are paying in Australia. It The passenger service component of the new airport of Kansai in Japan will be very high. We should also stress that, while we make these adjustments, we have to realise that the tourist industry can be a bit fragile and that it is very competitive. While those demands will be there, we must make sure that we do not price ourselves out of the market. It is a fine balance, and it can be so on a year to year basis. One particular market-such as Japancan decide to reduce its rates. In order to get such them in, we have to make sure that we do not price ourselves out of the business. The opposition will allow this legislation to pass. I sincerely hope that the government looks at the amendment that we propose tonight purely for its convenience. It will not deprive the government of income, but it could provide the airlines with a bit of a safety valve in terms of those tickets that have already been issued. While I hate the thought of having the cages around from the beginning of January next year until the end of October, in terms of the smooth transition of this arrangement, it will help very much indeed. Debate (on motion by Mr Elliott) adjourned. NA ASSOCIATION: RESTRUCTURE",124
201,Mr ROBERT BROWN,NATIONAL ROADS AND MOTORISTS,"I seek leave to table a legal opinion by the eminent John Garnsey QC and his colleague Mr Brian Camilleri. It is a joint opinion provided for Ms Dawn Fraser, Ms Jane Singleton and Mr Richard Talbot and concerns the proposed restructuring of NRMA Ltd and NRMA Insurance Ltd. Leave granted. NA Motion (by Mr Snowdon) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Higher Education Contribution Scheme",128
202,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT,"This morning in the debate on the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 I pointed out the injustice of the pro collection of HECS for first-time graduates in the work force. Tonight I wish to highlight yet another HECS anomaly which is similar to the pro rata payment system and is another example of a petty money grab. For want of a better description, I call it the HECS double take, because it arises out of a situation where people, in clearing their HECS debt, are effectively hit twice with a bill from the Australian Taxation Office. Put simply, under the new PAVE system, people pay additional tax instalments to cover their anticipated HECS debt for the following year. But when that debt is reduced to zero the Taxation Office fails to openly advise people to stop paying their tax credits. The result is that people pay off their final HECS partially twice, and those tax credits are not attributed until the following tax year. Let me cite an outrageous case. Mr Kevin Turner, a policeman at Bargara near Bundaberg, in the second half of 1992 completed a full-time six-month advanced certificate in policing at Griffith University in Brisbane. He accumulated a total HECS debt of $1,146. In 1992-93, he earned less than the yearly threshold, so his HECS was held over. In 1993-94, his taxable income was $33,127, or $637 per week, so under the HECS guidelines he was required to pay four per cent of his income-$1,352 per annum, or $25.48 per week-towards his HECS debt. In 1993-94, he would clear his entire HECS debt of $1,146. However, in May this year Mr Turner, like other HECS clients, received a letter from Mr Michael Carmody, the head of the tax office, urging him to lodge a compulsory-I stress, compulsory-employment declaration form or face tax being deducted at the marginal rate of 48.4 per cent. Mr Turner obediently did so, advising his employer that he had an accumulated HECS debt and enabling the additional tax instalments of $25.48 per week to be deducted from his pay from 1 July 1994. However, when Mr Turner went to lodge his 1993-94 tax return in September this year, he discovered that the tax office had hit him with the entire HECS debt of $1,146, but he received no credit for the additional tax rata instalments totalling some $300 which he paid between July and September. Imagine if Mr Turner had not lodged his tax return with his tax agent until the latest possible date, which is April 1995. By that stage, Mr Turner would have paid an additional $1,000 in tax instalments in the belief he was paying off his 1994 HECS debt-a classic double take! People like Mr Turner who have been caught out have since been able to lodge a section 221D-an application for variation of tax instalment deductions form-which stops their employer from taking out further tax instalments. However, this often comes too late, with the likes of Mr Turner paying some $300-it could have been $1,000 in the worse case scenario-in tax credits before realising this HECS double take which, I stress, will not be rectified until the following tax year. Unfortunately, Mr Turner's is not an isolated case. I believe that many thousands of exstudents could be affected-people who are most often struggling with mortgages and people who are educating young families. The solution is that people who believe they will clear their HECS debt in a given year should be advised by the tax office not to sign the employment declaration form or to get a special 2210 exemption form, so that the additional tax instalments are not unnecessarily taken out in the following year. It does not require a major policy change but some better and more honest advice from the tax office. It is important that people pay tax only once. I believe that those who have unfairly had their tax collected twice should receive immediate refunds. They should not have to wait until the end of the financial year for refunds. Newman, Mr John: Death",128
203,Mr GRACE,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to address my remarks tonight to a 60 Minutes program aired on Sunday, 11 September 1994, advertised as a tribute to murdered Cabramatta MLA, John Newman. As part of the media coverage, on Friday, 9 September-less than four days after John's murder-Channel 9's 60 Minutes began a heavy local advertising campaign claiming Richard Carleton would be conducting a tribute to John Newman at the Cabramatta Cabra-Vale Ex-Active Servicemen's Club. As Cabramatta is part of my electorate, I decided to attend. I must say that I had reservations about the forum from very early on, but I hoped to be proved wrong. I had a feeling it would simply be an Asian bashing, ratings grabbing exercise. I went along to the meeting with high hopes but low expectations. Unfortunately, my expectations were proved correct. From the outset, Mr Carleton belittled the police and their efforts to solve the crime. From his comments and tone, Mr Carleton clearly had preconceived ideas of who was responsible. Of course, Richard did not stop there. He pushed on, also claiming that the Asian wall of silence was preventing the police from getting the truth. Again, it was clear that Richard had made up his mind as to which group was responsible-the Asian community, of course. In the midst of all the tubthumping, there were a few voices of reason. I would like to think that mine was one of the voices, together with those of one of my parliamentary colleagues, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), and the representatives of the police force. However, the most articulate voice was clearly that of a young high school student from the local area. That young woman spoke more wisdom in a few brief sentences than a year of Richard Carleton plus his 60 Minute programs. Her thoughts, and those of a number of other young members of the communi-. ty, made me proud to be their local member. Sure, we have problems locally-perhaps more than our fair share-but seeing those young people shows that multiculturalism is certainly not one of those problems, in spite of the media treatment we get. Disregarding those positive points, Mr John Westacott, executive producer of 60 Minutes, this week sent a letter to one of my local newspapers, the Liverpool City Champion. In it, he attacks me and my attitude towards the forum. While the content of Mr Westacott's letter may well be defamatory, let me say this: if I had not known better, I would have thought that he was describing his own program. Unfortunately, it appeared that 60 Minutes was keen to give only yobbos and bigots a forum to increase racial tension-a great formula for increasing ratings but nothing more. I also found it personally offensive to be accused of being locked away safe in Canberra by someone bunkered up inside fortress upper-class Hunters Hill. As do most members, I live in my electorate. I have done so for over 30 years, and I have represented at a local as well as a federal level since 1976. I know and understand the problems of my local area better than some jumped-up joumo from Hunters Hill. Mr Westacott suggests that I pick up from where John Newman left off, but I have no intention of doing that. Let me simply say that John and I had different ideas about how to achieve for our constituents. Mr Westacott should realise that there is more than one way to achieve for your community, and that the different levels of government have different responsibilities. Of course, I realise that this is a lot to comprehend when you are blindly chasing ratings. Mr Westacott claims to have received many expressions of gratitude following his program. Mr Speaker, let me inform you that my office was inundated with positive feedback to my comments, not to mention the numerous suggestions as to what Richard Carleton should do that were both physically and anatomically-not to mention morally-impossible. If Mr Westacott truly believes that I am alone on this issue, perhaps he should have read an article by Gerard Henderson last Wednesday. I do not often agree with Henderson, but this was a good article. He said that Mr Westacott and Richard Carleton should take a long hard look at themselves and ask whether they want to make a worthwhile contribution to Australian society or whether they want to continue as a poor parody of the ABC's Frontline. National Roads and Motorists Association",129
204,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"North Sydney) (7.28 p.m.)The proposed privatisation of the NRMA is a hijack of over $2 billion of members' funds. It exceeds anything attempted by the entrepreneurs of the 1980s. If it succeeds, it will be the beginning of a massive de-mutualisation of such bodies as AMP, National Mutual, Colonial Mutual and other state motoring organisations. It will herald the change in Australia from a cooperative society to one clearly based on individual greed. There is widespread alarm in New South Wales about the behaviour of the controlling directors and the executive of the NRMA. This alarm relates to the public promotion of the sale by the executive officers who have not declared their financial interests, the misleading advertising contrary to the Trade Practices Act, the removal of the secret ballot for members, the effective intimidation of NRMA staff, interest free loans of members' money to staff, the failure of the Australian Securities Commission in relation to the prospectus, the role of the NRMA vice-president and Australian Securities Commission deputy chair, Lyn Ralph, and the failure of the NRMA to allow a no case to be put. Studies carried out by financial experts show that the NRMA proposal is convoluted and obscure, and that it certainly breaches the Corporations Law and the Trade Practices Act. It is misleading and deceptive. Analysis shows a hidden loss to NRMA members of $2,220 million, without counting increases in road services costs and potential losses to aged pensioners, sole parents, family allowances, Austudy, home child-care allowances, family allowances, family allowance supplements and pensioner card holders. An amount of $93.5 million of members' insurance rebates will disappear and members will bear the $30 million notation costs. The maintenance of a share register alone will cost $5 million annually. It is suggested that members will receive up to $2,000 for their shares, yet the truth is that no price is fixed and the NRMA board does not even have to sell shares at the best price. There is a real possibility that the share price will stagnate in a glutted market. Taxation treatment is still vague, but it is certain that the Treasury will benefit to the extent of $600 million to $700 million. All of this is hidden in the board's proposal, which pretends that the shares are free when in fact they are simply an exchange for the member's vote and assets. No additional funds are created but significant changeover costs to members are incurred. The board's prospectus talks of a favourable outcome for tax, yet the NRMA will lose its mutual exemption status, assets will attract around $50 million in capital gains tax, and $375 million of tax credits on future dividends will be lost, as well as attracting capital gains tax on the free shares. There are several potentially adverse consequences for members in receipt of social security, veterans' affairs and Austudy payments. Shares, unlike current memberships, will become income and assets tested. With an additional $2,000 income, age and veterans' affairs pensioners could lose up to $38 per fortnight. Members close to assets test cut-offs could lose the whole of their family payments or Austudy. The home childcare allowance is income tested and a franked dividend of $70, that is 1,000 shares, could have the $30 weekly allowance, and franking credit is of no value to an allowance recipient. The absence of a no case and the failure to spell out the potentially adverse tax and social security impacts in the prospectus appear to be inconsistent with fiduciary duty. The use of terms such as 'free shares' and 'favourable tax treatment' in the prospectus is misleading and deceptive and a breach of the Trade Practices Act. The validity of special resolutions terminating the membership of members and the role of NRMA Holdings as a member of the association are highly questionable. These problems and many others have been confirmed in a legal opinion by John Gamsey QC and Brian Camilleri, prepared for the minority directors of the NRMA-Jane Singleton, Dawn Fraser and Richard Talbot. The legal opinion confirms the defective and misleading nature of the prospectus and that the directors of NRMA Insurance have not adequately discharged their duties. A massive confidence trick is being perpetrated on most of the people of New South Wales, yet the Australian Securities Commission is pretending the problem does not exist. In fact, what is happening is that a small group of self-perpetuating directors, aided by a self-serving executive, is attempting to escape public judgment by cancelling the NRMA elections and trying to hoodwink or intimidate all who stand in their way. Drought Relief Package",130
205,Mr HARRY WOODS,ADJOURNMENT,"page) (7.32 p.m.)The farm drought measures released and announced today by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) certainly will provide great relief to drought-stricken farmers throughout the country areas of Australia. I welcome those measures. I have been pleased to work with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Bob Collins, and to visit areas with him and recently to visit some of the western areas of Queensland with the Prime Minister. The development of the policy is in part a result of those visits and the local knowledge gained. It will help those farmers affected by drought to hold onto their farms and to maintain a reasonable quality of life until the drought breaks. The policy changes announced today recognise that the drought we are currently facing is a severe and exceptional one and something which farmers could not have planned. I also welcome the endorsement of the policy announced today by the National Farmers Federation. The government has worked closely with the National Farmers Federation to develop a scheme which will provide immediate assistance where it is needed. It is a basic policy change but does continue the integrity of the general policy. It will provide help where it is needed when it is needed. I particularly commend the members of the National Farmers Federation for the constructive role they have played. I note that the National Farmers Federation says that the states will also have a crucial role to play in this and that it will be monitoring the effort of the states. The President of the National Farmers Federation, Mr Don MCGauchie, said that the extra measures were significant and that they would be of enormous benefit to farm families who have been suffering severe drought. 'Today's announcements are consistent with advice given to the department from farm organisations,' he said. He also said that the Prime Minister's personal visit to severely droughted areas in Queensland last week clearly had influenced the outcome. Mr MCGauchie said that Senator Collins, backed by the Prime Minister, had done a good job for the farm sector and that both of them have 'our sincere thanks'. He said that it is now up to the states to also meet their responsibilities for funding in this area and undertook that the National Farmers Federation and the member bodies will continue to work closely with the government to develop final proposals in all the areas. The new relief payment will provide farm families with sufficient cash for basic necessities and services. Payments under the drought relief package will be made available to farm families in areas assessed to be in exceptional drought and will be subject to the income and off-farm assets tests that apply to the jobsearch allowance. Farm assets will not be subject to assessment for drought relief payment. Payments under the drought relief payment will be available from mid-October, but they will be retrospective to the start of the month, which is only a couple of weeks away now. They will continue until six months after the exceptional circumstances conditions are terminated. Those families will also be eligible for family payments and health care card benefits. Under Austudy, the existing Austudy farm assets test will be removed for those families in exceptional drought areas. There will be farm business support to the measure of $74 million for the RAS over 1994-95 and 1995-96. That will be available to assist farm businesses during drought exceptional circumstances and the recovery period. The package also includes measures to help farms recover from drought. There will be a six-month period after the termination of the exceptional circumstances declaration in which applications can be made. Farmers have not been able to access the exceptional circumstance provisions of RAS without first selling off-farm assets. That has created difficulties where farmers have taken steps to provide for their retirement. In recognition this, investments in bona fide insurance and superannuation funds have been excluded from the assets test for the exceptional circumstances support and an assets test of $163,500 will apply for other off-farm assets. Also, the maximum individual annual assistance limit on RAS interest payments has been lifted from $50,000 to $100,000, while the cumulative limit over five years on assistance has been lifted from $100,000 to $500,000. There is also additional support for counselling and support services and for drought preparedness. It leaves the National Party and the opposition generally in a very poor position. I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) tonight in speaking about it said-he was still holding on to itthat he was disappointed that the coalition's proposed fodder subsidy had not been taken up by the government. Obviously he is not aware of the rorts that went on with that. For example, in Queensland in the 1980s, there was a $15 million subsidy and 76 per cent of those funds were paid to only 16 per cent of program users. (Time expired) Telecommunications",131
206,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I refer to the Australian newspaper of today, which states: A $5.5 billion joint venture formed yesterday between Optus Communications, Nine Network Australia, the Seven Network and United Statesbased Continental Cablevision has significantly accelerated the roll-out of the information superhighway. I am pleased to read that. But, if they have the information superhighway, people in my electorate have the gravel track. The ballot to choose between Telecom and Opt us is about to take place in the 054 area code, which covers the Bendigo region. Only about 80 per cent of the people in this area can access the Optus service by dialling 1 because Telecom has yet to upgrade all of the exchanges in this region. We are getting left behind. We are the gravel track. Things are not moving. We are moving at 1,000 miles an hour in information technology with the announcement today of this service, yet country areas are being neglected. Austel has advised me that of Telecom is on target to complete its exchange upgrade program by 1997. So we have to wait another three years before we can dial Optus and have the choice. Telecom recorded a profit in 1993-94-1 know that members have an interest in thisof $1.7 billion, of which the federal government's share is about $738 million. It is about time the government made some of that $738 million available to Telecom to ensure that people in areas like Bendigo and Ballarat have access to this improved service and the right to choose whether they dial through Optus or Telecom. If Telecom does not have the money in its resources out of that $1.7 billion-I have raised this with the chairman of Telecom on a number of occasions, particularly because of the standard rate charging that it has introduced into other centres for trunk calls and STD calls-to upgrade those exchanges in the Bendigo region prior to the ballot, perhaps the minister can release some of that $738 million raised to allow the exchange upgrades in country areas to proceed and enable people on the gravel tracks to participate in the information superhighway. Higher Education: Funding",132
207,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Last night, after the House adjourned and after the dinner with the Taoiseach of Ireland, I went across to the ANU because I understood that there was a student protest under way there. I visited the students and gave them an assurance that I would read a message they have to the Australian people. It reads: NA On Thursday 15th September 300 students of the ANU occupied the Chancelry Building on the ANU campus protesting against the introduction of a $5000 fee for Legal Workshop course and the proposals for upfront fees on both undergraduates and postgraduates canvassed in the DEET WORKING PARTY OPTIONS PAPER. (Flat $4000 fee for all the postgraduate courses and $1000 for undergraduates) The students have sought commitments from the Vice Chancellor to withdraw the Legal Workshop fee; publicly oppose the DEET Options Paper and to vote against proposals for up front fees in future Council meetings. The students recognise that greater efficiency can be achieved within existing University budgets, but argue that it is the current disparity between total student places and government funded positions, which has led to the targeting of students as a source of revenue. This is a direct consequence of the government's deregulation policy! The No Fees Campaign opposes deregulation and privatisation of higher education and calls on the federal government to: (1) make a commitment to the principle of free education at the forthcoming national conference. (2) reject the funding options canvassed in the DEET Working Party Options Paper; and (3) reverse its decision to deregulate postgraduate funding which has opened the way to upfront fees. The DEET Options Paper seriously misjudges the detrimental impact of fees on access to tertiary courses and the resolve of students to oppose upfront fees. Increases to funding through the imposition of upfront fees on undergraduates and/or postgraduates is not acceptable to the student body. No Fees Campaign This is the statement by the occupational headquarters of the students of the Australian National University. I am the son of an electrician. In 1969, my father was employed by Australian Iron and Steel at Port Kembla. His wages in that year were $9,000. In that year he sent my eldest sister to university and it cost him $3,000. Those were the dark days when the sons and daughters of the idiot aristocracy kept their class position in their country by access to degrees from universities. Then along came the breath of fresh air: a man by the name of Gough Whitlam. There are sons and daughters of Gough Whitlam across this land, able to get through university simply because university education was made free in this country. Mr Speaker, you know that I am an advocate of free education, as I am an advocate of free health. To the extent that the government has been responsible for this, I am sorry. I apologise on my behalf only, not on behalf of the government. I believe that it needs to make those decisions. However, the issue of the process of deregulation, which the students bring forward, has a point. If university administrations are allowed to have a deregulated base on which to charge, they will do as they have done with the ANU. I oppose it. I understand that there is logic, I understand that there are arguments along those lines and I understand that the government's position has been consistent in the logic that it has put forward, but I believe it is wrong. I believe the government is wrong, although I believe that the opposition, quite frankly, would do a hell of a lot worse. This country requires free education so that all Australian citizens can reach their potential. I will not spend my time in this House as  does. He sits at his desk and bashes student organisations because they happen to stand up for their rights. He came out of a student organisation. He is a traitor to the people out there who want free education; he is a traitor to the Australian citizens and the young Australians who require the best of them to be able to reach their potential. Mr Ronaldson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",133
208,Mr KNOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING OPTIONS,I ask that this government recognise the need for free education.,133
209,Mr SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING OPTIONS,"The honourable member for Gilmore will resume his seat. I call the honourable member for Ballarat on a point of order. Mr Ronaldson-The theatre of the adjournment debate, as you know, Mr Speaker, has never been lost on me, but I think the word 'traitor' is perhaps a comment that the honourable member might like to withdraw.",134
210,Mr SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING OPTIONS,"I was listening very carefully to the comments made by the honourable member for Gilmore, as we all were. If in this particular case the honourable member has found the word offensive, in deference to the chair I ask him to withdraw the comment.",134
211,Mr KNOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING OPTIONS,"Mr Speaker, I ask for clarification on that. Are the words 'a traitor to the student bodies' offensive?",134
212,Mr SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING OPTIONS,I think the words that you used went a bit further than that and it would assist the chair if you withdrew.,134
213,Mr KNOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING OPTIONS,"To assist you, Mr Speaker, I withdraw. (Time expired) Telecommunications Parliament: Hours of Sitting",134
214,Mr RONALDSON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING OPTIONS,"Ballarat) (7.46 p.m.)I would like to take up some matters raised by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). Indeed, we should be referring to the discontinued information superhighway. I know that the front page of the Australian and other newspapers are talking about the information superhighway, but there are still people in my electorate who do not have access to a 0055 poisons information line. I appreciate the fact that we are going down a path that I fully support, but let us put it into some sort of perspective when there are still people in this country who cannot access even the most basic of services such as that. The other matter I want to talk about tonight is one that I have raised before, that is, the hours that we are sitting in this place and their effect on a large number of Canberra men and women. Indeed, it is my understanding that the number of staff employed by the catering service at this House has been dramatically reduced. A large number of those people were students working part time, the very people that the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) has referred to tonight. There has been a significant staff loss, or cutting of hours. It is totally lost on me, when there are only two people who can get to their own home from this place-and that is the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly); I do not know whether there is anybody else who can get home",134
215,Mr REID,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING OPTIONS,The PM is pretty close.,134
216,Mr RONALDSON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING OPTIONS,He is indeed. This place rises at 8 0' clock and I cannot for the life of me understand why we are wasting what I believe is a good two hours every night of the week. The Australian community surely is paying us to work while we are here. I think we work damned hard. Mr Leo MCLeay-You wouldn't work in an iron lung.,134
217,Mr RONALDSON,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING OPTIONS,"Even you, Leo, work damned hard; I concede you that. What I am saying is that we need to put another two hours onto the hours that we are sitting. We are already talking about sitting an extra two weeks next year, from my understanding of the program that has been put out. That surely must be related to the hours that we are not sitting. I am not suggesting that we go back to the days of working until 11, 12 or 1 o'clock in the morning; that is patently ridiculous. But for us to be rising at 8 o'clock, I think, is a quite obscene waste of taxpayers' money. I think it is a dereliction of our duty to govern this country. We are away from home. People now go out to dinner, not to the staff caff or to the members dining room. We could fire a cannon through that place now. I think it is a great shame that in what was a great employing institution, the Australian parliament, which was providing jobs for young people in Canberra-not only young people but also people of all ages-the work has now diminished and we are getting away from this place at 8 o'clock at night. I think it is quite extraordinary. Surely we can sit down, as fairly rational people, and say, 'There was a bit of overkill with the hours that we were sitting before.' They were silly, and I am the first to admit that. But to go back to 8 o'clock I think is absolutely outrageous. We should be going on the adjournment debate at 10 o'clock and those who want to speak in the adjournment debate can stay until 10.30 p.m. and then go home. I think it is extraordinary. I plead with members on both sides of the fence to have a bipartisan approach to this quite extraordinary eight or 10 hours that we are wasting every sitting week. Drought Relief Package",134
218,Mr DODD,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING OPTIONS,"I commend the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) for the initiatives announced today in the drought package. The total cost of assistance will be $91.4 million this financial year and $72.8 million next year. The Austudy exemption alone is worth $3.7 million this year and $2.7 million next year. I am sure everyone in this House will welcome that package. Most of my electorate, which extends from Cairns to the Torres Strait, has been relatively unaffected by the drought that is currently ravaging much of Australia's farming country. However, around Lakeland Downs, the dry season has gone on and on. I have no doubt that the measures in this package concerning changes to RAS will be particularly welcomed in that community. The areas in my electorate that are affected by drought are remote. For example, Lakeland Downs is four to five hours drive from Cairns and two days drive from Brisbane. The graziers and farmers of Lakeland Downs are not in a position to slip into their nearest Social Security office to fill in the relevant forms access additional drought assistance because the nearest DSS office is 300 kilometres away. While they will no doubt hear about today's very good package on the ABC radio and television, they may have to wait up to a week for the mail plane to bring the daily papers and any written correspondence about this package. In this context I would like to comment on the findings of a rural outreach program conducted by the Mareeba office of the DSS in 1992. I was provided with a copy of the paper by the Mareeba DSS office after I made inquiries about the level of DSS assistance for farmers in my electorate. The internal report on the Mareeba rural outreach program makes some very pertinent observations about the perennial problem that the DSS faces in providing service to rural areas. There are a lot of matters listed. The most important is the difficulty of accessibility of the DSS to remote areas. Of the outreach modes trialled, the most successful was personal contact by DSS officers at various meetings with farming groups. Eighty-two per cent of claims received during the outreach program were made following contact with DSS officers at meetings. I believe that the findings of this local initiative are worth noting in the context of these initiatives. It is not enough to come up with the dollars. We must now make sure that all those farmers who are eligible for assistance are made aware of their entitlements. It is not just up to the DSS. Farming organisations have a key role to play. The National Farmers Federation has been full of praise for the government's package today and local farming organisations have regular contact with their members. They are in a position to make sure that their members are aware of the full range of assistance available in this package as well as the normal DSS family payments. I note that the National Farmers Federation has welcomed today's assistance package. It is now up to the NFF to get that good news out to its members. One of the most significant recommendato tions of the report of the Mareeba outreach program was that each DSS office have a rural contact person to help address the perennial problems, one of which I have listed. This person's duties could include contacting local farming groups, attending appropriate meetings, identifying when farmers are in need and mediating between farmers and other DSS staff. Some of the other problems that were raised are the complex nature of the claims process, time constraints farmers face in the day-lo-day farm operation, the difficulty clients have in comprehending the details of available resources, and the diversity of resources available to farmers, which leads to some confusion. I think the whole package is an excellent idea. I will be forwarding a copy of the report on the Mareeba outreach program to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) for his comments so that hopefully some of the good ideas in the report can be taken up by the Department of Social Security. Newman, Mr J: Death",135
219,Mr RICHARD EVANS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING OPTIONS,"Tonight I want to support the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) and make some comments about the recent killing of John Newman, a New South Wales Labor parliamentarian and campaigner against crime. There can be no doubt of the valuable contritailed bution played by Mr Newman in fighting those elements in our community who strive to line their pockets through drug dealing crime. I would like to take this opportunity to the concerns of many of Australia's Vietnaviolence. mese community, both in New South Wales and around Australia, and to caution, now for the future, media commentators, politiNewman. cians and the general community about making generalisations of a crime such as and its supposed links with one ethnic group or another. Mr Jack Waterford, in an article in the Canberra TImes, said: Murders or attempted murders of political are by no means unknown in Australia, rare though they may be. What is also not unknown is a season immediately after of the authorities failing to see them committed by individuals and of ascribing the conduct generally to particular ethnic groups. Similar sentiments were expressed in my own electorate where there is a large number of residents with Asian heritage, and more particularly from Vietnam. The vilification experienced by the Vietnastatement mese community since the assassination of John Newman has been unnecessary, even unfair. For some public commentators and authorities to refer loosely to one particular ethnic group over another further heightens the distance between newer Australians and those of us who have been here longer. It also ignores the valuable contribution played by the Vietnamese community in Australia, especially in the work it has been doing to provide a safe haven and new home for those Vietnamese escaping the persecution of the present Vietnamese regime. The Vietnamese community in Western Australia has a record of hard work and genuine commitment to enhancing the variety of ethnic backgrounds in Western Australia. It would be unfortunate, and quite wrong, if these recent events tarnished this very positive image. Those who would draw attention to one group over another need to be reminded that criminals transcend ethnic groups. I am aware of the comments of the Vietnamese community in Western Australia dein the West Australian last week. It would be appropriate for them to be on the public record. Speaking for the Vietnamese and community, Dr Van Phat Nguyen said that the Vietnamese community reiterates the concerns echo of many Australians in opposing the use of He went on to say that the Vietnamese community was unanimous in its disgust and and opposition to the killing of Mr John Dr Nguyen said that the Vietnamese comthis munity wanted to caution the community against automatically blaming members of the Vietnamese community for the incident. He added that the Vietnamese community takes figures enormous pride in the peacefulness and tolerance of Australia and is very concerned that the incident could do irreversible damage to the Australian way of life. I endorse his as crimes comments and ask the community for some tolerance while maintaining the rage against this crime. Australian Rugby League: Grand Final",136
220,Mr LEO MCLEAY,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING OPTIONS,"Watson) (7.57 p.m.)I rise tonight to condemn the outrageous that was made in the Senate today by Senator Julian MCGauran, one of the more stupid members of that chamber. Senator MCGauran today made the allegation that the New South Wales rugby league grand final, which is on on Sunday, could be rigged. He went on to ask the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, to give the Senate an assurance that the rugby league grand final is not fixed for Canterbury to win this Sunday. All of us come into this chamber from time to time and canvass support for one particular code or another or one particular team or another. I note that there are members on both sides from various states who would say that rugby league is one good game; others would say that Australian Rules is another; others would say that rugby union is one; and others would say it was soccer. We all have various clubs that we support. But for some stupid fool to stand up in this parliament and extend just a state or interclub rivalry and call question the honesty of the people who are playing the game in a grand final is really disgraceful and disgusting. Senator MCGauran, who is from Victoria, where they are normally Australian Rules supporters, might think that is a very funny thing to say to get a cheap headline on the news shows. It just shows the puerile attitude that some of these people have to what is a very successful game. I do not think that anyone from New South Wales or anyone in this chamber would be silly enough to allege that the Australian Rules grand final is fixed, purposes. because we all know it is not. We all know that rugby league grand finals are not fixed. We all know that there is a whole range of people across the community in this country who enjoy these games of a weekend. Their pleasure in the game is absolutely sullied by the approach of nitwits who want to bring the game into disrepute. Senator MCGauran suggested that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories should initiate a parliamentary investigation into allegations along the lines of the drugs in sport inquiry. I have never heard of anything so ridiculous and I think that Senator MCGauran, who seems to be just as loopy as his brother who sits in this chamber, ought to forget about cheap political shots and withdraw these allegations, because I think it is a disgraceful proposition.  order",136

However, I want to pick up the point made time to time by members opposite, suggesting Federation and all farming bodies have suggested particular version of the way in which the be met. Can I say that my experience, from conversations representatives of recent times, has been that of only one sector of the coalition's proposal-the farmers organisation, the South Australian Farmers embraced this entire package. Lest I fall into the same trap as I am accusing is not a case of saying, 'Look how much better the coalition members standing here and saying that the government is taking steps to address be made to improve the way in which the need, farmers across Australia, is addressed. One of those changes has been addressed remarks, I think he said it was 'niggardly small', coalition was seeking. In the light of that debate, that the government has so much trouble accepting does not seek a great deal. It seeks simply support is made available to farmers and to extend attached, to 12 months instead of nine months. That is not an unreasonable request, but if anything proposed by the coalition was bound difficult exercise to come to terms with because-rather of the coalition saying, 'We accept that these improve on them'; but I have a government I find that somewhat disappointing. The member for Capricornia was also very critical to the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr behind. Frankly, Mr Deputy Speaker, the problem is now four years old.

To suggest that I was sitting there primary industry at this press conference would Those who know me well enough know I am any sort of publicity. I must add that there seated alongside the shadow minister for primary by the member for Capricornia and run from that in some way the National Farmers the coalition was way off course with its desperate need facing Australian farmers should with the National Farmers Federation they are regretting their rather outspoken criticism proposal for fodder subsidy. My own Federation, has from day one endorsed and my friends opposite of having entered, this our policy is than yours.' This is a case of that there is a desperate need. We recognise that need, and we believe that changes could which is currently felt by drought stricken by the member for Richmond. In his closing meaning it was a very small change that the I simply ask: if that is the case, why is it this coalition amendment? The coalition to improve the way in which farm household the period of availability, without strings it is dismissed out of hand by the government as to be the wrong thing to do.

It is a comment that after 11 parliament I could have made, and have made Minister, Mr Hawke. I am sorry to say that about the present Prime Minister; not because in this place I have never had an opportunity to be gregarious. It is but something he never preconception that is abroad in the community Minister deals with us, rather than something foster. The changes that the coalition is seeking small changes. We believe they improve the people in drought stricken Queensland and proposing these amendments and seeking government seeking to have them dismissed out of hand, In addressing this debate the member for of the matter: which is, as he said, that only support. That tells its own story. Clearly, government intended it should do, and it extending its availability and not making it are dependent on it. We have also sought some we feel there is a certain inflexibility in making one farming family, when in many instances family and some additional support is needed the farm. I do not wish to spend much longer dealing agrees-government and opposition-that drought to expect farmers to farm in an Australian climate example, there has not been any effort by the ought currently to be intervening in the drought is the first year in which South Australia has endeavoured to be realistic about the way in that Australian farmers must expect There are, however, two difficulties.

Main Committee adjourned at 1.14 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Fire Brigades: Universal Couplings (Question No. 1379) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (I) Has (a) his Department or (b) Standards Australia been informed of a revised, positive attitude of the Australian Fire Authorities Council to the standardisation of standpipes and couplings following the NSW bush fires in January 1994 during which some interstate brigades were unable to share equipment because of the lack of universal coupling. (2) Was a Standards Australia project on standard connections for firefighting equipment which commenced in May 1990 subsequently halted; if so, will it recommence. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The Australian Fire Authorities Council has not yet confirmed its willingness to support the development of the standardisation of standpipes and couplings to either my department or to Standards Australia. (2) Standards Australia raised a project on standard connections for firefighting equipment in May 1990 with the intention of establishing a single system throughout Australia. Standards Australia has indicated to my Department that it does not have the in-house expertise to develop a standard on standpipes and couplings and is reliant on input from committee members. Consequently, if the committee members do not support the project, little headway can be made. Standards Australia would be willing to reopen the project if the major user, the Australian Fire Authorities Council indicated their willingness not only to develop such a coupling, but to implement phased transfer of all equipment such that the standard coupling could be utilised. Duty Free Goods: Children's Allowance (Question No. 1390)",181
258,Mr CAMERON,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"the Minister Representing the Minister for SmaIl Business, Customs NA and Construction, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: Are children over the age of 12 who have paid a full adult air fare and departure tax at the full adult rate entitled to half the adult allowance of duty free goods; if so (a) why and (b) will the Minister review the situation. Mr Lee-The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction has provided the following answer to the Honourable Member's question: The concessional treatment of goods accompanying travellers arriving in Australia is governed by the terms of Customs by-laws made under the Customs Tariff Act. The provisions of these by-laws allow for the concessional entry of goods to the value of $400 when imported by an adult, ie a person 18 years of age or over. Persons under the age of 18 years are regarded as children and are legally entitled to half this concession, except for alcohol and tobacco, for which no allowance is provided. These provisions relating to passenger concessions have been in place since 1987, following an inquiry by the former Industries Assistance Commission (lAC). The lAC endorsed the long standing practice of granting children half the adult passenger concessions (with the exception of alcohol and tobacco). Customs convened a meeting of relevant government departments on 14 September 1994 to discuss a potential review of the passenger concession system. The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator the Hon Chris Schacht has requested that the level of concessions for children be considered during the planned review.
