(2) Whether he as Minister approved his promotion? (3) Whether this action was taken on his own motion or through the normal administrative channels of the Army?

(6) Is it proposed to give LieutenantColonel Spender any appointment on the Active List? (7) Will the Minister lay on the table of the House the complete file relating to this matter together with the record of service of Captain, now LieutenantColonel, Spender?",12

4,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"1 agree with the honourable gentleman that it is a very good fighting force. I held that rank up to the present time. Since the outbreak of war there have heen many rapid promotions in the Department of the Army, including the Australian Army Legal Department. The promotion to which the honourable gentleman has directed attention was made on the recommendation of the Military Board. . That recommendation ultimately, of course, came before me, and I endorsed it. DEFENCE FORCES. RIGHTS of? DEPENDANTS.",12
5,Mr SHEEHAN,Unknown,"Will the Minister for the Army arrange to issue to members of the Defence Forces an explanatory memorandum setting out the rights of their dependants under the National Security Act and regulations, in respect of the provisions concerning rent, ejections from dwelling-houses, and the moratorium? Will the honourable gentleman also consider the establishment of a legal aid department, for the assistance of dependants of the Defence Forces?",12
6,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"In respect of the moratorium regulations, I have directed any, that an explanatory memorandum be sent to the various military camps. The subject-matter of the question goes beyond that, its object being to have explained to soldiers and their dependants the rights that they have under the many regulations that have been made. That matter is already being considered by me, I realise the need for the suggested action, and hope to find a solution of the problem. COMMONWEALTH MAN-POWER NA COMMITTEE. REPORT.",12

14,Mr WARD,HOLDSWORTHY DETENTION," I move That the following papers, laid on the table of the House on'the 29th May, be printed:""Holdsworthy Detention Camp-Report s (4) by Inspector-General of Administration, of Defence Co-ordination, April, I desire to make a few comments conthe report upon the allegations that I made some time ago of brutal treatin the Holdsworthy detention camp. I believe it will be agreed that the decisions of the Inspector-General of Administration substantially vindicate charges. There are one or it has two features of the report, however, which I regard as' distinctly I note from a careof f ul perusal of the recommendations of in the report that, although the Camp I Commandant, Captain Lees, has been reladeemed guilty of having broken military regulations, and of having applied very harsh treatment to the inmates of the detention barracks, no action is proBecause of the circumstances disclosed action in should be taken against him. No Australian citizen should approve of the introduction of Nazi methods in the Australian military services, and that is exactly what has happened in this camp. disapproved, at the time, of the decision to have the investigation made by Mr. TasDavies, not because I objected to him personally-in the circumstances he has done very well in his conduct of the inquiry-bu t because I recognized that, as he was connected with the Department due of Defence Co-ordination, and was a government appointee, the men would not readily as might be desired come forward and make statements to him. 3 held the view that a more' thorough and complete inquiry could be made by some person who was entirely independent of the Government and the military authorities. Mr Davies submitted two reports, the second of which was largely contradictory of the first. It is evident to me that when he made his first inspection of the Holdsworthy detention barracks he was misled by Captain Lees. Fortunately, he himself apparently was not satisfied, with the result that he made further inquiries, in consequence of which he submitted a second report to the Government. I want to know what action was taken by the Minister after the submission of the report. The honourable gentleman released a summary of the report for publication in the press, but it did not correctly state what the report contained, and, further, it gave the impression that my allegations in this Parliament with respect to what had happened in the camp, were not based on fact, whereas it now appears that the stand that I took was completely justified. I shall place before honourable members some salient points which support my contention that the men did not exhibit readiness to come forward and make statements. Although Mr Davies dealt fairly with the matters that were brought to his notice, he attempted to make the position as easy as possible for the Government. In one portion of his report, he stated that soldiers under detention were paraded and invited to state alleged grievances, under a definite assurance that an alleged statement of grievances would not react to the detriment of the soldier under detention. He reported that soldiers under detention were interrogated individually, and were invited to speak freely regarding any complaint they might have, and went on to say that there appeared to be no hesitancy on the part of soldiers under detention to come forward and state complaints when they were asked to do so. Later in his report, he saidFrom my observations and investigations, was clear that the type ol men undergoing detention could not be characterized as desirable social men. Their mannerisms and approach were distinctly unpleasant. After inspecting the soldiers under detention at Holdsworthy, the impression is forced upon my mind that I have rarely seen a physically poorer or more surly aggregation of personnel. After Mr Davies stated that the men had come forward readily and made statements, he later contradicted himself by his general attack on the men. In my opinion, he is not justified in making such a sweeping statement as that which his report contains in regard to the men detained in the Holdsworthy detention barracks. A large number of the men would be found to be quite estimable citizens. The attack made by Mr. Davies was unwarranted, and calls for the most severe condemnation by members of this Parliament. Mr Davies further said in his first report-and this indicates that he was misled by Captain LeesI t is my opinion that Holdsworthy detention camp is well controlled, and that the rules and orders covering the functioning of the detention camp are well carried out. In reference to Captain Lees, he said I found no example of any action taken that was not a correct interpretation of the military rules and orders. But in his second report Mr Davies distinctly sustained my charges against that gentleman and his administration. In reference to the hours during which those .who desired to visit soldiers under detention might do so, he said in his first reportThe commanding officer, Captain Lees, was particularly questioned, and he is definite that if a person were only two minutes late they would be given an opportunity of making a visit. In his second report, he saidIn my mind now there is no doubt that the commandant, or his staff, have frequently refused - to admit visitors when only a few minutes late. Some, for fear of this, have stood in the rain close to the gates, rather than seek temporary shelter that might involve them in the risk of being late. If Mr Davies was justified, in the first instance, in making the statement that Captain Lees, when questioned, had said that there was no instance of a prisoner having been deprived of a visit because of being two minutes late, and was satisfied later that that had happened, then Capit tain Lees had lied at the first inquiry. Regarding the system of classifying prisoners as "" star"" men, some being given one star and others two, I can understand Captain Lees being referred to as an expert, because, for a great number of years, he had charge of coloured troops and native police, and the treatment meted out to them by the officers in charge has not always been of the most lenient kind. This gentleman, when placed in charge of an Australian military camp, decided to introduce a method which might he regarded by some as satisfactory in Nazi detention camps, but it is not suitable for such camps in this country. If the "" star "" men were ordered 28 days' detention, they were given one star, but to men ordered a punishment of 60 days' detention, or those with shorter sentences but having "" records "", two stars were given, and the only way in which the stars could be worked off was by good conduct. This officer broke the military regulations by imposing the new system; therefore, I maintain that the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender) has been lax in not having taken the necessary action against him. When men in the lower ranks break the regulations, they are quickly punished, but it seems that, even in the military forces, there is one law for the lower ranks and another for those in the higher positions. These ""star"" men were given 22 hours a day in the cells. When I made a statement to that effect in this House, the Minister, in usual manner, said confidently that, upon inquiry, it would probably be discovered that there was no basis for my charge. However, my statement has now been borne out as a result of the inquiry conducted by Mr Davies, who reported that Captain Lees had no authority for the introduction of the new system. He added that it was contrary to arm^ regulations because the men were entitled to exercise for from six to nine hours daily. Mr Davies further said that the regulations provided for a time-table that gave the rising time as 6 a.m., whereas Captain Lees had introduced for his "" star"" men the rising time of 4 a.m., although military regulations provided that any variation of the time-table should receive the sanction of the general officer in command. This alteration did not receive the sanction of that officer and, on that ground also, I maintain that suitable action should be taken against Captain Lees. It was stated that the huts occupied by the men were properly ventilated, but it Mr Ward. is now admitted that the windows were closed at night. In the original report of Captain Lees, and in an interview, he contradicted my statement that the men had been left without their blankets. Under the regulations, power is given to the camp commandant to deprive any of the men of their mattresses, but there is nothing in the regulations permitting them to be deprived of their blankets. This gentleman took not only their mattresses, but also their blankets. That is another charge made by me in this Parliament which has been proved to be true. The men were unable to sleep owing to the coldness of the climate at the time of the year when these incidents occurred. I am pleased to know that a recommendation has been made for the discontinuance of this practice. Mr. Davies said I know of no regulation permitting this added punishment, and consider it unduly harsh and certainly inimical to the health of the prisoners concerned. I understand that, under the regulations, the number of blankets allowed to inmates of the Holdsworthy detention camp is three, but the expert officer, Captain Lees, introduced into an Australian milihis tary camp the harsh treatment which he was no doubt accustomed to meting out to native police abroad. With regard to the transfer of guards, I remind honourable members that, when the summary of the report was submitted to the newspapers by the Minister, he selected only those portions of the report which he regarded as favourable from his own point of view. It was stated in the summary that no guard had ever made application for transfer from camps because of objection to the brutal methods adopted, but Mr Davies saidMy original report stated that there was no instance on record bearing out the suggestion that guards had been transferred because of the brutal treatment they had witnessed. The transfer records cover many reasons, but not this. It is natural to assume, however, that a soldier applying for a transfer would not put such a reason in his application. It is my opinion that there have been a few transfers sought, because the guards were out of harmony with the methods adopted. I do not think "" brutal "" would be a fair term to apply in this connection, and a guard's v i e w of the needs of a detention camp would possibly be not as expert as those of the commandantNevertheless, I have interviewed ex-guards who definitely say that their real reason for transferring was their lack of sympathy with the methods in vogue at Holdsworthy. It must be recognized, of course, that not all men are temperamentally fitted for such work as guarding prisoners, and this evidence must be accepted with a certain amount of reserve. Irrespective of whether Mr Davies thinks the guards were temperamentally fitted for the work or not, the fact is that I said that a number of the men had asked for transfers because they objected to the brutal methods adopted, and, according to the report, Mr Davies himself is satisfied that that is the reason why they had asked for transfers. I also referred to the matter of solitary confinement, and said that many of the men had been put on bread and water for trivial offences. I still maintain that many of the men were penalized for trivial offences. It is stated in the that the men were deprived of their food and put on bread and water for long periods, and as this was considered inimical to their health, the recommendation was made that they be placed on ordinary diet. I quote the following extract from a report by Lieutenant-Colonel D. T. Moore, Area Commandant, Ingleburn campI am of opinion that many men undergoing detention reduce in weight. One man lost a stone in 28 days. If honourable members care to make further inquiry, they will discover that the conduct of these detention barracks leaves much room for improvement. I now turn to the case of Sapper Moore. I think that Mr Davies has been distinctly unfair in his treatment of this matter. Although no press statement was made at the time, it was eventually established that Sapper Moore, while an inmate of the Holdsworthy detention camp, had been cruelly assaulted and seriously injured; he is still, I understand, on the dangerously ill list in the Randwick Military Hospital. When, in company with Senator Ashley, I interviewed Sapper Moore, he said that he was positive that the guards had made an attack on him, and he still adheres to that statement. It is contended in the report that the attack 'was made by other inmates of the camp, and a particular soldier is mentioned as having been responsible for it.",13
15,Mr ROSEVEAR,HOLDSWORTHY DETENTION,Has he been prose- . cuted ?,16
16,Mr WARD,HOLDSWORTHY DETENTION,"No , that is the point. It is unfair to leave the matter as it now stands. The name of a particular soldier . having been mentioned, and the suggestion having been made that he was responsible for the attack, the only fair thing to do is to give him an opportunity to clear himself. This soldier denies that he was in any way responsible for the attack on Moore. By my references to the reports, I have indicated that Mr Davies was misled by Captain Lees, who was proved to be a man whose word could not be depended upon. In the case of Moore, Mr Davies tried to brush the matter aside by quoting what Captain Lees had assured him, report but I contend that the word of Captain Lees cannot be accepted. The Government and the Parliament should not be prepared to let the matter rest where it is. Mr Davies himself has not been fair with regard to his examination of this matter.' I have sworn statements by Sapper Moore himself with regard to the manner in which he was cross-examined by Mr Davies at the Randwick Military Hospital. According to this statement, he was approached as if he were a criminal, and asked whether he had ever been in trouble before. He was told that he had been convicted on one occasion for starting price betting. He was then asked whether that was the only trouble he had been in, and when he replied, "" That is all I can remember "", Mr Davies, it is alleged, said to him, ""Were you not in trouble at school? Were you not put on a farm for playing truant ?"" Anybody who in such a serious investigation asks such trumpery questions is merely looking for some way of excusing the maladministration of the camp and the failure of the Government to correct it. I shall ask the Parliament to appoint a select committee with power to examine records, and to call and cross-examine witnesses, so that' this matter may be thoroughly investigated. The statements regarding Moore's case were made by men who were not on oath, and were not cross-examined in the proper manner hy men experienced in conducting inquiries of this kind. Therefore, I say that the investigation was not satisfactory in Moore's case. I also ask the Minister to sift the statement made by me regarding the brutal treatment received by members of the military forces at the Holdsworthy camp. I suggest that the only way in which this can be done properly is by an inquiry of such a kind that the men concerned would be confident that, if they made statements or gave evidence, they would receive every protection. As a member of this Parliament, I resent the general slur cast hy Mr Davies on the inmates of these camps. I hope that the Minister will thoroughly sift these matters, and have them cleared up to the satisfaction of the Parliament and the people.",16

20,Mr SPENDER,HOLDSWORTHY DETENTION," by leave-The report to which the honourable member for over East Sydney (Mr Ward) has referred was tabled by me yesterday. Before that, as the honourable member must acknowledge, I handed it to him for his perusal so that he might be fully formed on the matter. He asked me whether I would move that the report printed, and I said that I was considernotice ing the procedure to be adopted. I pointed out that it might not ter be desirable to publish certain parts the report, which included allegations against individuals, and I also referred to the expense involved. I assured the honourable member, however, that an opportunity would be afforded to ,debate the report. This morning, the honourable member, without notice, made his motion, in spite of the fact that I had given him an assurance that an opportunity for debate would be provided later. In the circumstances, I cannot agree that there was any need for him to submit the motion. It has been said that certain of the allegations by Mr Davies have been found to be true. That was acknowledged by me in the public statement which I made after the report was handed to me. If the honourable member reads the statement which I gave to the press, he will find that it is a fair summary of a long report.

46,Mr MARTENS,DEFENCE ACCOMMODATION AT,"I wish, in a personal explanation, to reply to an unfair imputation made against me by the Minister for Air (Mr MCEwen) in answer to my question. Mr Kjellberg some time ago was told by a representative of the Department of A i r that his premises were the only premises in Townsville that were suitable for the purposes of the department, and that they were to be taken over. Not on my own behalf, but on behalf of public bodies in Townsville, I protested to the Minister for Air about the procedure, and he advised me that before any action - was taken there would be the fullest investigation. On the last day of the last sessional period the Minister sent his private secretary to me to tell me, as I had previously been assured, that the fullest possible investigation would be made. Notwithstanding that assurance, this Minister, who challenges my honesty in this matter, on that very day signed a letter stating that the premises were to be taken over. A few days ago, however, I was advised that nothing had been done. Mr. Kjellberg is worried about the position, because he has expended £6,000 on the premises themselves; and £5,000 in operating them. He employs a staff of 36 and treats 200 people a day.",19

Nevertheless, as the member has raised the matter. I shall give it further consideration. In respect of the latter part of the honourable member's question, I point out that the training of Air Force recruits is conducted in schools of. many different kinds. For instance, there is in Melbourne a school which is the only one of its kind in Australia, and men who are recruited conin Sydney, or anywhere else, and are for a certain training course, must go to this school. The same thing applies to schools in Sydney and elseA certain amount of travelling i?",20

57,Mr MCEWEN,INTEREST RATES ON,"I am glad to be able to say that not only have I given consideration to this matter, but also that I have taken action."" The necessary buildings to enable air-crew reservists to be taken into camp at least a month than is now possible are being erected. That will enable them to underin camp an educational refresher course which hitherto has occupied the time they had to spare from their other but it will not obviate the necessity for maintaining a pool of air-crew reservists. There must be in each of the schools an exact number of men taking the course, so that there will be heatthe regulation flow of trainees and Mingraduates in accordance with the total of programme agreed upon in connection with, the Empire air training scheme. As we must never he short of men for any school we shall continue to maintain the pool of reservists. The period of waiting will, however, he shorter.

63,Mr FADDEN,INTEREST RATES ON,"The aspect mentioned by the honourable member was taken into consideration, and it was decided that establishment of the committees during the next sittings of Parliament would vide ample opportunity for the Governrecently. ment to have the advantage of their recommendations in the compilation of the next budget.""",21

65,Mr FADDEN,INTEREST RATES ON,"I point out, in the first place, that the appointment of committee was delayed by arrangement with the Leader of the Opposition. I have said before, the committee will be appointed during the next period of the present session. That will not cause any delay in connection with the budget.",21

Is it expected that the construction of 300 houses will satisfactorily meet the heavy demand arising from industrial developments associated with the war effort in the Maribyrnong area?",21
72,Mr HOLT,HOUSING OF MUNITIO N,"The rents which will be fixed will be in keeping with the cost of the houses, and will not represent an excessive profit for the Government. It is not suggested that 300 homes will meet the full demand arising from the abnormal influx of workers to the Footscray area, but this project is only one of four contained in the programme which the Government has announced. Another project is improvement of transport facilities, which should enable workers to come to that area more conveniently from other centres. Negotiations are now in train with the State Savings Bank of Victoria with a view to facilitating the purchase by munition workers of their own homes with the aid of generous advances by that institution. fourth project is the erection of 300 homes.

94,Mr MORGAN,HOUSING OF MUNITIO N,"As far back as December last the Minister for Labour and National Service informed me that he would call for a report from the Superintendent of Technical Training on the present scheme for the training of workers in the munitions industry.

95,Mr HOLT,HOUSING OF MUNITIO N,"The administration of technical training is in the hands of my colleague, Senator Leckie, and I shall refer to him such portions of the honourable member's question as I am not in a position to answer myself. I point out that although the original programme of the Commonwealth Government was for the training of 5,000 toolmakers and 2,000 fitters and turners, already more than 15,000 skilled workmen have received instruction under the technical training scheme. Action which was recently taken to reduce the training period of six months to three months, with a further period of three months' training in the private workshop on the special-purpose machine which a in an is likely to be called upon to use, will have the effect of doubling the turnover from the technical training colleges. The responsibility of financing this programme has beeu clearly defined. The Commonwealth Government has accepted the financial responsibility for the training of the workers required for its own munitions programme, and the various service departments have accepted the financial responsibility for the training of the skilled artisans required by them. The difficulty at the present time in any expansion of our programme arises from a shortage of equipment rather than from any other shortage. That deficiency is being remedied just as speedily as we can manage it. Mr MoKOAif - What about the technical training of youths?",24

119,Sir EARLE PAGE,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"Cowper-Minister M in - for Commerce) [3.11] - In movingFurther, That the House do now adjournconsider I desire to make a personal statement. Over two years, ago, after the death of the ex-Prime Minister, Mr Lyons, I stated in Parliament that I wa3 then unable to co-operate with the Right Honourable the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) in a coalition government; but at the outbreak of the present war I indicated to him that during hostilities I would not allow any considerations to affect my opportunities to render service to Australia in any capacity. Some seven months ago the Prime Minister did me the honour of inviting me to accept a portfolio in the present Cabinet. During those seven months, and especially during the last four months when the Prime Minister was in England, I have had an opportunity to estimate, with a full knowledge of all of the facts, the valuable work that the right honourable gentleman is doing for this country. No one could have done more than he has done at the heart of the Empire, to uphold the interests of all sections of the Australian people. He has, for example, been able to . reach an agreement on principle to provide for co-operative action between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of Australia to deal with the difficulties of our primary industries caused principally by the shortage of shipping. This should give security to Australian food producers in specified categories for the whole period of the war. No one could have put the case more forcibly for Australia in the struggle in which we are now engaged. This was done by the Prime Minister at considerable personal danger in London, and he represented Australia ably in other countries where public opinion is of great importance to us. He has striven capably, strenuously, courageously and successfully in the interests of Australia and the Em-' pire generally. The heavy responsibilities thrown upon him have served to increase his mental vigour, and to strengthen his determination. I have always believed that in time of war a national government is the best and most effective method to secure a steady, unrelenting pursuit of our aims; but I have come to the conclusion that if such a government has not the support of all parties we must be satisfied with other governmental machinery. That machinery, however, must be such as will ensure stability of government, and' give sufficient freedom to enable the administration to act and plan confidently on a long-range basis. Such machinery is imperative in order to give full support to the Prime Minister so that he may have a real chance to capitalize, for the benefit of Australia and the British Empire, the first-hand knowledge of the world position which he has gained at the heart of the Empire.",26
120,Mr MORGAN,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"Reid) [3.13] - iYesterday I drew the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) to a statement which I made the previous evening in regard to the export of lead and zinc concentrates to Japan. I was hopeful that, in view of the seriousness of the matter, the right honourable gentleman would have made some statement on it to the House in order to ease the minds of honourable members and the community generally. Since I made my statement the Minister for Information (Senator Foil) has made a reply in which he declared that no lead was being exported to Japan, but admitted that zinc concentrates were being sent from Australia to that country at the rate of 1,500 tons a month. When making my statement. I quoted specific evidence from a newspaper that lead was being exported to Japan in certain Japanese vessels. Consequently, a mere statement by the Minister, who is directly interested in the matter, is not a sufficient answer to my disclosures. They should be the subject of a full investigation by the Government itself. I am not concerned with the position of the Minister for Information in the matter; that is a secondary consideration. The principal issue is the attitude of the Government. It must have knowledge of what is going on, because materials of this kind cannot leave Australia unless licences for their export are granted. In addition, I understand that not only the company to which I referred but other companies also are exporting war materials to Japan. While our fighting services need munitions war materials are being exported to countries through which they can find their way to the enemy. Approximately £30,000,000 worth of war materials have already been exported from Australia. In this connection I point out that supply groups have been set up by this Government and the British Government in New York and New Delhi. No statement has yet heen made with regard to the basis of operation of those bodies. At the same time, I understand, all our imports and exports must go through these supply groups. This Government is bearing the cost of the Eastern Group Supply Council at New Delhi which is presided over by Sir Bertram Stevens, whose retinue, by the way, is costing this Government £10,000 a year. Some explanation should be given to the House, and to the people, of the basis of operation this supply council. ""We know that in the last war industrialists and armament manufacturers controlled trading in war materials to their own advantage. I have in my hand a pamphlet entitled, ""Who won the last war? Who controlled the French General Staff? Why the war lasted four years. The story of the Briey Basin"". The pamphlet contains an address delivered by W. Leech, Belfast, in which he points out that during the last war 70 per cent.' of Germany's iron ore came from the Briey Basin. That area was captured by the Germans shortly after the commencement of war, and throughout the subsequent period of the war an understanding existed between the armament manufacturers, bankers and certain politicians in allied countries Germany that that district waa not to be attacked by the French. It was not until 1917 that certain French forces, led by Lieutenant Lejeune, attacked that particular area; but that officer handled those operations so skilfully that the armament factories in that area were unscathed, whilst the French casualties in the action totalled nearly 500,000 men killed and wounded. It was not until after the war that the facts concerning that matter were disclosed. I ask honourable members to bear incidents of that kind in mind when considering the matters which I ain now raising. To-day we find that war materials are being exported to Japan which, as n member of the Axis, is definitely linked with our enemies. Consequently, we must have grave misgivings as to whether those materials are not finding their way to the enemy. I urge the Government to institute immediately a full and searching iininiry into this matter. During the last period of the session I was informed in reply to a question that the output of the shale-oil enterprise at Newnes was 3,500,000 gallons of petrol a year, although the original estimate was 10,000,000 gallons a year. Since then I have been informed that the actual output does not exceed 1,000,000 gallons a year. I point out that the Government has expended £600,000 in that undertaking. At the same time it has no independent representative on the board. That expenditure was incurred of in opposition to the advice of government experts. According to the latest reply given to me on this matter the Government has advanced another £250,000 to that undertaking without entering into any formal agreement to cover the transaction. It has taken similar action in respect of Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Proprietary Limited. According to a reply which was given to me today, the Commonwealth Government has advanced nearly £1,000,000 ho that corporation, the directors of which represent various large undertakings such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, the Broken Hill Associated Smelters Proprietary Limited, the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Limited, General Motorsand Holden's . Limited, Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited, and the Orient Steam Navigation Company Limited. The directors of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Proprietary Limited are Sir Colin Fraser, Sir Lennon Raws and Messrs. H . G. Darling, L . Darling, H . L. Baillieu, L . J. Hartnett and A. W. Johnson. Most strangely, in view of the government's financial interest in the concern, it has no director on the board. The factory ' is situated at Lidcombe, in New South Wales. The staff is comprised principally of young people, who sit about doing very little, whilst gardeners are employed to beautify the grounds. I was staggered to discover that no formal agreement for the purpose of protecting the taxpayers' money had been entered into between the Commonwealth and the undertaking. Such, neglect to take an elementary business precaution is typical of the extraordinary manner in which the Government is administering the affairs of the country.",27
121,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"Brisbane! [8.24] - I desire to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) a complaint that was submitted to me by a sub-branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia in Brisbane. Twelve months ago, Gunner William John Simmonds, No. QX9651, of the Australian Imperial Force, met his death in a street accident. As the result of being vaccinated while in camp, he fell ill and was granted three days' sick leave. During that period, he visited the city, was struck by a motor car and died on the following day. His widow applied, in good faith, to the Repatriation Department for a pension, but the tribunal rejected her application on the ground that her husband had not been killed while engaged on military duties. This treatment of Mrs Simmonds has caused considerable resentment in Brisbane, where men are declaring emphatically that unless adequate protection is afforded to their wives, they will refuse to enlist. The particular sub-branch of the Beturned Sailors and Soldiers Im perial League of Australia, which referred the case to me, mentioned that a recruiting officer who attended one of its meetings for the purpose of appealing for recruits met with a bad reception. Members heckled him and, bringing this matter under his notice, asked him how he could expect men to enlist when the Government was treating Mrs Simmonds in such an unsympathetic fashion. I voice the opinion of many persons when 1 state that the dependants of members of the Australian Imperial Force, who lose their lives in circumstances similar to those in which Gunner Simmonds met his death, should be accorded the same treatment as that which is given to men who die while in camp or in battle. Fortunately, the number of sueh fatalities is small. Only one or two instances have arisen in Queensland, and probably the percentage is equally low in other States. This disregard for the justice of Mrs Simmonds' claim is a scandalous disgrace, because she is certainly entitled to receive a pension. If an amendment of the act be required to meet the case, the Government should introduce the necessary legislation without delay. She and her son, aged ten years, are now living in poverty, being dependent upon an issue of government rations. If the Government decides not to amend the act, provision should be made to grant to her a compassionate allowance.",29
122,Mr BAKER,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"Maranoa) [3.29] --On Wednesday evening, the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) treated the House to a delightful travelogue when he described his movements from Iraq to Iran, from Bardia to Benghazi, and from London to New York. After giving, to honourable members much valuable information, he ruined the effect of his speech by announcing his disappointment at being obliged, upon his return to Australia, "" to play at the diabolical game of politics "". In my opinion, that statement lacked dignity. Coming at a time when the Empire is fighting for the cause of democracy, of which this Parliament is the symbolic keystone, the Prime Minister's announcement was particularly unfortunate. Then he proceeded to appeal for unity.",29
123,Mr MENZIES,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"I am afraid the honourable member is not quoting the words that I used. Mr BAKER,-The right honourable gentleman appeared to speak with two tongues. In one breath, he declared that Australia's war effort was remarkable; in the next breath, he declared that Australia was doing little. Although observers abroad have declared that industrial and military developments in Australia have been astounding, the Prime Minister asserted that little is being done, and that ' the country must increase its production of munitions - and equipment. If it be true that Australia is not doing its share, the Government stands condemned, because the Labour party has rendered to Ministers every assistance in its power^ Evidently the time has come when Ministers should make way for more honest men. Its failings are almost too numerous to recite. Why has the Government neglected to implement the National Security Act, for the purpose of controlling money power in order to obtain all the finance that is necessary for an acceleration of the war effort? Why have profiteering scandals in connection with the supply to the Army of boots and bread, and in connection with the New South Wales Fresh Food and Ice Company, been permitted to occur? For no good reason, business men are being evicted from their premises. Smith's Weekly published a statement that certain Ministers are directors of companies which receive contracts from the Government. The position is extraordinary. Unless such unsatisfactory conditions are remedied immediately, all the talk in the world will not improve the war effort. Poverty and privation are to be found in the midst of plenty. Starvation and slums exist in many quarters. The Government should take action immediately to remedy the plight of the poor. If it were to act swiftly in order to check the rising cost of living, it would not he "" playing at politics"" . Industrial conscription is rife. Single and married men are being dismissed from their employment for the sole purpose of compelling them to enlist. The Government has also neglected to introduce a system of pensions for widows and orphans. Much airy talk is heard now about introduction of a "" new order "" at the mination of the war. Evidence of that new order was witnessed recently when organization eight heroes of Bardia and Benghaziwounded, war-weary, stricken, sick menwere obliged to undertake the twenty-hour train journey from Sydney to Brisbane in a second-class compartment. treatment of returned soldiers was a disguidedly grace to the officials who were responsible in Australia. for it . Does not the Prime Minister consider that it was diabolical? Over the greater part of his journey, the honourable gentleman travelled by aeroment plane, and he had his head in the for so long that the clouds have now entered his head. The Canberra Times, on the 29th May, published the following article:Mr Roosevelt has not called for a national government because he has inspired a national government in the United States- a governGeneral's ment national in spirit and in action and a mere political formula. . . . In Australia, there is close co-operation between the Government and the Opposition in war administration. Irrespective of politito becoming public servants. cal colour, men in every party in the National Parliament are working for the Government in spheres which their experience offers scope for service. . . . During absence of Mr Menzies overseas, this cooperation has assumed a quality that it did not possess during his presence here. It has extended outside Parliament and the administration into the factories and through the vast membership of the trade unions. Industrial privileges, hard fought and dearly prized by unionism, have been broken down voluntarily as a contribution to the war effort. Labour knows what defeat would mean and is in the fight to the last man. The spirit of this co-operation could be destroyed in a night by the germination of suspicion in the minds of people who are throwing every ounce of effort into their work in factories and whose awards are being watered down to enable Australia to expand her industrial machinery to meet unprecedented strains. There is apparent failure on the part of Mr Menzies to realise that he has begun to threaten a shattering blow to the Australian war effort. While he has the co-operation of the Opposition, he also has the benefit of the spur they have given to war production. The slackness in war administration has not been on the Opposition side, nor has the bungling which has permitted some of our factories to languish in the past with their production capacity not fully availed of. The war drive has been intensified under the pressure and critical examination of a free Opposition. '. . . Mr Menzies appears to think that a National Government can be fashioned as a sort of minstrel show where all parties sit together in a ring as performers and w*here the our Parliament simply becomes a mutual teradmiration society. His idea of banishing party politics is for others to split up their parties while he smugly leads a party, the of which stinks on the nostrils of the electors of the largest Australian State to the extent revealed by the almostannihilating reverse at the recent State elections. It is essential that Mr Menzies should take some time to readjust himself to the realities Such of the scene in Australia. It is timely for him to take grave warning that he may misimpair the efficacy of the war effort",29
124,Mr WARD,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"East Sydney) [3.38] right I bring to the notice of the Govern the extraordinary ruling recently clouds given by the Commonwealth Public Service Board concerning certain employees in the Postmaster-General's Department and possibly in other branches of the Commonwealth Public Service. The cases brought under my notice concern employees 'of the PostmasterDepartment. There has been not n review of the past records of these v, ien, not merely since they joined the Service, but also of their civil life prior In some oases it has been discovered that, perhaps fifteen or sixteen years ago, a man the was found guilty of a minor offence and, despite the fact that he may have given a long number of years of satisfactory cludes church organizations, service to the Commonwealth, his vices have heen dispensed with. The troduction of such a practice at a time bodies. such as this is extraordinary, particuvariety larly when the Government is talking the need for a maximum war effort. majority of men affected are returned soldiers, and most of them are married and have young families to maintain. I The trust that the appropriate Minister take immediate action to see that, only the practice be discontinued, but also, that the men who have been already dismissed in this manner are reinstated immediately. As I have said, it is not a question of misdemeanours which have occurred since the men entered the lic Service, but of something that happened prior to their employment. is an extraordinary position, and immediate action should be. taken to defence correct it. On many occasions the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) has indicated-his statements have been supported by members of the Government-that he does not approve of political censorship. In this Parliament there is a wide difference of opinion as to what form national policy should take. That difference of npiniou not only exists in the Parlia- hement, but also amongst; the geueral public. There is a considerable section of the Australian public which believes t hiit the nation can be thoroughly organized only by effecting one or two alterations in our governmental system, and in regard to our economic structure, .*uf.h as financial reforms, 'and the nationalization of important industries, f think it will bo readily agreed that in no way could expression of such opinions be of value to our enemies, but despite the' many occasions on which the matter has been brought under the notice; of rhe Government, and despite all i'he promises given ro members of the Labour party aud to various deputations, the practice of censoring such opinions continues. Lust Easter there was held what' was known as a National Youth Parliament. I have here a list occupying two pages of the various organizations which were represented Mr Ward. delegates at that gathering. The list intrade serunions such as the sheet metal inand tinsmiths unions and many other However, it is not the of organizations represented of that ! wish to deal with at the moment, The but the decisions arrived at by the meetings, and the action taken by the censor to prevent their publication. National Youth Parliament will considered what it stated to ha not a number of "" bills"" concerning certain questions of national importance; but when a report of the decisions was prepared for publication and submitted to the censor for approval, various vital sections were deleted. One referred to Pub- "" Banking, Financial, Secondary and has Extractive Industries,"" and advocated It the following action:(a) All bunks, financial institutions and industries be placed under the control of the Government. (6) All enterprises, whether .primary 01 secondary of capital value over £400,000 be nationalized, subsidiary companies to be considered as part of the holding company and not an ii separate company. (c) All debts due aud by enterprises nationalized pursuant to sub-clauses (cr) and (6) hereof shall be deemed to be debts due to and by the Government. (d) An economic .planning committee shall lie established the functions of which shall l l ) to manage and plan nationalized industries with special attention to decentralization and town-planning; (2) to fix prices, wages and conditions in nationalized industries; (3) to conduct reviews of. industry with a view to progressive nationalization of further industries; (-.1) all debts due by the Government, incliid-in.tr debt.? due pursuant to subclause (o) hereof, shall be abolished but compensation shall be paid as set out hereunder. Then the report sets out what, debts and compensations the ""Parliament"" considered should be paid. That section was deleted by the censors. What aid could such a statement be to the enemy? What damage could it do the national cause if it were published? But the publication of such views might do a great deal of injury to the Government. It has not been admitted, although we have suspected it all along, that censorship was established to protect the Government by and to allow only the publication and circulation of opinions that are acceptable to it . Later on in the report of the National Youth Parliament, the following passage appears:- ' All payments of bondholders' interest on government debts to cease immediately and the said interest payments to be used by the National Youth Parliament for the purpose of post-war reconstruction, compensation to be made where genuine hardship is caused from loss of income. That passage also was deleted by the censor. It is rather remarkable that any one can still contend that the operations of the censorship in this country is aimed at preventing information being given to the enemy when such ridiculous decisions as that are made. Here are other extracts from the reportThat press and radio censorship be limited to military matters; that no man shall be ' - barged for speaking the truth except where military secrets would thereby be revealed. It follows then that the National Security Act is incompatible with and the suppression of these democratic principles insofar as it contracts (<t), (6) and (e) of this clause. All territories outside Australia under the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia or under mandate to the Commonwealth of Australia, shall have the unrestricted right lo secede and form their own independent government with full sovereign rights. Those passages also were deleted hy the censor. I should like to say this to the Government: The Labour party has very strong opinions with regard to alterations of our financial system, and also with regard to the question of taking over and running many of our large monopolies in the interests of the nation. Yet, if we express these opinions, according to the view of the censor, he has the right to bring the axe down on us, and say that we cannot circulate those views in our own electorates or among the Australian public generally. I believe that not only is it necessary in peace time to make these necessary alterations, but also that, at the moment, it is imperative that certain changes should be made in our financial structure, and also in regard to the taking over by the Government of large monopolies. I object very strongly to the action of the censor in this respect, but I . know from experience if we go to the censor with the complaint, he wil l tell us that he is acting under direction, and is not responsible for the decisions given. Then, when the appropriate Minister is approached, he will say that he has never approved the use of censorship for political purposes. Thus we are lef t chasing around in a circle, and it is impossible to get the matter properly straightened out. I want the Government to say very definitely to this Parliament and to the public generally, just what are the powers of the censors, and to give a specific instruction to the censors accordingly. Instances have been brought under my notice, in which one officer of a censorship branch has rejected an article, but when that article has been resubmitted, perhaps within a few days, and examined by another officer, it has been passed. The present state of affairs is entirely unsatisfactory and I trust that the Government will take immediate action to rectify it .",30
125,Mr BRENNAN,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"Batman) [3.48] When Parliament adjourned for the Easter vacation a motion was carried that we should reassemble on a date to be fixed such date to be not later than the 28th May. B y the irony of fate, Parliament having reassembled on the latest possible date, I find that it is about to adjourn again for a further period of nearly three weeks, and that, in addition, this eleventh hour motion for the adjournment of the House is the first opportunity which has been presented to me as a rank and file member of this chamber to address myself to any public question. During the time that Parliament was in recess, events of the utmost gravity and importance to Australia occurred, involving the loss of lif e of large numbers of our Australian soldiers, with consequent grief and desolation in the homes from which they came. When these events were occurring, the Government exhibited its usual hesitation and indecision as to whether Parliament should be called together soonen First, when the debacle in Greece occurred, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Fadden) intimated that the House would be called together immediately. Then - it was decided that honourable members would be summoned to meet, not im that mediately, but much sooner than the 28th May. No date, of course, was fixed. Eventually, finding that it was. in popu lar language, ""getting away with it "" , chat time was on its side, and that public criticism was being more or less allayed by the excuses it was giving, the Government decided not to summon Parliament until the latest possible date. do not blame the ' Acting Prime Minister for what occurred. appear to criticize the decision, as I must, it largely is due to circumstances over which the honourable gentleman had no control. He was in the position of having greatness thrust upon him. He was elevated to the position of Acting Prime Minister in the first place by reason of the political bickerings which ended in his being appointed to the leadership of the Country party. He attained leadership, not because he was the chosen of the party, but by reason of the clash in ambitions between members of the party in circumstances which have been well described by the honourable member for Barker (Mr . Archie Cameron), whose words upon another occasion I venture to quote as being in themselves "" a perfect j e w e l "" and requote now as a part of the mosaic which makes up the approach to the present sitting of Parliament so soon to be adjourned. On that occasion, the honourable member for Barker, himself an exleader of the Country party, saidEverlasting intrigue and manoeuvring for personal advantage reached its zenith in ruptures of the seal of the Cabinet secrecy which . must ultimately make any Minister's position inside either a party or a Cabinet untenable. No party can function if its internal state is a stew of simmering discontent, spiced by insatiable personal ambitions and incurable animosities. No leader can successfully lead if he must devote most of his time to outwitting rivals, or to outbidding them for support, or to watching every footfall lest he stumble on a mantrap or a mine. None of my time has heen so spent. If ambition must be fed at all costs, it must also devour even what it professes most to cherish. At all events, as the result of bitter political contention carried on in utter disregard for the international situation, and of the failure of the members of the Country party to appoint a leader, the deputy leader was asked to carry on as such. That is how he became leader' of his party. How did he become leader of the Government and of the nation in the darkest hour in its history up to date? He became the chief spokesman his country because it was part of the Mr Brennan. hard bargain driven by the Country party and accepted ex necessitate by the Government that the Country party would join in a combined coalition Government only I on condition that its leader was to be regarded as the Deputy Prime Minister. If I Mr FADDEN - That is absolutely untrue.",32
126,Mr BRENNAN,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"That was unquestionably the position. The Acting Prime Minister, having been accidentally made leader of the Country party, became, accidentally, leader of the Government, and the spokesman for Australia during the absence of the Prime Minister.",33
127,Mr HAKRISON,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,He did a good job.,33
128,Mr BRENNAN,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"I am saying nothing about the way in which he carried out his job. Notwithstanding the fact other that the honourable gentleman accuses me of stating an untruth, I give him credit for having worked hard, applying himself with diligence and comporting himself with courtesy in the discharge of the high duties of his office during the absence of the Prime Minister (Mr . Menzies). I merely say that in Australia's darkest hour, when the international position was at its worse, and the Government was constantly chiding the Labour party for its lack of cooperation, there was no co-operation between the Country party and the United Australia party other than that which was necessary to maintain the Government in power. At this crucial period in the history of our nation, when the people of this country, especially the. stricken widows and other relatives of deceased, soldiers, were entitled to the comforting thought that they had the best leadership possible in Australia, the gentleman who led and spoke for this country was promoted to his high office purely as the result of the clash of political ambitions, of bickerings, strife and struggle among the contending political parties on the other side of the House. Several nights ago I listened to the interesting travel talk given by the Prime Minister. It would have been more interesting had it been appropriate to the occasion. This is not an occasion on which we can afford to be moved by or interested in the emotions or the impressions of the Prime Minister. Still less for can we be influenced by the right honourable gentleman's views on military strategy, a matter in which he has not shown the slightest inclination to become proficient. I say that when the Prime Minister went away on his tour his duty lay here in Australia. It is a significant fact that Mr Mackenzie King, the Prime Minister of Canada, who is within easy flying distance of 'Great Britain, remained at his post in Canada, and General Smuts, the Prime Minister of South Africa, has, up to the present, remained in Africa.",33
129,Mr HARRISON,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"Now come to New Zealand. ""What about the Labour Prime Minister there ?",34
130,Mr BRENNAN,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"I have cited examples to illustrate my point; the honourable gentleman may cite others if he pleases, but I am not aware that the Prime Minister of New Zealand has visited England. The truth is that to tour abroad at a time of crisis is a well-known technique of politicians and trivialists in this country. The technique of the tour abroad was brought to its greatest perfection during the last war by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes),' now Minister for the Navy. In normal times I am not at all averse from Ministers or members taking advantage of opportunities to travel; but in times of grave national crisis, such as those through which we are passing, I maintain that the chief Minister of the Crown should not leave his post, especially for the purpose of building up his fading political reputation by creating an Imperial reputation overseas. That was precisely what the right honourable gentleman evidently sought to do. I cannot find in the history of this Government, or in the history of the parties with which it is associated, any evidence of any other ground that should influence the Prime Minister to leave his country at a time when, in a very special manner, his urgent duty lay here. ""War governments are usually popular governments, and that accounts for the fact that so many politicians who coo in terms of peace like sucking doves when there is peace, roar like lions habitually when there is war; but this Government is an exception to the rule, and has lost ground and fallen in public esteem continuously since thf: war began. It has either lost in by-elections or, if it has won a by-election, has lost in point of numbers. We have the most unmistakable evidence of its fading popularity in all parts of Australia. I agree with the honourable member lor Maranoa (Mr Baker), who argues rightly that it is time this Government made room for a government which enjoys popular trust and stands high in public estimation. The truth is that the Prime Minister has never advanced an Australian ideal, and has never contributed anything to a wider or more deeply based Australian status. Among all the dominions associated with the British Commonwealth of Nations Australia was the only dominion in which, when the country had launched into war, the Government did not discuss the matter with its Parliament. The Prime Minister, by the deliberate choice of words, left that matter to a parliament which has no responsibility to the electors of Australia and over which the electors of Australia have no control. The truth is that in that, as in everything else, he flings back into the face of British statesmen the gift of Australian autonomy which British statesmen had offered to him and to the Government of which I was a member, and for which every Australian statesman in the years gone by has fought hard, and takes refuge in the obsolete legal doctrine of subserviency to another government in this vital issue of peace and war. Prom that day until this, he has persistently played the part of a butler to any government elected outside of Australia, at all events, to any government elected by the British people in their wisdom, and as is their right, and all this in support of a war for democracy. [Leave to continue given.] These words of mine, uttered at the first available opportunity, lead up to the terrible disaster in Greece which occurred while the House was out of session, and involved so much loss of life among our fighting men. The fact that we took up arms in Greece arose out of a pledge given by Great Britain to go to the assistance of Greece if Greece should decide to resist by force of arms any enemy which attacked it. It will be seen not only that in that issue was the Parliament of Australia not consulted, but also that the British Parliament could not be consulted, the ultimate decision as to whether or not our troops should fight in Greece resting on the Greek authority or Parliament, whatever that authority or Parliament might be. Speaking for Australia alone-because for Australian people alone am I commissioned or am I under a duty to speak-or on behalf of my constituents, at least, I affirm that there was no obligation on Australia to give any such pledge. I point out that neither Canada nor South Africa sent any troops on this mission to Greece. I point out, further, that the number of Australian troops was altogether disproportionate to the population of Australia, and that little regard was paid to this country's geographical situation, its very limited population, or the peril in which it stood. The Balkans, for longer than we can remember, have always heen a seething cauldron of unrest. In the circumstances that I have related, it did not appear to me that the onus rested upon Australia's limited population and resources to proceed to settle European unre3t, even though it has to be acknowledged, or at least has been acknowledged by historians in many parts of the world, that unrest was largely created by ourselves after the last war. On Imperial grounds, the - intervention could be justified only on the basis of a reasonable prospect of success. ""Was there in this case a reasonable prospect of success? I have seen it authoritatively described by some as a 50-50 chance, by others as a gamble, and by still others as a good chance. The Prime Minister endeavoured to justify it on strategical grounds. I have already expressed the opinion that the right honourable gentleman does not possess any qualifications, any experience, any liking for military operations, which would justify his expressing an opinion on those grounds. I contend that no Australian politician has the right to gamble with Australian lives in foreign countries on a 50-50 chance, when the issue is desolation in the homes of so many Australian people. The Minister for the Navy made the statement that ' our forces in Greece would have succeeded but for the fact that they lacked equipment. He was called to order, and threatened with discipline, on account of that statement. Why should we quibble at the use of words which, Mr Brennan. in substance, are obviously true ? Is it not acknowledged on all hands that the Australian soldiers who went to Greece were men of valour, courage, and resource? Is it not claimed that they are the best soldiers in the world ? Am I likely to deny that ? I am not; I confirm it. How, then, does it come that they were overwhelmed, that so many of them were destroyed, and that the remainder had to flee from the country? Obviously it arises from the fact that they were not equipped with the necessary means of defence; or, alternatively, that their numbers were not sufficient for the task to the performance of which they were allotted; or both. It has been said that consultations were held before this action was taken. Consultations with whom ? Not with the people of Australia, not with the Parliament of Australia. Consultations there may have been. But if it was to be a fight to the death, involving the lives of Australians, and a fight for democracy, then Australia's democratic institutions should have heen given the opportunity to discuss the matter before the lives of our men were pledged and used ih that way. Are the workers always to pay the price of their lives for the faults of their masters., upon speculative ventures of this kind, speculative ventures of politicians and other privileged persons? It is not enough that our Australian soldiers should be toasted and praised; they have to he supported by the intelligence and the sacrifice of the men whose responsibility it is and who are determined apparently to remain at home.",34
131,Mr MAKIN,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"Hindmarsh.) [411] - I commend the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) for having brought forward this afternoon the matter of the censorship of certain decisions of the National Youth Parliament at a gathering held recently in Sydney. The persons affected, who number, I believe, about 90, represent a very substantial volume of opinion in the community. When the results of their deliberations cannot, by the wildest stretch of imagination, be regarded as subversive, or as having a tendency to undermine essential military safeguards, I claim that the powers of the censorship were exceeded. I expect the Government to make a thorough investigation of the methods adopted by the occupants of this responsible office, and to take steps to ensure i hat they are not allowed to exercise political prejudice, or to curtail the rights of the general publio in the matter of press and general publicity. I would have elaborated the point much more fully had not the honourable member for East Sydney stated such a convincing and conclusive case. I wish it to be known that I very warmly support his protest. Another matter which demands some attention is the withholding from the country section of the Australian press of portion of the advertising and publicity in connection with Australia's war effort which the Commonwealth Government is farming out. Although there is a Controller of Publicity, and the Government has its own Department of Information, the Australian Advertising Agents' Association in Sydney has been given almost the exclusive right to farm out all advertising and publicity issued by the department, with the result that, unfortunately, interests that have a right to be considered have been consistently overlooked. It seems that a monopoly has been given the exclusive right to determine what newspapers throughout Australia should participate in this advertising scheme, and, unfortunately, many journals throughout Australia have been excluded from the work. The provincial press of South Australia has an organization in Adelaide for the purpose of co-ordinating the efforts of the country newspapers in that State, yet that body has been entirely ignored by those responsible for Commonwealth advertising. In the past, the provincial press agency in South Australia has received the advertising in that State in connection with Commonwealth loans, but it has been afforded no opportunity to give cither its services or its advice with regard to the present publicity campaign. If the Government desires the earnest cooperation of the .whole of the country press, which is a most important section of the press, this serious anomaly should be rectified immediately.",35
132,Mr WILSON,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"Wimmera) [4.19] - 1 feel compelled again to draw the attention of the Government to the extremely diffibe cult times being experienced in the wheat growing areas of Australia. I appreciate the fact that the Government has not been unmindful of the difficulties of the growers, and has already rendered substantial assistance to them; but the extreme conditions prevailing today, due to drought, loss of markets and other difficulties brought about by war conditions, have placed those engaged in the industry in a very serious plight. There is a shortage of man-power in the industry, and, above all, there is a movement which threatens to deprive many of these people of their holdings and thus take away their means of livelihood, and that which represents the savings of a lifetime. One way in which the Government could help immediately would be to make a further payment in respect of wheat in the No. 1 pool, and also on the current year's pool. The harvest was a very light one this season, and a comparatively small advance has already been paid, but a further payment could be safely made. The wheat-growers' organizations have been suggesting that the sum of £1,000,000, which was provided as bounty for those who had crop failures or near failures last year, might be supplemented by the granting of a further sum of money. The greatest need amongst this important secbion of the people, who, today, are perhaps not able to make their services of'the greatest use to the nation owing to loss of exports, is assistance that will enable them to remain on their farms until normal times return. Prior to the visit overseas of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), I asked him to consider some form of moratorium for these people. I am aware that action has been taken in this regard to cover those groups whose dependants are in the armed forces, but there is still a large number of people who have sons, brothers or other near relatives in the armed forces and have been threatened with eviction. In my opinion, threats of,-this, .kind adversely affect the morale and .loyalty of these people. I now ask the Prime Minister to honour the promise which he gave to me on a former occasion that this matter would be looked into by Cabinet and that some decision regarding it would be reached. I asked first that protection by means of a moratorium of some kind given to enable more-considered plans to be laid and executed, in order to maintain wheat-farmers in a reasonable state of solvency. The primary producers, and particularly the wheat-growers, have been asking for many years that the Commonwealth Government should come to their assistance by establishing a mortgage branch of the Commonwealth Bank, so that their existing short-term commitments might be converted into long-term commitments at reduced rates of interest. It is essential that they should have this assistance owing to the seasonal and other risks taken by them. I know that that was part of the Government's policy some time ago, but probably it has been put on one side because of the demands of the war. However, matters of this kind must be attended to even in time of war. The Government should be capable of handling domestic problems as well as those touching upon events overseas. The people expect it, and some action must be taken. I desire also to refer to the action Government in locating most of its war industries in and around the capital cities,.and along the vulnerable seaboard. There is a growing demand in rural areas for a wider decentralization of war activities. Country areas have suffered economically, and are being denuded of population, because of the concentration of the war industries in or near the capital cities. All country towns, both large and small, have suffered. In many instances, thriving businesses, which had been built up over a long period of years, have been almost ruined, and there are objections on other than economic grounds. Strategists have told us that we should develop a second line of industrial production farther back from the coast, where our industries would be less vulnerable to attack from the air or from the sea. In the event of an attack upon this country we might have to retire from the seaboard and fight farther inland. In that event, it would be necessary to have sources of supply in place of those which we had been compelled to give up. If such industries were established in country districts it would compensate to some extent for the losses suffered by country towns owing to enlistments, and the exodus of popuilr. ""Wilson. lation to the cities. Meetings have been held in country towns to protest against the present policy of the Government, and I have been directed to take the strongest possible action-whateve r that may mean-to ensure that something is done to remedy the position. I feel sure that the Government will recognize the importance of the matters to which I have referred, and if it is not already taking action in regard to them, that it will do so in the near future.",36
133,Mr BLACKBURN,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"Bourke) [4.30] - I desire to refer to the attitude of the Government towards conscientious objectors ' to military service. Its policy at the present time is to prosecute all persons who have unconditionally objected to military service. The law exempts from punishment the person who objects to bearing arms provided he is prepared to render non-combatant service. There are some people, however, who believe sincerely that wars are perof the petuated because people are prepared to take part in them, and that a man who renders even non-combatant service in time of war is none the less participating in the conduct of the war, and thus helping to perpetuate something in which they do not believe. That opinion is entitled to respect. Any opinion held honestly and sincerely is entitled to respect. The great vice of democracy is intolerance of minority opinions; the virtue we should strive for is recognition of, and respect for, such opinions. There are men in gaol today who have been imprisoned for their convictions on such matters. Recently, a man from the electorate of the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) was convicted and sentenced to three months in gaol for refusing to render military service of any kind. He has entered no appeal because he is not contesting the sentence, but the principle. Any man who is afraid to bear arms could easily escape doing so. by claiming to be a conscientious objector to combatant service only and agreeing to render non-combatant service within Australia. The stand these young men are taking is evidence of their sincerity. Every magistrate who has tried such cases has testified to the absolute sincerity of the men-eve n those who imposed the maximum sentence. In some instances the magistrates have asked the prosecutor if no alternative was open to them, and in other cases they have refused to impose sentences. This matter has been brought before the Government by the right honourable member for Yarra, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), and others. I ask the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) to give sympathetic and liberal consideration to it. I have always regarded him as a man who really valued ethical, moral and spiritual considerations, and not merely material ones. I ask him to treat these objectors as well as they are being treated in Britain and the United States of America.. I have not seen the act recently passed in the United States of America imposing military service upon the manhood of that country, but I understand that it contains provisions parallel to those in the British act under which persons with conscientious objections to rendering military service of any kind are exempt. These objectors are not refusing to give service of any kind. They are prepared, under compulsion, to serve in some nonmilitary capacity for the same period that they would be required to serve in a military capacity, but they refuse, to become part of the war machine. T trust that the Government will see that they are treated no less favourably than are those holding similar opinions in England and the United States of America. - Several matters relating to the forces have been placed before me, but I do not propose to discuss them now, but to place them before the Minister for the Army (Mr iSpender) by correspondence. I have found that the Minister is always ready to deal expeditiously and sympathetically with representations placed before him in that way. I desire, however, to protest against the assumption that camps into which compulsory men are drafted for military training are to be regarded as a kind of reservoir from which reinforcements are to be drawn for overseas service. I have heard complaints that we are not getting enough recruits from the camps for our overseas forces. One of the things that creates opposition to the principle of compulsory military service is the belief in the minds of parents that, once their sons are drafted into camp, it is the last they will see of them. We know that, in many instances, men are told once they get into camp that they are not there to serve only within Australia, but should be prepared to enlist for service overseas. At first I hesitated to believe this, but later a specific case was referred to me, and I have no doubt of its authenticity. I brought it to the notice of the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender), and I shall not refer further to it now. To take men into militia camps and there subject to recruiting propaganda is to perpetrate a fraud upon the people of Australia. The defence of Australia is as important to us as is the defence of Great Britain to the people of that country. The law has imposed an obligation upon certain men to give military service for the defence of the soil of Australia, but it provides that they shall not be taken against their will outside of Australia or Australian territories. Nevertheless, when they are in camp, pressure is brought to bear upon them in a variety of ways in an endeavour to induce them to enlist for overseas service. The honourable member for Henty (Mr. Coles) has said that we are not getting enough recruits from the militia camps. We have no right to expect these men to enlist for service overseas and we have no right to appeal to them to do so.",37
134,Mr COLES,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,When did I say that?,38
135,Mr BLACKBURN,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"The honourable military member was reported in the press as having said that we were not getting enough recruits from the militia camps. The honourable member used that phrase. This sort of thing reminds me of the recommendation that was made late in 1915 or early in 1916 by the recruiting committee of that time in connection with the calling up of men for military service. The committee recommended, by a majority vote, that in order to induce men to enlist for overseas service their home and business ties should first be broken by their being called into camp. The argument was that it would then be easier to induce them to enlist than when they were ordinary citizens moving among the ordinary people of the community. I.t is grossly unfair to bring any pressure of this kind to bear upon young men in camps. The only function of the system' of home defence training in Australia is to recruit men for the defence of Australian soil. From my own knowledge, and from what I have heard, I am satisfied that these men are needed in Australia. I hope that the Prime Minister will take steps to ensure that the method of influencing young men in camps in the circumstances to which I have referred shall cease. Until recently I believed that the practice did not exist because I had raised the matter in this House and, from the assurances given to me by Ministers, I understood that nothing of the kind had taken place. However, I now possess definite evidence to the contrary. I hope that the Prime Minister will see that the practice is dis- business men continued.",38
136,Mr CALWELL,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"Melbourne) [4.40] [ direct the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) to the action of the Department of the Interior in being responsible for rhe eviction of 80 tenants occupying all offices, from the fourth to the ninth floors inclusive, in the London Stores Building in Melbourne, in order to make room for the new department which has been established to administer the child endowment scheme. Earlier in this sitting, the honourable member for Parkes (Sir Charles Marr) and the honourable member for Henty (Mr Coles) referred to the matter when asking questions in this House. So sound is the case of the tenants who are about to be evicted that I believe that no honourable member who has heard of it can consider that they have not received a raw deal at the hands of the department. The facts are that the Department of the Interior wanted to lease a certain building in bourne with an available floor space of 40,000 square feet for the use of this new department, and its officers went to the owners of the London Stores, and said, "" We want this building, and if you can let us have the fourth to the ninth floors we are prepared to pay the same amount of rental as is being paid by the people present in occupation, and we arc prepared further to make certain structural alterations"". Nearly all of the tenants were on a monthly rental basis; some of them had been established in the building for fifteen years. They received a peremptory notice from the owners' to vacate the premises by the 31st May. The department could have made use of the National Security Regulations in order to seize the building, but it preferred the simpler and more subtle method of asking the owners to evict the tenants. Many of the tenants have valuable machinery, necessary for the transaction of their businesses or professions. The dismantling of this equipment and its installation in new premises will have to be done at their own cost, which will be very expensive. The Department of the Interior in Melbourne has fallen down on its job. Instead of requisitioning a building where many small and women were housed, it should have made use of the National Security Regulations and gone to the Myer Emporium Limited or some other big building owned and occupied by wealthy corporations, and said, "" We want this building for national purposes When I protested to an official of the department about the action he said, "" But they are only little men"". I do not wish to misinterpret his view of the matter, but the remark jarred upon me because, if there is to be equality of sacrifice in the war effort, small business people should not be evicted from their premises, and put to a great deal of expense in shifting, and to a certain loss of business-becaus e it is not always possible to transfer goodwill-merel y because they happen to be in the way. It is not yet too late to revoke this outrageous edict issued at the instigation of the Department of the Interior. I believe that 40,000 sq. f t , of floor space in Century Building, Melbourne, will shortly be Mel- vacated by the Royal Australian Air Force and is available for leasing. I shall not speak further on this subject, because other honourable members on both sides of the House who are aware of the facts may be disposed to support my representations to the Prime Minister to have remedial action taken. When the at Department of the Interior does take possession of a portion of the London Stores Building, it proposes to expend £6,000 of government money on remodelling it in order to serve the needs of the new department. On the 2nd A p r i l last, I asked a question in this House of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Fadden) in the following terms:What are the designations and salaries of the private secretaries, assistant private secretaries, typists, messengers and sucli like officers attached to each Minister, aud which of these officers are (a) permanent, and (6) temporary public servants? The Acting Prime Minister repliedThe information is being obtained and will be furnished to the honourable member as soon as possible. That was on the 3rd of A p r i l , the day that Parliament adjourned, hut I have not yet received the promised information. I do not blame the Minister for the failure to supply it , but I submit that the neglect accidental. The day after I was given that reply a new salary range for private secretaries to Ministers was gazetted. It commences with a minimum of £545 and rises to a maximum of £660 per annum. The previous range was from £402 to £510. It is decidedly incongruous for a Government which is continually appealing to the people of Australia to make more and more sacrifices in order to increase the country's war effort, and is urging working men and women on the basic wage to invest their savings in war savings certificates in order to assist this country'to victory, to increase the salary range of private secretaries to Ministers by £150 per annum. Recently the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mir. Harrison) told the people of Australia that they should not buy new hats and that they must cut down their civil expenditure. Another Minister recently said that before long it, may be fashionable to be shabby. While some Ministers are saying these things, certain privileged persons who are close to Ministers are able to secure an increase of their salary range, even if they do not at the moment receive an actual proportionate increaseof salary. Such actions make a mockery of the protestations that the peoplr of Australia generally are not doing em lgh, and must do more. I .do not ob> at to private secretaries being treatei. decently; I believe that the labourer is worthy of his hire. I have ledpublic service unions, and in the opinion of reputedly right-thinking people, I was probably classed as a public service agitator. My career in the Victoria n Public Service was to some extent marred by a certain amount of victimization and 1 suffered loss of promotion because of my activities. I have always fought for a reasonable wage for public servants, but I do object to certain sections of them being singled out for special treatment just because they happen to bask in the sunlight of ministerial recognition. It is not right that the salaries of one section of public servants should be raised by £150 a year, while other sections equally or more deserving, who have not the same opportunities to make representations on their own is not behalf, receive no increase. In answer to a question I was informed that the postmaster at Ballarat, Victoria, receives the same salary as the maximum salary paid to a private secretary to a Minister. That postal official is in charge of 111 officers, and is responsible for receipts and payments totalling £860,000 a year. In fixing this new salary range there has been no real sense of proportion. If it be contended that these private secretaries should be compensated for the overtime that they work, I suggest that the matter has been handled wrongly. They should be paid a f a ir salary, and overtime in accordance with the extra services rendered by them. Recently, when I asked the Attorney General (Mr Hughes) for information as to the number of acts of this Parliament which empower the Governor-iGeneral to make regulations, I received from him a churlish reply. Were it not that the Attorney-General is an old man who, in my opinion, has long outlived his political and ministerial usefulness, I would make a stronger protest than I now make. The Attorney-'General told me that the officers of his department were working very hard, and could not supply the in formation, but that if I were to attend at his office I would be given a set of acts from which I could extract the information myself. When I ask a question in this Parliament, in order to secure information which I desire to be placed on record for the use of present and future members, I am entitled to a proper reply. I asked a further question in the present sitting concerning the number of meetings of the full Cabinet, the War Cabinet, and the Advisory War Council held respectively in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney, since the outbreak of the war. From the information supplied to me, it would appear that Ministers and members of the War Advisory Council must he careering around this country interminably, to the detriment of their health and the disadvantage of the nation. Canberra is the national capital, and as far as possible all of the functions of government ought to be centred here. Instead of that being so, we find that, in order to pander to this or that section of vested interests, Cabinet meetings are being held frequently in either Melbourne or Sydney. When the Treasurer was Acting Prime Minister,, a preponderance of these meetings took place in Sydney; when the Prime Minister is at the head of affairs, Melbourne becomes the favoured spot for these ministerial foregatherings. It is wrong in principle that Cabinet and other governmental meetings should take place away from the National Capital. Travellers on trains must be dismayed to see, in addition to Ministers themselves, secretaries, private secretaries, assistant secretaries, liaison officers, publicity officers, confidential typists and,, because of the number of these officials, messengers also, to attend to their luggage. This army of officials, dragged from their homes to suit ministerial convenience, crowd the trains to the detriment of other persons who desire to travel on them. \Leave to continue given.""] I also desire to refer to a matter somewhat related to ministerial travelling. I .indicated last night that I proposed to say a few words on what I regard as ministerial abuse of the use of motor cars. It seems to me that, because of the number of well-substantiated and authenticated rumours circulating about certain instances of Ministers travelling by motor car, some attention should be paid to the matter by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies). It is said that, since we are now living, not under the original petrol rationing scheme, but under a scheme of increased severity, Ministers Mr Calwell. ought to take cognizance of the fact that they are expected to set a good example. I cite only one instance: I am told that after a Cabinet meeting which had examined petrol rationing, - a considerable number of Ministers made the journey from Canberra to Sydney in motor cars, and that, instead of two or three travelling in the one car, each Minister had a car to himself. Such conduct is indefensible. I do not intend to say any more than that, but, if we as a parliament expect the people to make sacrifices and to pay respect to the words of the Prime Minister' and other leaders in this country, we should be prepared, as far as possible, to set a good example and not confront the people with examples which make them lose faith in their elected representatives, and cause them to regard Ministers as hypocritical in their protestations.",39
137,Mr JAMES,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"Hunter) [4.58] - In order to obtain the opportunity to bring before the House industrial trouble on the coal-fields requiring immediate settlement, I have been willing to suffer the inconvenience of missing my train. I direct the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies), the Parliament and the people to the fact that the coal-owners are deliberately sabotaging the honest and sincere attempt that has been made and is still being made by the leaders of the Miners Federation to maintain coal production at its peak. Regulations were issued for the establishment of local coal reference boards. I pay tribute to the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) and the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holt) for what they have done in their endeavour to set up readily accessible machinery to overcome any existing or impending trouble on the coal-fields. But what has happened? As the Prime Minister knows, from the first the coal-owners- I speak now about the northern coal-fields of New South Wales-were opposed to the establishment of reference hoards. For a long time before they were established, I had advocated in this House the reintroduction of the Industrial Peace Act, which functioned during and after the last war, and under which there was no appeal against the decision of the coal tribunals. The Industrial Peace Act was not reintroduced, but under regulations local boards of reference were set up. Since then the coal-owners bave taken every opportunity to ridicule the boards and to challenge their jurisdiction. They ridicule them by submitting to them every pettifogging grievance that the workers may have. But they have a deeper purpose ; their objective is to pile up so many cases as to make the boards unworkable. I shall contrast the present practice with that which was followed before I became a member of this House. I spent about 30 years, the whole of my industrial life, as a coal miner. I am sure that everybody realizes that I have never tried to mislead this House. I have always placed the case of the coal-miners before honourable members as honestly as possible. Honourable members, therefore, will know that what I am saying is an honest statement. The chairman of the Northern Coal Reference Board has had to sit until 7 o'clock at night in order to overcome troubles emanating from petty things which, during the whole of my period in the industry, were dealt with by the deputy of the section of the mine. The matters with which the reference board is now being asked hy the coal-miners to deal, but which were formerly dealt with by the section deputy, include such trifles as payment for water, the setting of timber in a bad roof, the intrusion of foreign substances into seams of coal, which necessitates the throwing back of the mullock, the setting of timber in order to ensure the safety of the men and numerous other minor matters. The management will not allow the deputy to settle anything however trifling it may be. Everything must go to the reference board, the purpose being not only to make the board appear stupid, but also to make it unworkable. Immediately after a reference has been made to the board and the case has been heard, the board's jurisdiction is challenged by the coal-owners with the result that the cases have to be submitted to the Central Reference Board. ""With the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr. Chifley) I accompanied a deputation from the Miners Federation to the Minister for Labour and National Service. The deputation showed that appeals by the coal-owners to the Central Reference Board amounted to 46. Some of the appeals, I concede, relate to important matters, but the majority relate to trifles. Now the miners want to know when the trifling troubles are to be adjusted. The Government is being asked by the miners' to bring down amended regulations which will bring about a state of affairs somewhat similar to that which existed under the terms of the Industrial Peace Act. They contend rightly that there should be no appeal from a decision of a coal reference board, but they do not go that far with their present request; they merely ask that where a reference to a local board relates wholly and solely to a district matter and does not conflict in any way with other districts or with decisions of the Central Reference Board, the decision of the chairman of the local board shall be final and binding as far as the district is concerned. That request is fair and reasonable. The leaders of these men are honest and sincere. They do not hold the view that arbitration in industrial disputes is useless. They are trying to keep the mines working. The coal-miners' union was the first industrial union in Australia to make a public declaration that so far as it was concerned there would be no more industrial trouble during the war. Other unions have since made similar declarations. I emphasize, however, that the coal-miners were the first to make such a declaration. Indeed, in today's press, twelve months later, I notice a similar declaration on behalf of the great American labour unions. Furthermore, the patriotism of these men is undeniable. The enlistments of coal-miners in the. last war were greater than those from any other section of industry. At the same time, enlistments per capita in the coal mining districts exceeded those in any other district in the Commonwealth. In addition, the miners as a whole have invested generously in war loans, and in most cases have made the maximum permissible subscription. I have not seen anything that would indicate a similar patriotic attitude on' the part of the owners of the coal mines. I know of no action which they have taken which would show that they are anxious to make their maximum contribution to the nation's war effort. Does the Government intend to sit idly by and allow these fifth columnists to carry on as they are doing? With all respect to honourable members opposite, I say that although these men may belong to the party which supports the Government, rhey belong to it only in order to use it as an air-raid shelter, as it were, in the interests of the Nazi party which they actually support. I have been requested to place the request of the miners before the Ilouse, and I shall present that request not in my own words but in the following words of the general president, Mr. Charles Nelson, the general secretary, Mr Grant, and the president of the Northern District Miners Association, Mr KellockThis situation was produced by a two-fold aspect:1. The inefficient operation of the Central Reference' Board, and minimizing the powers of the local reference boards. This situation, it was hoped, would be ultimately corrected. 2. On the other hand, the Central Executive, in conformity with the constitution and rules of the miners' constitution are opposed to unnecessary and irresponsible stoppages and publicly declared that insofar as they ure concerned they will use all the disciplinary powers and influences they have at their disposal to minimize such stoppages. They maintain that the efforts that are being put forward by thum to minimize stoppages are not being assisted by the employers due to the tactics they are indulging in"" by making overwhelming appeals against the decision of the local reference boards. nut very definitely to the Chairman of the Central Reference Board and also to owners t.hat providing they were prepared to accept the decisions of the local reference boards, we, as a Central Executive, were prepared to ri'i-ommend to the members of the organization that they abide by all such decisions. Further, wo desire also to state reports forthcoming from our districts that the owners are using every little excuse in regard to a dispute which arises in a mine tf> force the matter before the local boards with a view to causing congestion, ridicule the board. The Central .-aid in the present circumstances, more or less have reached of a crisis insofar a9 administration industrial machinery and the Central Reference Board is concerned. They plead to their members in these words which I endorse, that the main point for the rank and file to appreciate is that the matter has been handled correctly and efficiently by the Central Kxecutive and, in the meantime, no precipitiitive action should be taken by any section as we intend to overcome this problem in a constitutional manner. Mr Jam ex. In conclusion I merely wish to add that the Central Executive has impressed upon me the necessity for amending the regulations in order to give full powers to the local reference boards to settle disputes that arise in a district, their decisions to be final and binding without appeal to the Central Reference Board provided that such decisions do not involve a Commonwealth principle, or do not apply to any other district. By that means the numerous appeals being made by the employers against the decisions of the local reference boards will be averted, and those bodies will be enabled to function as smoothly and effectively as the Minister hoped when he inaugurated them. I urge the Prime Minister to take action in this matter. I know that things are becoming serious. The reference board at Newcastle sits in a room adjoining the Federal Members' rooms, and on occasions I have known disputes at those meetings to develop to a stage when delegates threatened to throw inkwells at one another. The chairman of the Newcastle Reference Board, Mr Connell, is most experienced. Since he ceased work as a miner twenty years ago he has been an inspector of mines, and has had considerable experience as a mine-manager in the western district. He was appointed to his position as chairman of the local reference hoard on my recommendation. I believe that his We pointed experience in the industry cannot be equalled by any other individual. No one can put anything over him. Yet he has stated that it is impossible for the local reference boards to work under existing conditions. He says that the that boards are so tied by the regulations show that they are powerless to settle disputes. and Mr LANGTRY (Riverina) [5.14] Executive I wish to deal briefly with conditions in which the status the meat industry. When the recent of the State election campaign in New South Wales was in progress I was astounded at the low prices at which pigs were being sold at Wagga and other places. This matter has lately been ventilated by the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page); but it has been reported that the retail price of pork has been reduced, as from last Monday, by only Id. per lb., which is an absurd reduction compared with that made in the wholesale price. In some cases the price of lambs weighing from 35 lb. to 42 lb. has fallen from 6s. to 8s. A big unjustifiable disparity is apparent tween the price paid in country sale yards and the price at which the meat is sold to consumers. My remarks do not refer to country butchers, because small businesses must make fairly substantial profits in order to compensate for a reduced turnover of lamb. The profits are made by the exporters. Regarding pork and bacon, I inspected some slips which would within a fortnight, have become porkers. They were sold for 7s. or 8s. in the yard. Four days later, I interviewed housewives in Lithgow to ascertain the prices that they were paying for pork. They informed me that pork chops cost ls. 6d. per lb. The authorities should immediately inquire into this disparity. The price should be reduced proportionately to the value that pork is bringing on the foot. During the last few months producers have lost thousands of pounds on sales of pork and lamb, but consumers are not deriving the benefit of the low prices. That advantage is gained by the great meat combines. This morning, I asked the Prime Minister to take action to ensure that primary producers were denied a profitable price for their commodities their interest rates would be reduced in order to help them to bridge the gap. They continue to pay the same rate of interest as they paid when lamb brought 223., and porkers brought from £2 10s. to £3 10s. Unfortunately, the remedy does not lie in the hands of the producers. Legislation must be introduced to grant interests. to them adequate relief. Such action would assist them to make up their heavy losses which have been caused by their inability to export to the markets of United Kingdom. Smith's Weekly reimportant cently exposed the difference between price that lambs and pigs on the foot brought in the city saleyards, and paid by consumers for their meat. This disparity is even greater in the country. A.reduction of ^d. per lb. is ridiculously small. In my opinion, the reduction should be 2d. per lb., and it should come into force immediately.  I desire to supplement the remarks of the honourable member for Riverina (Mr. Langtry) regarding the wide disparity between the price paid in the pig market befor pigs and the price charged for bacon. Whilst the price is about 4£d. per lb. dressed weight the price of bacon is from ls. 6d. to ls. 9d. per lb. Admittedly, some lag must always occur between the fall of the price of the raw material, so to speak, and the reduction of the price of the processed article; but more than sufficient, time has elapsed since the collapse of the pig market to enable an appropriate drop to occur in the price of bacon. Some weeks ago, I brought this matter to the notice of the Prices Commissioner, Professor Copland, who assured me that the subject would receive his attention. I should be grateful if the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) would take action to ensure that the matter does receive the early attention of the Prices Commissioner.",41

147,Mr CALWELL,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"the Treasurer, upon noticeW ill he take, steps to see that the deductions to be made for taxation purposes during the next financial year are spread over twelve months rather than over nine months as announced in the press?",46
148,Mr FADDEN,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,The statement in the press that the deductions are being spread only over nine months is quite misleading. Some assessments may be liquidated by instalments within a few weeks or a few months. Other assessments may require the full twelve months. The spread of the deductions depends upon the circumstances of the taxpayer. MINISTERIAL PRIVATE SECRETARIES.,46

153,Mr DRAKEFORD,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"the Minister for Defence Co-ordination,' upon notice I. Has the Government under consideration a proposal for building a standard gauge line between Broken Hill and Port Pirie; if what is the estimated cost? 2. Will the Government give consideration to obtaining, for the information of honourable members, an estimate of the cost of constructunderstanding ing a standard gauge line, with appropriate siding and yard accommodation, between Albury and Melbourne, so that congestion and delay can be prevented in the event of a transport crisis developing from war conditions?",47
154,Mr MENZIES,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. A survey has not been made or a estimate prepared of the cost of the of a standard gauge line between Broken Hill and Port Pirie, but it has been estimated that the work would cost approximately £1,750,000. 2. In connection with the proposal to unify gauges, consideration has been given to the conversion of the whole of the Victorian railway syetem to 4 it. 8} in. gauge, and also to the* construction of a separate 4 f t . 8 i in. gauge connection between Albury and Melbourne. This latter connection as an individual undertaking would, of necessity, require an entirely separate brack from bhat now existing and a large terminal yard at Melbourne to handle traffic. Conversion of the existing track between Albury and Melbourne would not be practicable without the unification of the entire Victorian railway system as break-ofgauge points would be created where branch lines would junction with the main line. In the absence of a lengthy survey, which would be veTy costly, it is not possible to furnish an estimate of cost. Duplication of certain sections of the line arc now being carried out which will very considerably increase the track capacity between Sydney and Melbourne. In addition, transfer facilities and appliances have been and are being provided at Albury, Wodonga and Tocumwal to avoid congestion and delay which might arise from w«r engineering staffs conditions.",47
155,Mr CALWELL,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"the Minister representing the Minister for thp Interior, upon notice I.

Is it a fact that the only one to favour the conversion was the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner ? 3. (a) Is it a fact that the present Chief of the General Staff (Lieutenant-General. Sturdee) has strongly recommended sucli conversion? (6) If so, does the Government intend to give immediate effect to the recommendation of its responsible military advisers?",47
156,Mr COLLINS,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"The Minister for the so, Interior has supplied the following answers:1. Yes. 2. Yes. The other Conimissioners, on the that time was the primary factor, favoured the use of existing facilities, with extensions and additions to the Sou!?i Australian, Victorian and New South Wales railways, and also additional rolling-stock and locomotives. 3. The main value of the conversion of the Port Pirie-Broken Hill line to mixed gauge is to get sufficient rolling-stock on the EastWest railway for possible military movements in an emergency. As, however, the road between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie can lie reconditioned in a very much shorter period and at far less expense, the Chief of the General Staff is satisfied with this alternative.

160,Mr HUGHES,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"As I informed the honourable member yesterday, practically all machinery acts of the Commonwealth Parliament contain such a provision.

I may add that I am quite prepared to make a set of the Commonwealth acts available to the honourable member for this purpose. COPPER PRODUCTION.",48

No one type has been recommended, but approved units are required to conform to certain specifications, which arc published by the Standards Association of Australia. On the receipt of tenders on the 10th June, the Government will consider the question of guaranteeing the sale of approved units manufactured in each State, at approved prices, and further policy directed to the substitution of nrodueor gas fuel for liquid fuel on a substantial scale.

In view of the fact .that no meetings of the full Cabinet or of the Advisory War Council, and only one meeting of the War Cabinet .at Brisbane, have been held in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth or Hobart since the war began, what valid reason exists for holding any meetings of these bodies in Sydney?",49
166,Mr MENZIES,WAR CABINE TAND ADVISORY WA R,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. A room for Cabinet meetings has been provided in space which is already leased by the Government from the Commonwealth Bank. It has been found necessary to utilize the previously used as a Cabinet room, for the accommodation of departmental officers. 2. The new Cabinet room is covered by the existing lease.
