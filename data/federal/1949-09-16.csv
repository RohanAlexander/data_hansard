0,NA,Unknown,"the dollar position. All I ean say is that it was a most unsatisfactory explanation, if it can be called an explanation. It was ful l of generalities, but almost completely devoid of factual information. There was a reference to what he termed ""hot money"".",19
1,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,19
2,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"Corio-Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [11.33] - First , I draw attention to the terms upon which t'he lionorable member for Eeid (Mr Lang) has based his motionTlie need to call to the har of this House the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank for examination regarding the international monetary position, with particular reference to the dollar crisis, Australia's international reserves, the price of gold, and international exchange problems generally. I should have thought that the honourable member would be the last gentleman to draw attention to the previous occasion on which the chief officer of the Commonwealth Bank was called before this Parliament, because that subject is linked with the depression period, in which the honourable member himself played no small part. If honourable members will refer to Hansard for the period from the 23rd April to the 4th June, 1931, they will find in it the statements that were made by Sir Robert Gibson, who was then Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board. It was following upon the evidence that was given by Sir Robert Gibson before the Senate that certain legislation, which later became known as the Premiers plan, was introduced. Every honourable member knows the effects of the Premiers plan upon the people of Australia, particularly the workers. The honourable member for Reid himself was in the chair at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers at which the Premiers plan was agreed to. I read from page 5 of the report of the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held at Melbourne from the 25th May to the l l t h June, 1931, just to prove beyond any doubt that the honourable gentleman himself was responsible for the Premiers plan and put the motion in regard to it. I am reading this extract",19
3,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,What has that to do with the matter?,19
4,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"It has this to do with it, that the honourable member for Reid has suggested that the chief officer of the Commonwealth Bank should be brought before the bar of this House to give certain evidence. I am directing attention to the fact that when the chief officer of the Commonwealth Bank, the late Sir Robert Gibson, was on a previous occasion brought before the bar of the Senate to give evidence, the consequence was that a plan was inaugurated to the great disadvantage of the workers of this country.",19
5,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,That has nothing to do with the matter.,19
6,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,It has a great deal to do with it. The report reads,19
7,Mr LANG,Unknown,"You were objecting to the flatrate imposition there, and now you want to say that we ought to have the flat-rate here. As acting chairman, I shall put Mr Hogan's motion in the form in which it has been amended as we have proceeded. It isThat, for the guidance of the Legal Sub-Committee, the Conference is of opinion that there should be a reduction of 20 per cent, in all adjustable Government expenditure as compared with the year ending the 30th June, 1930, including all emoluments, wages, salaries, and pensions paid by the Governments, whether fixed by statute or otherwise, such reductions to be equitably effected. Motion agreed to. So the honourable member for Reid, who was senior Premier in the Commonwealth, was responsible for the introduction of the Premiers plan, which brought untold hardship and misery to the workers of this country, and the plan was a consequence of calling before the Parliament of Australia the then chief officer of the Commonwealth Bank.",19
8,Mr LANG,Unknown,What the Minister says is not true.,19
9,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,Look at the records.,19
10,Mr HOLTJ,Unknown,That has nothing to do with the issue.,19
11,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"There is a great difference between the circumstances in which Sir Robert Gibson was called before the bar of the Senate and the circumstances today. At that time, it is true, the financial policy of Australia was dominated by the Commonwealth Bank Board, of which Sir Robert Gibson was chairman, and it is also true that at that time the Australian Parliament had no say whatsoever in the financial policy of Australia. So there was some excuse for calling the then chief officer of the Commonwealth Bank before the Parliament, because it was he and the other appointees to the Commonwealth Bank Board, the representatives of vested interests, who were appointed by honourable gentleman opposite when they were the Government, that decided the financial policy of Australia at that time. It was because of that policy that we were led into the depression. The circumstances today are entirely different. There is no reason whatever for calling the chief officer of the Commonwealth Bank before the Parliament today, because, as a result of the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, which was passed by the Parliament, the Commonwealth Bank Board was abolished, and the financial policy of Australia is decided by the government of the day, which is elected by the people of Australia and is responsible to the Parliament and the people. So there is a great difference between the circumstances when Sir Robert Gibson appeared before the bar of the Senate and the circumstances today. The honourable member for Reid suggests that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank should be brought before the bar of - this House, although the circumstances have entirely altered, and altered for the better, in that the Government, not the erstwhile Commonwealth Bank Board is responsible for financial policy. If Opposition members had their way, they would bring back the Commonwealth Bank Board. Then it would be necessary to get a full explanation of the financial position by bringing before the bar of the House the Chairman of the new Commonwealth Bank Board. Opposition members have made that perfectly clear, because, concluding his second-reading speech on the Commonwealth Bank Bill 1945, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) said. . . on behalf of my colleagues, and myself, I desire to make quite clear to the House and to the people that when we on this side of the chamber are returned to office, we shall take prompt steps to restore board control to the Commonwealth Bank . . . Mr Dedman. make that statement publicly, here and now, because it will be well that when the people of Australia come to pass judgment upon this matter, they should know exactly what is the issue, and where we all stand upon it . There is no need whatever to call any officer of the Commonwealth Bank, the Governor or any other officer, before the bar of the House to explain the financial situation today.",19
12,Mr LANG,Unknown,Why not ?,20
13,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"Because it is the Government of Australia, and the Cabinet elected by the Labour party, that decides the financial policy of the country and how it shall be applied. Having dealt with the previous occasion on which an official of the Commonwealth Bank was called before the Parliament, which had certain consequences that, in ray opinion, led us into a bad position",20
14,Mr LANG,Unknown,"The Premiers plan was inspired by the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin).",20
15,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,The honourable member for Reid was chairman of the conference when the resolution was passed.,20
16,Mr LANG,Unknown,Nothin g of the sort!,20
17,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"Havin g dealt with that matter, I now pass to the dollar situation, which also was mentioned by the honourable member for Reid. The dollar situation is quite easy to understand if one takes the trouble to understand it. The plain fact is that Australia earns dollars by the export of goods to the United States of America and other dollar countries. It earns each year from the sale of goods, including gold, which also was mentioned by the honourable member for Reid, an average of £50,000,000 in Australian currency, but when it comes to spending dollars on the goods that Australia requires, the country needs about £70,000,000 worth of dollars in Australian currency. The difference between what we earn and what we spend in the dollar areas has tb he made up by drawing on the sterling area reserve of dollars and gold. That is a simple fact. I indicated in a previous debate that last year we had to draw from the sterling area reserve of dollars 174,000,000 dollars and that this year we shall have to draw I 72,000,000 dollars.",20
18,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,B y how much did we build up the sterling area reserve of dollars?,21
19,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"The sterling area reserve is being depleted all the time. I recently gave the figures showing the extent to which it is being depleted. It fell from 500,000,000 dollars in the first quarter of this year to 406,000,000 dollars in the second quarter, and, while the economic conference was sitting in London, it fell to 385,000,000 dollars. The drain has continued since then, but I am not at liberty to divulge the latest figures.",21
20,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,"Are only direct credits taken into account in that reserve, or are indirect credits taken into account? Is any consideration given to indirect credits ?",21
21,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,Every factor that we are entitled to consider is taken into account.,21
22,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,Who gives the entitlement?,21
23,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"If the right honourable gentleman can suggest any single item that has been neglected in making up the balance between Australia and the dollar area or the sterling area, I should like to know it. It is useless to talk generalities about some item having been missed.",21
24,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,We do not know position today and the Minister does not know it.,21
25,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"The position is quite clear. We get credit in dollars for all the goods that we sell to the dollar area and the gold that we sell to the United Kingdom. The total credit for the whole of our sales to the dollar area and the sales of gold amounts to about £50,000,000 a year in Australian currency, but we require about £70,000,000 a year in Australian currency to buy the things that we need from the dollar area. We are in the position of having to go to the United Kingdom, which manages the sterling area reserve of dollars, and say, ""We require a few more dollars than we earn. Will you give them to us ? "" So far we have been given all we require, although not so much as we should",21
26,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"We are entitled to it, surely when Great Britain owes £450^000,000.",21
27,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"That is an entirely different position. It is true, of course, that arguments can be adduced to the effect that we should be able to get large quantities of dollars from the United Kingdom. On the other hand, of course, tliere is this to be said, that we are keen to get this credit in the United Kingdom because that country is our best market. If we did not sell goods to the United Kingdom-and it is the selling of these goods that enables us to develop our sterling credits in London-wher e would we sell them? We should probably be unable to sell them in the United States of America, certainly not for dollars.",21
28,Mr HOLT,Unknown,To what goods is the Minister referring?,21
29,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,I am referring particularly to food items such as wheat and wool.,21
30,Mr HOLT,Unknown,Does the Minister claim that there is not a world market for wheat at present?,21
31,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"I am not claiming that there is not a world market for some commodities, but it would not be possible for us to sell wheat and meat to the United States of America. I remind honourable members that when the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Pollard) attempted to sell a small quanthe tity of butter to the United States of America he was confronted'-with many difficulties. That emphasizes the basic cause of the dollar shortage problem throughout the world, which concerns not only the countries of the British Commonwealth of Nations but also every other country in the world. It bas arisen because the United States of America is such a wealthy country, so far as natural resources are concerned, and because the techniques and methods of production in that country have advanced to such a stage that there is no need for its people to obtain commodities from any other country in the world. On the other hand other countries must obtain certain types of goods from the United States of America.",21
32,Mr RANKIN,Unknown,Do not the Americans like. want zinc and rubber?,21
33,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"They do not really us need rubber. The United States of America developed huge synthetic rubber plants during the war and could now, at a pinch, do without any natural rubber at all. Legislation in the United States compels manufacturers in that country to use specified proportions of synthetic and natural rubber. should make the difficulty of the dollar problem quite clear to honourable members. The need of the people of the United States of America to buy goods from other countriesis not nearly so great ' as is the need of other countries to obtain commodities from the United States of America. When speaking on this subject the other day, I explained that the conference in London had decided on a certain course of action. The present crisis is not the first crisis in relation to dollar problems. In fact it can be said to be the fourth of such crises. The first dollar shortage crisis occurred immediately after the war. That was met by a loan from the United States of America to the United Kingdom. The second crisis, which could be called the convertibility crisis, was overcome by certain action that adjusted the situation for the time being. At a later stage a critical situation again developed; it was met by the introduction of the European recovery programme. We are now facing the fourth crisis. No individual in the world has yet been able to provide a solution of this problem, the basis of which is the disbalance of the productive capacity of the United States of America compared with the production of other countries of the world. I consider that there are two ways in which the problem could at least be alleviated. One is the reduction of tariffs in the United States of America to enable the freer inflow of goods from other countries. The greatest contribution that that country could make to the economic prosperity of the world today would be to abolish all of its tariffs. Of course that would be very difficult to do because certain vested interests in the United States of America would lobby against such action being approved by Congress. I do not know whether it would be practicable for the United States to adopt that course.",21
34,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,Would there reciprocal arrangement? Mr Dedman.,22
35,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"No . We are dealing with the free flow of goods into the United States of America, which would help to alleviate the present position. The second way in which the problem That could be alleviated would be by the private investors in the United States of America adopting the technique of investors in the United Kingdom who were in a comparable position up to the end of the last century, and, indeed, up to the outbreak of World War I .",22
36,Mr LANG,Unknown,That would make the position very difficult.,22
37,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"I do not agree with the honourable member for Eeid. At that time, although the United Kingdom occupied the dominant economic position in the world, there was no difficulty about currency. The people of all countries could sell goods to whatever country they chose, change the money received into sterling, and subsequently change that sterling into the currency of any other country in the world. We want to get back to that position if at all possible. The world was then able to enjoy a system of that kind, free of limitations with relation to particular currencies. It was able to enjoy that pattern of trade because investors in the United Kingdom were able to send their money to any other country in the world, and whenever there was a disbalance of trade in any country it was counteracted by the investment policy of the United Kingdom. I am not referring to government policy.",22
38,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,Unknown, Order ! The Minister's time has expired.,22
39,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"New England) [11.53]. - Ha d it not been for the extraordinary speech of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) I should not have spoken to this motion. The Minister has told us that it is perfectly simple to understand why Australia cannot obtain a sufficiently large allotment of dollars to permit, this country to obtain adequate petrol and other fuel requirements in order to carry on its work and produce food to enable the be a starving people of Great Britain to be sustained at a reasonable standard of living. Through, its blind folly this Government has failed to understand Australian requirements. It has failed almost continuously to realise that it should be watching the interests of the people of this country, not preaching the doctrinaire socialism that it has constantly advocated. The Minister referred to the direct exports of gold from Australia to the United States of America, for which we receive dollar credits, based on a guaranteed purchasing price of 35 dollars per oz. That is one grip over credits for exports from. Australia given us in dollars by Great Britain and the sterling areas. The Minister went on to point out that before the war there was no difficulty regarding the convertibility of currencies. He said that if we accumulated sterling balances in London we could, if we so desired, convert them into dollars and buy what we needed from the United States of America. Under the existing system, our sterling balances in London are, as the honourable member for Beid (Mr Lang) has pointed out, frozen. In those circumstances, one would think that this Government would at least have preserved for us the raw material content in the exports of manufactured goods from the United Kingdom to the United States of America to which we are obviously entitled. A duty has always been levied upon imports of wool textiles and manufactured goods into the United States of America. At one time the duty upon imported textiles was based upon a charge of 35 cents per lb. in respect of the clean, scoured content of the wool. There was also an ad valorem duty upon the manufactured content of the cloth. Surely Australia is entitled to be credited with the dollars representing the raw content of textiles that are manufactured in Britain from Australian wool and exported to the United States of America. I remind the House that on the Minister's own admis-"" sion the dollar requirements of Australia amount to £70,000,000 a year. Our direct exports to the United States of America earn for us £50,000,000 a year. Therefore, our dollar deficit is £20,000,000 a year. If we were given the credit to which we are justly and legitimately entitled for the raw content of the goods manufactured from Australian raw materials that are exported from Britain to the dollar area, we should go a long way towards bridging the gap of £20,000,000 between our dollar requirements and our dollar earning. Wool and metals are exported from Australia to the sterling area, made into manufactured goods and re-exported to the dollar areas. If we were given credit for the raw content of those manufactured goods there would be no need for a huge staff of petrol ration officials in Australia because we should not be starved of petrol and oil. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction has suggested two means by which our dollar difficulties can be overcome. I remind the House that the dollar problem is not a problem with which we shall be faced decades ahead. It is with us now, and will cause stagnation and suffering in this country. The first "" Dedmanic"" suggestion is that there should be a reduction of American tariffs. Having said that, in the next breath the honourable gentleman contradicted what he had said at Havana and stated that other countries should not be required to make reciprocal tariff reductions. There will be a great chance of persuading the American Congress to agree to a reduction of American tariffs if other countries do not offer to reciprocate! The Minister has suggested that there should be a departure from the terms of the charter of the International Trade Organization, which he praised so lavishly in this House upon his return from one of his Cook's tours to Havana. The second solution of the problem that has been suggested by the Minister is that American private investors should be induced to invest their savings in sterling area countries, especially Australia and New Zealand. I advise the honourable gentleman to read a book written by Hazlitt, the American economist, entitled Will Dollars Save the World f I also urge him to read the reports of some of the conferences that took place at Bermuda between members of the United States of America Congress and members of Empire parliaments. It has been stated frankly that American private investors have no intention whatever to invest in socialistrun countries unless they are assured' that they will derive a reasonable return from their investments and that the industries in which they wish to invest will not be nationalized or treated in the same way as many industries have been treated in Australia and the United Kingdom. When the socialist governments of Australia and Great Britain are prepared' to play clean cricket with American private investors, no doubt those investors will what the private investors of Britainthe capitalists whom this socialistic Minister now praises-di d in the past, that is, invest in countries overseas. The British investors did that because they knew that their capital was secure. American investors will not lend their money to bushrangers, robbers, thieves and "" socializers "". I remind the Minister for Post-war Eeoonstruction that, for example, the loss of £25,000,000 in respect of the ground nuts scheme in Tanganyika is not the kind of socialistic experiment 1 that will encourage private investors to invest in countries with socialist governments. Our troubles cannot be cured in the ways that have been suggested by the Minister. It would take years to persuade the Americans to reduce their tariffs or to induce American private investors to repose confidence in this Socialist Government. The remedy is for our Ministers, especially the Minister for Post-war Eeoonstruction and the Prime Minister, when they go overseas, to forget their foreign descent or their international look and to remember what many of those whose forebears have lived in Australia for many years remember, that is, that with Australians Australia must come first and other nations of the world afterwards. When the Ministers of this Government attend conferences they must fight for the interests of Australia and forget their socialist doctrines and interdid nationalism. The interests of Australia should be their first consideration.",22
40,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Fremantle) [12.0] The honourable member for New England' (Mr Abbott), for the first minute of speech, threatened to be coherent, but, after that, when he was solving the dollar problem for us, and telling us, inciEngland, dentally, that Scots are foreigners, he became very confused. The fundathe mentals of the position in which Australia is today with respect to its need for dollars were touched' upon by the Minisour ter for Post-war Eeoonstruction (Mr. Dedman) when he stated that the world's dollar problem is caused by the unbalance between the enormous volume of American exports and the volume of American imports. The honourable member for New England has stated that American investors aro concerned at the do uature of governments in the United Kingdom and Australia and hence are not investing in the sterling area. That statement does not square with the volume of American investment that is occurring in the parts of the British Empire in which American investors consider that they will receive a reasonable return for their investments. Investment has nothing to do with the nature of governments. As a matter of cold fact, the volume of American investment in British enterprises now is far greater than it was in 1939. That in itself constitutes an aggravation of the dollar crisis for Great Britain, because it will have to pay the interest on those American investments by means of exports. There are four factors involved in the dollar crisis. The first is the unbalance between American exports and imports. That was aggravated by the war but has been modified by the generous American policy of making gifts. The Australian Country party, if the honourable member out- for New England spoke for it, which I can hardly believe, has changed its attitude in the last three years. When the United States of America was making gifts in the immediate post-war years, at the stage when it had made gifts amounting to 8,000,000,000 dollars to the rest of the world, thereby solving the dollar crisis of that time because other countries not have to pay for imports from the United States of America with goods of their own, the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) rose to his feet in this chamber and advocated a 1 policy of rigid imperial preference. That his policy would lock the Australian economy entirely within the sterling area. This morning the honourable member for New in the one coherent thread in his statement, criticized the way in which Australian Government had tied Australia to the sterling area, and suggested that we should have redirected many of exports with a view to earning dollars. I am not disputing that he has a case for that contention. I merely say to honourable members opposite that the right honourable member for Cowper found it convenient to pretend that he thought that there was going to be a lowering of world tariff barriers as a result of the Havana conference when he stated in this House, with full Australian Country party port, that he advocated a rigid policy of imperial preference. The point that must be frankly faced, is that some sacrifices are being made by Australia for reasons of high policy. The fundamental changes that have occurred in the economic position of Britain in the decade since 1939 have nothing whatever to do with the political colour of any particular British government. Before the war Britain received £230,000,000 sterling worth of goods from overseas investments which, at today's values, would represent about £500.000,000 worth. It received these goods literally for nothing because they represented interest on investments that Britain had accumulated abroad for a century. It was a conservative government in Great Britain which, quite rightly in view of the exigencies of the war, sold up, for instance, £700,000,000 worth of British investments in the Tjnited States. That £700,000,000 worth of factories and other equipment was handed over to United States interests as payment for arms. It is childish to pretend, therefore, that the diminished volume of imports from the United States that Great Britain oan now finance as a result of its sale of those interests has anything to do with the conservatism of Mr Churchill or the socialism of Mr. Attlee. It has only to do with what Britain was forced to do to finance its war effort. During and immediately after the war there was no dollar crisis because the United States sustained the British economy to the extent of one billion dollars worth of food a year, for nothing. After the war, when that aid was suddenly discontinued, the British Government was labouring under the impact of two crises that had nothing to do with the political complexion of the government in office. The first crisis was that Britain was no longer receiving that American aid, which was cut off before Britain's industries could be reconverted to peace-time production in order to finance Britain's imports. The second crisis was that Britain suddenly had to assume great obligations in Europe. After all, it is costing Britain £S00,000,000 worth of dollars a year to occupy Germany. That means, in effect that food that Britain either earns with its exports or obtains on credit from this sup- country has had to be diverted to the occupied territory. In fact, to a large degree, the British occupation policy in Germany is based on the provision of food to the Germans.",24
41,Mr HOLT,Unknown,I think that the honourable member has added a nought to his figure of British occupation costs.,25
42,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"No , I have given the cost of the occupation at least in the first two years.",25
43,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"I think that the figure should be £80,000,000, not £800,000,000.",25
44,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"If I have been inaccurate in that respect I apologize to the House, but the point I am making is that at the time when direct aid to Britain from America ceased, Britain suddenly had increased obligations imposed on the British larder, because of the responsibility to contribute to the feeding of the German people and the British occupation forces in Germany. Criticism has. been directed at the policy of maintaining a sterling balance in London. Australia has a sterling balance of £451,000,000 in London, the accumulation of which arose from the fact that we have given Great Britain that amount of credit. I disagree with the statement of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction that we ought to the grateful to Great Britain for taking that volume of our goods, because Great Britain is our best market. The point is that in a world where there is a seller's market, it has been essential, to British economy that Great Britain should be sustained by such credit. In the long run it is essential to Australia's economy that Great Britain sbould be so sustained. At the present time such sustenance on the part of Australia involves a sacrifice for us. The Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) may argue that we could gain dollars by selling zinc direct to the United States instead of exporting it to London, whence it may be re-exportod to the United States. The honourable member for New England may argue that we eould be getting a greater rake-off in dollars if we sold wool direct to the United States. He has not proved conclusively to me, and did not attempt to prove to the House, that the £20,000,000 gap between our dollar earnings and our annual withdrawals from the dollar pool could be gained in that way. We are getting £70,000,000 worth of dollars a year from Great Britain and our exports are earning £50,000,000 worth of dollars. The honourable member did not prove conclusively that the direct sale to the United States of wool now sent to Great Britain and manufactured into goods there would have itself bridged that £20,000,000 gap. - Mr ABBOTT - I referred to the content of woollen goods manufactured in Great Britain and exported to the United States. The honourable member should not twist what I said.",25
45,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I am not twisting what the honourable member said. He argued that if these re-exports from Great Britain had been sold by us direct to the United States they could have earned for us £20)000,000 worth of dollars to bridge our dollar gap, but he advanced nothing to prove his statement. He left his assertion to stand on its own. In any event the particular category of goods is not important. It is purely the matter of the gap of £20,000,000 worth of dollars that we are discussing. The point is that, even if we have to make dollar sacrifices to do so, there is a strong case for our sustaining the British economy at the present time, because the British economy is, in some respects, being distorted for reasons of high policy to sustain certain parts of Europe. It is deplorable to hear from honourable members opposite this perpetual pretence that the socialist Government in Great Britain has caused the present economic crisis in. that country.",26
46,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,Unknown, Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,26
47,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"Barker) [12.12] - I am deeply indebted to the Minister for Post-war Eeoonstruction (Mr Dedman) for his contribution to this debate. I was elected to this Parliament fifteen years ago, and in that time. I have heard member after member of the Labour party declare that the antisocialist parties were responsible for the Premiers plan. This morning the Minister has said that the honourable member for Eeid (Mr Lang) was responsible for that plan. He quoted official documents not only to show that the honourable member for Eeid was responsible for the plan, but also to show that that honourable member had presided at a conference in 1930 at which the plan was decided upon. My recollection of these documents is that the people who presided over that conference were the Minister's predecessors in the Scullin Ministry.",26
48,Mr LANG,Unknown,"What became of the Lang plan ? raw Mr AECHIE CAMEEON - I do not, know by what means an Australian government of a Labour complexion abdicates its right to preside over a conference of State Premiers. I am also under a great debt of gratitude to the Minister for his statement that Dr Coombs does not control the Commonwealth Bank.",26
49,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,I said nothing of the kind.,26
50,Mr AECHIE CAMEEON,Unknown,I do not think that the Minister ever knows what he says. He should have two Hansards to record his conflicting utterances. What the honourable gentleman said was that the policy of the Commonwealth Bank is determined by the Commonwealth Treasurer.,26
51,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,I said no such thing! Mr AECH IE CAMERON - He also said that that policy was in accordance with the policy laid down by the Labour party.,26
52,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,I said that it was in accordance with the financial policy of this country.,26
53,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,The financial policy of this country today is the financial policy of the Labour party alone.,26
54,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,That is right!,26
55,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"This policy problem is a most interesting one. Yesterday I received an answer from the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) regarding financial policy. As that information is official it ought to be factual and truthful. I asked my question in order to ibring up to date ngures which were given to me in reply to a similar question that I asked about a year ago. According to the reply I received, our imports from dollar areas last year were valued at nearly £54,000,000, representing £41,500,000 from the Tjnited States of America, nearly £12,000,000 from Canada, and £375,000 from all other dollar areas. Another important fact concerning dollars is that of our total imports from dollar areas, oils, fats and waxes, which include petrol and lubricants, accounted for under £6,000,000, so that for that period of twelve months our payments under that heading was 11 per cent, of our total dollar commitments.",26
56,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,It is the biggest single item of those imports.,27
57,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"No . According to the reply furnished to me by the Treasurer, imports of metals and machinery from dollar areas during that period were valued at £21,500,000. In addition, imports of apparel and textiles were valued at £2,500,000 compared with imports valued at £16,000,000 for the preceding year, and imports of tobacco were valued at £3,500,000. In 1948-49 Australia's exports to the United .States cf America were valued at approximately £32,300,000, our exports to Canada at approximately £8,500,000 and our exports to other dollar areas at approximately £1,500,000. I recognize that those sums do not include certain payments such as payments in respect of interest and debt commitments due at New Tork. Incidentally, I remind honourable members opposite that Mr Theodore, when he was Premier of Queensland, floated in the United States of America loans on which Australia has to pay the highest rate of interest it has ever paid for overseas loans ; and that debt is still not paid. I understand that Mr Theodore was Commonwealth Treasurer at the time when the Premiers plan was agreed to. The total value of the exports which I have indicated exceeds £40,000,000, whilst our interest bill payable in New York does not amount to very many millions. The year before last we expended in the United States of America £900,000 on travel and £1,400,000 on royalties in respect of motion pictures. On the latter item we could effect a considerable saving by changing over to British-produced motion pictures. The question before the Chair is whether the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank ought to be brought to the bar of the House for questioning by honourable members. I should be quite happy to see him brought here, because I should like to ask him a few questions, as I should like to ask a few questions of the Treasurer, who is the real head of the Commonwealth Bank. Until we get some better method of controlling the Commonwealth Bank than we now have, I do not think that our position will be altogether secure.",27
58,Mr DUTHIE,Unknown,"The honourable member is against controls. Mr ARCH IE CAMERON - I have always been opposed to dictatorships, and the present control of the Commonwealth Bank is a dictatorship. The Government abolished the Commonwealth Bank Board and placed the bank under the nominal control of one man. We know that that man is responsible to the Treasurer. The proposal that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank should be brought to the bar of the Parliament is important. We have certain financial difficulties ahead. Whether the Prime Minister is hoping to get out of office before they arise I do not know; but I do know that there is a lot to :be explained by the Government with regard to dollars. The information which the Treasurer gave to me yesterday on the subject of dollars calls for more explanation than I had ever hoped I should have reason to demand. Members of the Government can talk as much as they like about the dollar problem:. The real trouble is that we are not offering goods at prices which other countries are prepared to pay for them. That fact was made very clear yesterday by Mr. Black, the president of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, when he delivered what I took to be something in the nature of an ultimatum to certain governments in the sterling area, including the Australian Government, because the sins of those governments which he enumerated are very well laid to the charge of this Government. He referred to increasing coats of production and the serious impact of costs of social services upon the budgets of certam sterling countries. No country in the sterling area has so much to answer for in that respect as haa the Australian Government, unless, perhaps, it is the Government of New Zealand. I notice that the Treasurer i» making a note. It is time that he told the Parliament whether he agrees, or disagrees, with Mr Black's statement.",27
59,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,Unknown," - The honourable member's time has expired. Mr CHIFIiEY (Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer) [12.23] - I thought that the question before the House was whether the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank should be called to the bar of the House to explain certain matters enumerated in the motion moved hy the honourable member for Eeid (Mr. Lang), including an examination regarding the international monetary position with particular reference to the dollar crisis, Australia's international reserves, the price of gold and international exchange problems generally. Some of those matters relate to the International Monetary Fund, whilst others relate to matters discussed at the ""Washington conference. As a governor of the International Monetary Fund and also of the International Bank for Eeoonstruction and Development, I am probably as well informed on the work of those organizations and with respect to their views and probable decisions as is anybody else. I say that solely to indicate that I have an opportunity to be kept fully informed of the work of those organizations. Mr MCFarlane, who was formerly Secretary of the Treasury, is a director of the International Monetary Fund and also of the International Bank for Eeoonstruction and Development. wish to emphasize one point. I gathered from the remarks of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) that he applauded the statement by Mr. Black, the present chairman of the International Monetary Fund, that certain social services provided in some sterling countries are too costly. The honourable member implied that in that respect Mr. Black ""pointed the bone"" at Australia and also at the Government of the United Kingdom. I suggest that the honourable member should have a word with members of his own party about that subject because they have been invited to go to the country and tell the people that they propose to reduce social services benefits, but, strange to say, I have seen advertisements sponsored by representatives of the Opposition in which it is offering to increase certain social services benefits. The honourable member should have a heart-to-heart talk with his colleagues about that matter. With respect to social services in Great Britain, not long ago Mr Churchill had the opportunity to move a motion of censure of the Government in the House of Commons, and he almost threatened to do so, following the announcement by Mr Aneurin Bevan of the provision of additional social services benefits, but I noticed that the Opposition parties in Great Britain ran away from that issue at the crucial moment. I guarantee that at the next British general elections the British Conservative parties will not threaten to reduce any of the social services now enjoyed by the British people. I also draw attention to the fact that President Truman, who was elected despite considerable opposition and the greatest optimism on the part of the hostile American press, made it clear not long ago that he himself stood for increased social security for the American people. Mr Black, or any one else who advocates a reduction of the social service standards now enjoyed throughout the world, is welcome to put that on his election banner. I come now to the other point raised by the honourable member for Eeid. I can easily understand the feelings of the man in the street in this country who, having ample money' of his own and knowing of our I substantial balances overseas, finds that he is still unable to buy goods from the United States of America or other hardcurrency countries-suc h as Portugal, Belgium, or Switzerland. The simple answer, of course, is that, although the man himself has the necessary money, and this country has substantial funds in London, it is not the right kind of money. It is not the sort of money that will enable him to buy the things that he wants from hard, currency areas. On some islands, the currency is seashells and all kinds of goods can he bought with seashells; but that does not mean that a person from one of those islands can go to New York and buy even a pack of cigarettes with seashells. Mr TURNBUI/L - It was possible to do that with Australian currency before.",28
60,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"No . The practice in the past, as any former Treasurer of this country will agree, has been to buy dollars from the Bank of England. We did not send our money to America, Switzerland, or any other hard currency area. The Bank of England had plenty of dollars, and was able to sell dollars for sterling and meet dollar debts in other countries. I repeat that, although we may have plenty of money in this country and ample overseas reserves, it is not the right sort of money. It is not money that the American business man will accept for his goods. That is just as true of the English £1, the franc, the lira, the kroner and other world currencies.",29
61,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,What about the Swiss franc ?,29
62,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"There again is an anomaly. Dollars are at a discount in Switzerland. Switzerland, and to a certain degree Belgium and some Middle East countries, including Persia, will not accept dollars.",29
63,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,How does the right honourable gentleman explain that in relation to Belgium ?,29
64,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I am afraid that I should have to occupy more than the time allotted to me in this discussion to explain that to honourable members. Belgium at present is able to earn all the dollars ' that it requires through sales of Belgian goods to the United States of America. It has been able to build up substantial reserves of dollars. That is true also of Russia, which, until recently, when America refused to supply in return the goods that Russia required, was able to earn substantial dollar payments by exporting manganese and chrome to the United States of America. The matter is too complicated to be dealt with briefly. Nothing could be gained by having Dr Coombs called to the bar of the House.",29
65,Mr LANG,Unknown,Would that not be desirable in the interests of the public?,29
66,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"No . I repeat that the answer to the question why we cannot buy American goods is that we have not the right sort of money to buy them. That is true of all the easy currency countries. The honourable member for Barker dealt with exports and imports, but he did not refer to the invisible expenditure that has to be met. For instance, the Canadian Finance Minister, Mr Abbott, has pointed out that the great influx of American capital into Canada means that substantial dividends have to be paid out of Canada to the United States of America. I do not suggest that American investments in Canada have not helped its development, but they mean that, in this dollar crisis, Canada has to pay out large sums of money to the United States of America in dividends. Remittances to the United States of America from shows such as ""Annie get Your Gun"", ""Oklahoma"" or films, are not of great significance. These are amenities. Man cannot live by bread alone. He must have something else to make life liveable. However, although items of invisible expenditure may be small in themselves they probably aggregate 90,000,000 or 100,000,000 dollars annually. Then there are boot machines and other machines imported from the United States of America and operated under licence. All these things mean that it is necessary to export much more than we import to make up the deficit. I shall endeavour to answer some points that have been raised by honourable members more fully during the budget debate.",29
67,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, Order ! The right honourable gentleman's time has expired.,29
68,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [12.33] There are many reasons why I consider that the proposal of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) has merit. I remember the morning when Sir Robert Gibson, then Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board, was brought to the bar of the Senate and was asked questions by honourable senators. Dr Coombs and the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) are codictators of Australian finance - As Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, Dr Coombs bas great power over the welfare and happiness of the people of this country and over its destinies. His only superior is the Treasurer. There are many reasons why Dr Coombs should be called to the bar of this House. I wish to correct one statement made by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) in his attempt to be historical. He should be sure of his facts; his misstatement has already been corrected by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), but again I draw attention to the fact that it was a Labour government that opposed the Premiers plan, which was supported by all political parties. The Premiers plan, involving all States, was propounded as the result of the failure of the Scullin Government to find a way out of the financial depression. 1930-31, unemployment in this country was 24.13 per cent. In the following financial year it reached 30.7 per cent. Not until the Premiers plan had been formulated and the Scullin Government swept from office did unemployment figures begin to decline. Honourable members opposite, including the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward), have constantly reiterated that the great depression which occurred in this country in the 'thirties had something to do with the non-socialist parties. Every one, of course, knows that it was a worldto wide depression that began in the United States of America because of the isolationist trade policy adopted by that country which caused unemployment to rise to very high levels. After the socialist Government had been got rid of in Australia in 1931 unemployment in this country began to decline. Statistics issued' by the League of Nations at that time show that Australia made a more rapid recovery from the effects of the depression than did most countries. As this Parliament is shortly coming to a close, it is only right that the facts relating to the depression should be made clear to the people. The depth of the depression was reached when a Labour government was in office. Undoubtedly, today the United States is enjoying the greatest share of world trade, but we must remember that during the war Great Britain lost 70 per cent. Mr White. of its export trade while the export trade of the United States was trebled. During the war British factories were smashed by enemy action, it lost 230,000 men in battle and 100,000 persons in the blitz and its trade was disorganized. Great Britain had to sell its investments abroad in order to pay for munitions and food at a time when it and the Dominions stood alone against the Nazi forces. There should be a different outlook on Great Britain's plight today. Great Britain owes no moral debt to any nation. Its position has been made more difficult by the great credits which have been built up in Great Britain by countries like Egypt, India and Australia. Every effort should be made to find a way out of its difficulties. This is no new experience In for Britain. After the Napoleonic war Great Britain was overshadowed by allies of greater man-power. A similar state of affairs has existed since the termination of World War II . This Government has not made a proper approach to the problems that confront the British Commonwealth. It sent the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and an army of bureaucrats, including Dr Coombs, to Geneva, to negotiate an agreement on tariffs and trade. On paper the proposals may have seemed excellent. They appeared solve all the difficulties of nations and' individuals, .and they were swallowed whole by the Minister and his advisers. After some months the honourable gentleman and his advisers went to Havana. Subsequently, Australia became a signatory to the Havana Charter which sabotages Empire preferential trade. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr. Beazley) has said that Empire preferential trade would have shut out America, or words to that effect. It would not have done so. Under the reciprocal Empire trade arrangements that operated before and after the signing of the Ottawa Agreement a great volume of trade circulated within the British Empire. Provision had also been made therein for trade treaties with foreign countries; hut today that and the protectionist policy of the Labour Government have been placed in jeopardy. This Government has adopted a policy of restriction and still further restriction. We cannot obtain from the United States the petrol, the tractor parts and the capital .equipment needed by our primary and secondary industries. An examination of the customs figures shows that there are many items, apart from petrol, for which dollars are needed. Petrol imports account for only £A.6,000,000 per annum. Our total annual imports from dollar countries amount in value to £A.53,000,000, including £6,750,000 for motor vehicles and chassis, £3,250,000 for timber and £3,000,000 for textiles, particularly those made of cotton. In earlier years Australia grew more than 20,000 bales of cotton. Now, the crop has dropped to fewer than 1,000 bales. This Government has allowed the Australian cotton industry to wilt. A large area in central Queensland, which was formerly developed for the growing of cotton is now going out of production. The trade aspect of Australia's economy has been grossly neglected hy this Government, because during the war, when it had to spend money lavishly, it did not have the foresight to consider these things. I exhort the Government to heed the requests of the honourable member for Beid. It is true that we may not get all we hope for from the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, but that is no reason why he should not be called to the har of the House to give us the benefit of his advice. Let the'Government give us an opportunity to question him on this important matter. To-day the Government is adopting a policy of restriction piled on restriction. Capital equipment needed for our development is being needlessly denied as. Por a time after the conclusion of World War I . , Germany had no gold. It was in debt to the world and in addition had to meet heavy payments for reparations. Notwithstanding those handicaps Germany was able to expand ite trade and so strengthen itself as to challenge and almost defeat the world a few years later. It is true that' the methods it adopted were not orthodox. In some instances they were dishonest. Germany reverted to the system of bilateral agreements which had heen followed hy Empire countries. That system has heen abandoned by this Government in favour of the multilateral agreement system, Under the latter system, in order to reach a trade agreement with a oountry favourable to us we have to agree to yield certain concessions to other countries. This system brings ahout undesirable "" repercussions without improving our trade position. The real wealth of any eountry consists not in its currency holdings hut in its production. The Government should re-examine the whole position of our international trade in order that it may formulate a policy which will enable Australia's development to proceed. Last month I was in the north-west of Western Australia where our great cattle stations are located. I was shocked to find that that region is being de-populated because of neglect on the part of this Government and that, as a result, splendid opportunities for supplying increased quantities of beef to the hungry peoples of the world are heing lost. The Government should re-examine its policy in relation to trade and international finance. Let it call the Opposition .parties into conference and see if some better effort cannot be made to meet this problem.",29
69,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member's time has expired. Question resolved in the negative. House adjourned at 12.43 p.m. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. The following answers io questions were circulated:NA HOSPITAL: DISTBIBUTION OF PUBLICATIONS. Dame ENI D LYONS asked the Minister, for Repatriation, upon notice I. Has the medical superintendent or the secretary of the Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood, Perth, been empowered to exercise supreme authority over the voluntary distribu* tion hy outside welfare bodies of magazines and other reading matter to patients in that hospital; if BO, for what purpose? 2. If not, why are only representatives of the .Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia or battalion auxiliaries permitted to distribute reading matter to these hospital patients? 3. If no restriction on - the distribution of magazines' has been ordered by the Minister or officials of his department, wiil he ask the medical superintendent or the secretary to allow other welfare bodies to distribute reading matter to patients at regular intervals?",31
70,Mr BABHABD,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are aB follows:l . NTo. 2 and 3. There are 25 organizations visiting the hospitals now. The administration endeavours to be as liberal as possible in permitting visitations by welfare bodies, but there must. be some limitation as excessive visiting can interfere with treatment. Visiting hours, both day and night, are generous and persons interested in the patients are welcome during those hours to provide suitable reading matter. Any organization can forward books and magazines for distribution to the patients, and the distribution will be gladly undertaken by the hospital authorities. The publications can be suitably marked by the organization providing them if that is desired by them, BO that they may be identified with their action of making them available. SHIPPIN G: CLKARAWOE OF CARGOES.  the honourable member for Franklin (Mr. Falkinder) asked the following question :Will the Minister for Trade and Customs have an investigation made into the excessive delays occasioned by the Department of Trade and Customs in the slow clearance of cargoes from overseas and interstate ships in Australian ports to the firms to which the goods are consigned? The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following information:A survey over the last two months in the States of New South Wales and Victoria has disclosed that the maximum delay in clearing any cargo through the customs has been three days, and the average maximum delay has been slightly under two days. Customs officers at the mam ports work overtime in order to keep delay in clearance of cargoes to a minimum. I might add that the statement that the Department of Trade and Customs is to blame for delays in clearance of cargoes is frequently a popular and convenient excuse for neglect on the part of others concerned. Apparently it' is not generally realized that the clearance of goods requires action also from shipping companies, consignees and. customs agents. Complaints made .by importers as to delays in clearing their goods have been investigated and, almost invariably, the fault has been proved to lie with themselves or their agents.",32
