In addressing that budget 1) 2003-2004, I want to proceed in three stages: phy, ideas and ideals which circumscribe the ondly, to examine its direct implications for Flinders, which takes in the communities of Peninsula; and, thirdly, to examine some of the a result of the budget. Firstly, in turning to the question of philosophy, speech, I drew a distinction between two core freedom and, secondly, that of equality. I noted paid respect to each of those values-both freedom distinction between the two parties is that the means of achieving equality-that it was an the social democrat tradition, was to focus achieving freedom.

There is a second difference, cause one of the key things we see is that societies moral hazard-the threat of negative long-term cult long-term decisions.
