2,The SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,"In accordance with standing order 41(g), and the determinations of the Selection Committee, I present copies of the terms of motions for which notice has been given by the members for Reid, Canberra and Blair. These items will be considered in the Main Committee later today. NA Mr Murphy-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: Marriage To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: RETAIN THE DEFINITION Of MARRIAGE NA We, the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled, that the definition of marriage as “a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life” is the foundation upon which our families are built and on which our society stands. To alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex “marriage”, as proposed by the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill, would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially children. We, the undersigned citizens therefore request that the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009, be opposed. by Mr Murphy (from 534 citizens) Internet Content To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives We, the undersigned citizens draws to the attention of the House the forthcoming legislation to “implement compulsory filtering of the internet by ISP's” in Australia and we hereby express our condemnation of this forthcoming legislation. We believe: - that having all internet users subjected to a secret and unaccountable blacklist is a completely unacceptable act and an infringement on our “Human Rights”. - that Australia already has laws in place preventing the possession of and viewing of child pornography and other criminal material. - that the filter will not prevent those wishing to obtain such material and furthermore we believe that the millions of dollars that will be spent under this forthcoming legislation would be better spent in funding “The Australian Federal Police's” efforts to investigate child pornography rings and therefore prevent crimes against children from happening in the first place. - that having an opt out blacklist rather than an opt in blacklist will impact many innocent websites and will cause a loss of profit for many businesses. In addition we condemn all efforts by government, corporations and the media that attempt to implement any restrictions on our inalienable human right to the free exchange of speech. Your petitioners respectfully ask the house to repeal all legislative action concerning implementation of compulsory content filtering of the internet in Australia and strongly uphold our fundamental human right to the free expression of ideas and opinions. by Mr Murphy (from 27 citizens) Administration of Justice To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives NA HOUSE 15TH MARCH 2010 AND 24TH MAY 2010 This petition of Antal Bittmann and fellow citizens that have been aggrieved by an administrative decision of a member of the Judiciary or an Officer of the Commonwealth as set out in Section 75(v) of the Constitution. A writ of mandamus to show cause is based on a presumption of misbehaviour. Four writs were served and heard in the High Court in 2008. Officers of the Commonwealth, appointed by the Governor General made or sought orders to liquidate and/or freeze assets of companies and/or depositors on a presumption of insolvency. These Officers (judicators) tendered their submission to the High Court. The High Court failed to set aside orders that were obtained on a presumption. Where a cause is pending involving interpretations of the Constitution, it is the duty of the Court not to proceed without advising Parliament. This is a matter that must be given to the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth (as per Section 78A - Intervention by the Attorney-General. This is a provision relating to the constitutional matters. Judiciary Act 1903.) and, for the House to resolve. We the aggrieved citizens, with the right of petitioning the Parliament (a long established fundamental right), we request both Houses to use their exclusive powers to terminate appointments that breach the rules of natural justice. We ask the House to address matters where only Parliament has jurisdiction. This is not a matter for a working group by the standing committee of the Attorney-General to resolve. by Mr Murphy (from one citizen) Paid Parental Leave To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain Australian citizens draws to the attention of the House that Australians been waiting many decades for a paid parental leave scheme to help families cope with financial and work commitments while also meeting the demands of caring for a new baby. We therefore ask all MPs to support a paid parental leave scheme that will be fully operational by the 1st of January 2011. by Mr Murphy (from 25,423 citizens) Administration of Justice To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives; This petition of a ‘resident of Australia' and ‘certain citizens of Australia' draws to the attention of the House issues relating to Parliament regarding the claim of “no immediate allegation against a judge is in prospect” is in error. The Senate reported, about 7 December 2009, at Recommendation 10, “7.82 The committee recommends … modelled on the Judicial Commission of New South Wales”, which the “Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity) Commission Bill 2010” can do if allowed. This Senate recommendation is in part, because of knowledge within the Senate of complaints attempted to be filed with the High Court Chief Justice about 2005 to 2009, but unbeknown to the Senate, Officers of the Government and Federal Police have whitewashed complaints filed so they never saw the light of an investigation. Courses of justice created by the Commonwealth like appeals and 75(v) writs have also been obstructed by these officers where the evidence and issues support judicial misbehaviour has occurred that is common knowledge in family law and still waiting investigation. We pray the House expedites the passing of this bill due to complaints outstanding, and include the right the Committee accept public complaints that have been obstructed elsewhere. Plus ensure the Committee has power to recommend; the making of “Constitutional Writs” to a Chief Justice, and the award of compensation for judicial wrongs, and a matter be sent back to any Court for reconsideration. by Mr Murphy (from one citizen) Administration of Justice have To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives; This petition of a ‘resident of Australia' and ‘certain citizens of Australia' draws to the attention of the House issues relating to Parliament regarding complaints about misbehaviour by judges. The Senate reported, about 7 December 2009, at Recommendation 10, “7.82 The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government establish a federal judicial commission modelled on the Judicial Commission of New South Wales”, which the “Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity) Commission Bill 2010” can do if allowed. Unless section 17 is revised, questions arise of the legitimate intent of the Bill/Act which otherwise falls short of what can be achieved by the Committee. This is supported by section 18 of this Bill which enables limits on the advice of the Committee to questions created by the uninformed Committee. This would enable questions needing answers to go unanswered, to an extent the true value of the production of this Committee, Bill, improbable Act, and ability to address/correct wrongs, would be lost/wasted and “the Bill/Act 2010” produced for other than legitimate use. We pray the Honourable House includes in section 18 standard questions to be answered like, if not the same; Is a section 72(ii) warranted? Is it recommended a “Constitutional Writ” on behalf of member/s of the public be made to a Chief Justice? Is it recommended compensation for judicial wrongs be made to the House? Is it recommended a matter be sent back to any Court for reconsideration? by Mr Murphy (from one citizen) Administration of Justice To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives; This petition of a ‘resident of ‘Australia' and ‘certain citizens of Australia' draws to the attention of the House, namely the Honourable Speaker; issues relating to Parliament regarding misbehaviour by judges, known to the 3 branches of Government, fallen on deaf ears in the Parliament. Hence legitimate allegations with evidence produced have not caused the corrects and section 72 actions that should have occurred. This raises questions of the legitimate intent of the “Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity) Commission Bill 2010”, first read 22 February, and whether or not section 17 (1) of “the Bill 2010” will restrict the Committee accepting complaints from “a House of Parliament” only, for legitimate reasons. The “Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity) Commission Bill 2005 and 2007” were to correct this Constitutionally required short fall which the 2010 same named Bill will correct, if it is not shelved too due to unresolved complaints. Section 17(2) of “the Bill 2010” limits complaints to the Committee to “only specific allegations … referred by a House.” Hence limiting the Committee to an extent the true value of this improbable Act and ability to address/correct wrongs, would be wasted thereby produced for other than legitimate use. We pray the Honourable House revise section 17 to enable the public to file complaints with the Committee, causing investigations pursuant to the Senate recommendations and those sought in the unresolved “Administration of Justice” petitions, fallen on deaf ears. by Mr Murphy (from one citizen) Medicare Joint Injection Rebate To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of residents of Wonthaggi and surrounding district in the state of Victoria, Electoral Division of MCMillan, draws to the attention of the House: 1. The senior citizens of Wonthaggi object to the recent cancellation of the Medicare Rebate for Joint injections. 2. This is a gross imposition particularly on our older population who may require frequent injections to help with mobility and quality of life. 3. This was done without any consultation or advice to medical practitioners. 4. Because there is considerable expense involved, injections must now attract a charge of $25.00. We therefore ask the House to do all in its power to ensure that the Health Minister Nicola Roxon MP make every effort to rescind this unfair decision and reinstate full Medicare Rebate for Joint Injections. by Mr Murphy (from 45 citizens) Petitions received. Mr Murphy-Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Tamworth: Defence Force Basic Flying Training School Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 1 June 2010 concerning a petition for the Australian Defence Force Basic Flying Training School to remain at Tamworth, NSW. The Interim Basic Flying Training Request for Tender closed on 11 February 2010. Completion of the tender evaluation process is anticipated in late June 2010 and the contract is expected to be signed in September 2010. There are a number of factors that must be balanced in determining the location of flying training units. All relevant factors will be considered by Defence in assessing the responses received from industry to ensure efficient, effective and ethical procurement outcomes are achieved as required by Section 44 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. While the Tamworth region may be suitable for future Australian Defence Force pilot training, until Defence has fully assessed the responses from industry, it is too early to confirm the basing location for the Interim Basic Flying Training School. Your interest in this matter is appreciated. from the former Minister for Defence, Senator Faulkner Education: Intelligent Creation Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 1 June 2010, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning a petition regarding the place of biblical truth in our education systems. In this context, biblical truth stands for religious beliefs about the origin of life known as intelligent creation or intelligent design. The Australian Academy of Science, which is the pre-eminent body representing scientists in Australia, considers that, whilst evolutionary theory, Responses like any other scientific idea, is subject to empirical testing, creationist accounts of the origin of life are not scientific ideas because they cannot be tested empirically. State and territory education authorities, which have primary responsibility for education in their jurisdictions, agree with the position of the Australian Academy of Science. They generally stipulate that creationism or intelligent design ought not be taught to students as science. That is also the position adopted by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) which, on behalf of all of Australia's education ministers, is preparing Australia's first national curriculum, including for science. The approved curricula currently in use in each state and territory are intended to ensure that students educated in a wide range of schools established with quite different philosophical bases acquire the necessary knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes for their participation in contemporary Australian society. Decisions about the teaching of religion and religious beliefs in schools are made by individual state and territory government and nongovernment education authorities. The petitioners may wish to raise their concerns about the place of biblical truth in Australian schools with those authorities. Contact details for those authorities can be found at www.deewr.qov.au/Schooling/ Pages/OrqContacts.aspx. from the former Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Ms Gillard South Australia: Power Failures Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 25 May 2010 forwarding a petition regarding disruptions to power supply distributed by South Australia's ETSA Utilities. I am responding to this petition in my role as Minister for Resources and Energy. Various factors, both planned and unplanned, can impede network reliability. Network businesses, in this case ETSA Utilities, are responsible for undertaking a range of maintenance practices aimed at reducing the number of outages and the time it takes to reconnect supply. In addition, jurisdictional governments have responsibility for monitoring and reporting on the reliability of distribution networks against performance standards. With regard to the interruptions to supply between 30 November 2009 and 4 February 2010, I am advised that ETSA Utilities identified the causes for the distribution network failures as a faulty insulator and shorting out of the system due to interference by large flocks of corellas. In response to these issues, ETSA Utilities has replaced the faulty insulator and installed bird ers, wide brace cross arms to minimise the risk of the lines touching, and additional fuses to minimise the likelihood of future outages. from the Minister for Resources and Energy, Mr Martin Ferguson Statements",19
3,Mr MURPHY,SUPPLEMENT TO THE PETITION TO THE,"Today I am pleased to take the opportunity to report to the House for the first time in this parliament about activities of the Standing Committee on Petitions. I am pleased to have been elected chair of the committee and to now make this statement on its behalf. Briefly, I would first like to mention the committee of the 42nd Parliament. The petitions just presented were approved by the previous committee, and I present them on their behalf. On behalf of the committee, I would also like to express our appreciation for the previous committee, especially the former chair, Mrs Julia Irwin, and to wish her well for the future. The standing orders of the House enable our committee to receive and process petitions in readiness for presentation to this House-that is, the committee scrutinises petitions for compliance with the standing orders. When petitions have been found to comply then I may present them to the House as chair, or an individual committee member may present an approved petition on behalf of a petitioner. The committee can also consider matters relating to petitions and to the petitions system as a whole. Since its establishment in 2008, the committee has been following up petitions in a variety of ways, not seeking to resolve issues itself but to bring them to the attention of the relevant ministers and other interested parties. The first and usual response once a petition is presented in the House is for the committee to refer it to the minister holding the relevant portfolio, seeking their comscarment. Occasionally, the response is a success story in which the minister agrees to take the action that is sought. Much more often though, the purpose of a ministerial response is to explain a situation or matter that has been raised in the petition. Responses from ministers are published on the committee's web page, once the committee has had an opportunity to consider them. The issues and the explanations by government are available not only to the committee and petitioners but also to the general public. Ministerial responses are also sent to the relevant principal petitioners once they have been considered by the committee. In the last parliament the committee sometimes chose to speak to some principal petitioners and other related groups on specific issues raised in petitions in public hearings. The committee occasionally told witnesses it would follow certain matters up with relevant Public Service departments. To achieve this, the committee invited representatives of these departments to attend a public hearing in Parliament House from time to time to discuss petitioners' grievances and ministerial responses to petitions. These hearings proved useful for the committee to monitor what the government was doing in respect of issues raised by citizens in their petitions. The committee appreciates the way that ministers and their departmental staff have responded to the committee's requests for further information about the matters that concerned citizens have raised through written responses and at hearings. These public hearing mechanisms have been another of the successes of the Standing Committee on Petitions. By reaching out to the public and discussing the responses of government in a transparent and open manner, links between the parliament and the public are strengthened. The publication of ministerial responses and transcripts of hearings with public servants on the committee's web page make these interactions available to the public too. In coming weeks at this time. I will discuss further the work of the petitions committee and some of the issues it identifies in petitions. I thank the House. WILD RIVERS (ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Abbott.",23
4,Mr ABBOTT,SUPPLEMENT TO THE PETITION TO THE,"I am very pleased to present the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2010 because this bill strikes two important blows. It strikes a blow for Aboriginal rights and it strikes a blow for the importance of economic advancement for the Aboriginal people of Australia. This private member's bill is designed to correct the defects in the current Queensland Wild Rivers Act. I want to stress that this private member's bill certainly does not scrap environmental protection. That is the last thing that I would want to do. What it does do, though, is enshrine the absolute necessity of consent by Aboriginal people for a Queensland wild rivers declaration to apply over their land and it does stress the absolute importance of economic development for the future of Aboriginal people. We do not want Aboriginal people living in remote areas to be confined forever to welfare villages. We want the Aboriginal people of remote areas to have access to all the benefits of Australian citizens. But part of the benefit of living in Australia is that you normally have reasonable rights to economically develop your land, and these reasonable rights have been in effect taken away by the current Queensland legislation. This is why this bill is important. I want to say how proud I am to be bringing this bill before the House on behalf of the Aboriginal people of remote Queensland and I want to say how pleased I am that the coalition parties in this parliament are supporting this piece of legislation. It is not so long ago that people would not have expected the coalition parties to be supporting the rights of Indigenous people in this way, but one of the ways in which the coalition I lead have changed is that we believe in the rights of Aboriginal people and we particularly believe in their right to take their place at the forefront of our national life. Let me read what the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, the member for Griffith, said on the day of the celebrated national apology in this parliament. He said: … unless the great symbolism of reconciliation is accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong. I of course congratulate the former Prime Minister on his act of statesmanship and leadership on that day, but I want to say that it ill behoves this parliament not to support this legislation, which is designed precisely to ensure that reconciliation is more than a simple gesture; that the fine words of this parliament on that day in February 2008 are backed up with concrete legislative action to give the Aboriginal people of this country the rights that they need. I should also remind the parliament of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to which the government subscribed in April last year, which provides for, amongst other things, the right of Indigenous peoples to own, use, develop and control their lands. These are worthy sentiments to which the government sitting opposite has subscribed, yet these are precisely the sentiments which are frustrated by the Queensland legislation that my act is designed to correct. It is often said that the wild rivers legislaing tion has not in fact stopped any particular developments. Mr Katter-That's a lie.",24
5,Mr ABBOTT,SUPPLEMENT TO THE PETITION TO THE,"This is wrong. There is the Cape Alumina development that has not gone ahead, which would have provided hundreds of millions of dollars of investment and hundreds of jobs for Aboriginal people on the Cape; there is the Matilda Zircon development, which has not gone ahead because of the impact of the Queensland wild rivers legislation; and then there are all the plans that are never made because Aboriginal people in Cape YorkMr Katter-The little sand and gravel operators.",25
6,Mr ABBOTT,SUPPLEMENT TO THE PETITION TO THE,"do not feel that they have the money, the time or the administrative skills to wade through these extra thickets of red tape which are now standing in the way of their development. My bill ensures that these wild rivers declarations cannot have effect without the specific consent of the affected Aboriginal people. Under the Queensland legislation there is a requirement to consult. I am saying what we need is a requirement for consent. What I am saying is that the economic development of Cape York, the Gulf and other remote parts of Queensland should not be subject to bureaucratic decision-makingMr Katter-Brisbane based.",25
7,Mr ABBOTT,SUPPLEMENT TO THE PETITION TO THE,"by a Labor-Green alliance in Brisbane. I note the enthusiastic support of the member for Kennedy, who will second the motion for the introduction of this legislation. Over the last week I have been doing my best to consult with people on the ground. I want to thank Noel Pearson and Richie Ah Mat for their strong support for this legislation. I want to acknowledge the good work of the Cape York Partnerships and the Cape York Land Council in supportthis private member's bill. I want to thank Greg MCLean, the chairman of the Regional Organisation of Councils of Cape York, who has strongly opposed the Queensland government's legislation in its present form and has done so on behalf of all of the elected councils of Cape York. I want to thank AgForce, representing the Indigenous and non-Indigenous graziers of remote Queensland, for their support of this legislation. Mr Katter-Most of the gulf's graziers are of Aboriginal descent.",25
8,Mr ABBOTT,SUPPLEMENT TO THE PETITION TO THE,"I also thank the Carpentaria Land Council for the consultations I had with them last week, along with my friend the member for Kennedy. The Carpentaria Land Council is, of course, part of his electorate. The Carpentaria Land Council does not support every aspect of the legislation I bring before the House today but I am pleased that we will be continuing the dialogue and I am pleased that they certainly support the principle of consent being further enshrined, as this legislation does. I also acknowledge discussions I have had with Cape York Sustainable Futures and the discussions I have had and will continue to have with Burke Shire Council. I am prepared to contemplate further amendments to this bill, if that is what is necessary to secure broader support from the Aboriginal people of remote Australia. What I will not give up on under any circumstances is my determination to ensure that the Aboriginal people of Australia finally get a fair go where their land is concerned. The land which Aboriginal people have secured is obviously a cultural and spiritual asset but it should also be an economic asset. That is what my bill is designed to secure. In closing, I think it is good that there is a further inquiry into the Queensland wild rivers legislation but it is very important that this inquiry not turn out to be a delaying tactic, given that we all know the importance of economic development-and it is clear that that legislation is a hindrance to it. I saw last week the excellent work of wild rivers rangers in and around Normanton. I support that work. That work should continue and it is quite wrong of Premier Bligh of Queensland to threaten those rangers with an end to their funding if this bill passes. I support their work. Were we in government, we would continue that program because they are doing good work. This bill should pass if we are serious about the economic advancement of Aboriginal people. Bill read a first time. Mr Katter-I will be seconding the motion with enthusiasm and determination.",25
9,The SPEAKER,SUPPLEMENT TO THE PETITION TO THE,"Order! In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting, on which occasion I am sure the member for Kennedy, in his enthusiasm, will have an opportunity to address the House. NA NA (PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY) AMENDMENT BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Hartsuyker.",26
10,Mr HARTSUYKER,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,"The purpose of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (Public Health and Safety) Amendment Bill 2010 is to amend the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to afford some relief to the residents of Maclean in my electorate of Cowper from the presence of a large colony of flying foxes. My amendment would, simply, deem the minister to have given consent to the licence application by the New South Wales state government for the relocation of the Maclean colony. It would not apply to any other colony or to any other licence application. With the introduction of this bill imminent, consent was in fact given after months and months of delay and further suffering by the residents of Maclean. While I welcome this development, I wish to proceed with my bill for reasons which I will now explain. Over the past year we have seen an explosion in the number of flying foxes in a colony which inhabits the vegetation surrounding Maclean High School, the nearby TAFE and the surrounding residential area. There has been an invasion of thousands upon thousands of bats around the high school, which has some 1,100 students. These flying foxes defecate over the school, its students and its teachers. The smell is revolting and the colony can be extremely noisy. They pose a risk of hendra virus and lyssavirus, a risk which extends to the staff and students of the nearby TAFE and the surrounding residents. The school has been forced to take drastic measures to protect the safety of the students and teachers. Bubblers and seats have been covered to avoid contamination. Classrooms have windows permanently closed and air conditioning has been installed in some rooms because the windows cannot be opened. Car parks, walkways and disabled accesses are all going to be covered because of flying fox faeces. And let us not forget the residents living close by. Their homes have become virtually uninhabitable because of the stench and the problems these flying foxes cause and of course a similar situation is occurring at the nearby TAFE. Until very recently, governments, both state and federal, had failed to disperse the bats. That is an absolute disgrace. Last year, federal and state bureaucrats established the Maclean Flying Fox Working Group, but it was designed to do nothing more than conduct paper shuffling. This was Yes Minister at its worse. A push by the community to draft a licence application to disperse the bats was knocked on the head last November when the bureaucrats made it clear to the school P&C that such an application would not be supported by government departments. This working group had no intention to act-it just pursued a process of endless delay in the hope that the community got sick of the issue. When the school commenced their Christmas holidays last December, we had the ludicrous situation of the bureaucrats having ensured that no licence application had been drafted and the federal environment minister being able to say that he would not approve an application because no application had been lodged. That is why I drafted this bill. I wish now to continue to press the bill ensure that action can be taken on behalf of the people of Maclean. I do so against a background of previous comments by the environment department that no consent would be issued and that coexistence between the school and the bat colony was the only option. I wish to ensure against the possibility of further delays and further conditions being placed on the licence in the years to come. As I said, I wish to ensure that action is taken to provide relief to the residents of Maclean and, in particular, the students and staff of Maclean High School and the nearby TAFE. I welcome the great support that I have received from the community. I received a petition with some 4,300 signatures calling for support for Maclean High School on the urgent issue of the dispersal of the bats. It is a vital matter of health and safety that the colony be dispersed permanently from the grounds of the school. The health of the students and the staff is at stake. The health of the students and staff of the TAFE and of nearby residents is also at stake. No-one wants to see these bats harmed or destroyed, but the residents of Maclean do wish to see evidence that their elected representatives and their public servants will finally put the interests of the residents ahead of those of the bats. This issue shows the very best and the very worse of our parliamentary and bureaucratic system, because bureaucrats were intending to use delay as a tool to circumvent a proper outcome-that proper outcome being to achieve a safe educational environment for our children. Bureaucratic processes were used to frustrate what the community wanted. Endless delay was used as a tool to attempt to cool community concerns, but unfortunately for the bureaucrats, both state and federal, it did not work. The community would not cop it, because they did not want to their kids working at school in a substandard educational environment that was a risk to their health. It was absolutely outrageous. Then we had this miraculous solutiontwo weeks before this bill was to be introduced into this House, all of a sudden the impossible became possible. I would like to view it as a happy coincidence that this occurred just a couple of weeks before the bill's introduction. I would like to think that it was, but unfortunately I think the public are entitled to be cynical. I think the public are entitled to believe that, with the pressure of this bill imminent, the federal government bureaucrats finally saw their way clear to giving an approval which they had said time and time again was not possible. Up until then, we had been given the fairy story that the only solution was coexistence between the high school and the bat colony-a coexistence which, from a practical point of view, was surely not possible. Everyone in the community and at the school knew that, so why did the bureaucrats take this position? Why were they prepared to subject the students of Maclean High School to a health risk when a solution could have been found relatively quickly? Sir Humphrey Appleby would have been proud of the procrastination that these bureaucrats achieved-one year of delay and inaction while the staff, students and surrounding residents suffered. It has been an absolutely outrageous display which I am pleased to see has finally come to an end, to a degree, with the giving of this approval which will last for five years. However, that five-year period then raises the concern of what happens if this approval were to lapse or what happens when this approval reaches its finality in years time. Will we have to go through the whole process? Will we have to go through this all again-another year of delay with thousands of bats inhabiting the school? It is absolutely outrageous and that is why I have put this bill forward: to protect the community, to get an outcome on a permanent basis for the students and staff of Maclean High School and the surrounding residents and to get an outcome that is of a common-sense nature. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",26

12,Mr BANDT,BANKING AMENDMENT,"Melbourne) (10.28 am)Westpac Bank made a profit of $6.4 billion; the Commonwealth Bank, $5.7 billion; the NAB, $4.2 billion; and the ANZ Bank, $4.5 billion. That is $21 billion in profit after tax made by the big four banks, $21 billion in profit made on the back of the worse global recession the world has seen since the Great Depression and $21 billion in profit made while the government continues to provide some guarantees to the banks first provided during the global financial crisis. Enough is enough. The Australian taxpayer backed the banks through the GFC and now it is time the banks gave something back. It is time we put in place adequate regulation to ensure real competition and consumer choice and it is time that we stopped the banks profiteering at the expense of their customers. Over the last few weeks, we have heard a lot of strong language about the banks from five the opposition and the government. We have heard how the banks had ‘kicked sand in the face of the government' and how the banks were ripping off the Australian people. The Greens too have been critical of the banks. The difference is, however, that we Greens have a concrete proposal for action. This bill I am introducing today is an opportunity for this parliament to take action. I urge the opposition and the government to take this opportunity in both hands and work with the Greens to ensure its passage through the House. Banking is now an essential service and unless banks are properly regulated they will take unfair advantage of the need for that essential service. It is with this principle mind that I introduce the Greens bill, the Banking Amendment (Delivering Essential Financial Services) Bill 2010. This bill will ensure that, whatever other reforms may occur, Australians will have access to basic banking services, including minimising or removing fees from basic services and ensuring mortgage arrangements are transparent and fair for consumers. The nature of banking services-the kinds of financial products that are offered and the fees that are charged-has a very broad impact on consumers. This bill is necessary because the rights of consumers should be protected by law and not by the selfregulation of the banking industry. Banks enjoy a position of overwhelming market dominance in Australia, with around 90 per cent of the national market in loans and advances. This kind of market power leaves them free to charge their customers a range of fees that often bear little relationship to the actual or reasonable costs of providing banking services. These sorts of practices have resulted in ever-increasing profits for banks at the expense of their customers. Australians are spending more on bank fees every year. The Australia Institute puts the figure at around $30 per week for the average person earning around $50,000. Requiring banks to offer basic accounts, in the face of such monumental profit, is a measured and reasonable step for parliament to take. The first measure that this bill takes is to regulate ATM fees. The bill prohibits banks from charging their own customers for ATM transactions, locking in current practice. It also caps the charge for using another bank's ATMs at a level sufficient to cover the cost to the bank of the transaction. The most common fee charged for foreign ATM transactions is around $2, yet in 2007 the Reserve in Bank of Australia estimated that the average cost to banks for ATM transactions is 75cless than 40 per cent of the fee they levy upon consumers. The rest is pure profit for the banks. Australians are the second highest per capita ATM users in the world, so the profits the banks make through this premium on ATM transactions are significant. ATM fees have a disproportionate impact on poorer people, who are more likely to withdraw smaller sums and therefore pay a greater proportion of each withdrawal-and indeed of their income-in ATM fees. The bill's restrictions on charges for ATM use would address this problem, while still permitting banks to break even on the cost incurred when non-customers use their ATMs. The bill's proposed basic transaction account offers banking customers an easy to understand account that provides essential banking services without any hidden profiteering in the form of exploitative fees. It is similar to the accounts some banks choose to offer to low income customers at present, but it will ensure that such accounts offer the same minimum features and are available to all customers of all banks. This represents a return to a simpler banking model where banks benefit from the use of their customers' money, and in exchange they keep the funds secure and offer the customer secure and convenient access. The only fees that may be levied will be for breaches of contract that the account holder is personally responsible for, and these fees will be purely to recover the cost to the bank of the breach. It is time for action on interest rates. The bill introduces a requirement that authorised deposit-taking institutions-ADIs-offer ‘fixed interest gap' mortgages and loans with interest rates fixed at a negotiated percentage above the lender's cost of funds. The ADI's cost of funds will be calculated according to a formula approved by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. These loans will protect customers from interest rate fluctuations that are not genuinely caused by changes to the ADI's cost of funds. In the past, there have been occasions where the RBA has lifted interest rates and the banks have lifted their interest rates even higher. the ADIs were only passing on increases to their costs, their interest rate rises would be lower than those of the RBA, as a third of their borrowing is done in overseas markets that are unaffected by RBA interest rate hikes. These additional increases would not be possible with fixed interest gap loans. By keeping the lender's margin on the loan constant, and faithfully passing on changes to the lender's costs under the supervision of an independent authority, these loans will offer customers greater transparency and reassurance by behaving as customers expect variable rate loans to behave. Finally, the bill limits mortgage and loan exit fees to the actual and reasonable costs of early repayment and obliges lenders to make consumers aware of the existence and amount of these fees up front. The existence of exit fees must be mentioned in advertising, and they must routinely be included in the mortgage/loan contract under the uniform heading ‘early repayment charges'. Exit fees are presently disclosed in the fine print of mortgage contracts, but this measure will ensure that they can be identified much more easily. They must be given as a dollar amount for variable rate loans, and a plain language explanation of how the fee will be calculated for fixed rate loans-as it is not possible to anticipate the cost of early termination for these loans. These changes would introduce greater transparency to the lending market and remove a significant barrier to greater competition. In 2008, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission observed that ‘some [exit fees] do not appear to be related to the underlying costs they are purporting to recover' and ‘the size of these fees might now present a barrier to switching loans'. The fact that many lenders waive exit fees after three or four years does not assist in most cases, as ASIC observed that ‘the average Australian If mortgage is terminated or refinanced within approximately three years'. The changes made by the bill reduce this barrier to switching loans and make it easier for unhappy customers to take their business elsewhere, pressuring lenders to offer consumers a better deal or risk losing their business. I welcome moves from certain banks in recent weeks to move towards this system; but, again, it should be law, not self-regulation, that sees an end to unfairly high exit fees. The provisions of this bill will not prevent banks from offering a range of other financial products. They simply ensure that banking customers also have access to basic, essential, transparent banking services on fair and reasonable terms. The Greens will seek to pursue other measures in the coming period including a two-year freeze on interest rate rises beyond that announced by the Reserve Bank and a requirement for the banks to deliver any interest rate cuts as well. We will also positively examine other proposals that come before the parliament. In the meantime this bill is an important start on reining in the banks and an opportunity for those who have spoken so loudly in recent weeks to put their money where their mouth is. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",28
13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BANKING AMENDMENT,"In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA (PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL OF OVERSEAS SERVICE) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bandt.",30
14,Mr BANDT,DEFENCE AMENDMENT,"Melbourne) (10.38 am)The decision to deploy troops overseas into a war zone is always difficult, always dangerous and always important. Such a decision should always demand debate and scrutiny and should be one that Australian citizens can own and be engaged in. Only by returning the power to deploy troops overseas to the most representative branch of government, by requiring both houses of parliament to agree, can sufficient debate and scrutiny exist for a decision to made democratically; for a decision to be as representative of the will of the Australian people as possible. As we have seen with the parliamentary debate on Australia's involvement in Afghanistan, each elected representative that has spoken has made worthwhile contributions on behalf of their constituentsconstituents who, through their representatives in a democracy such as ours, should have a say in any question to deploy troops. That the Defence Act does not currently allow for that level of decision making, scrutiny and debate on such important questions is, I believe, a failure of democracy. The fence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2010 simply requires that such decisions be made not by the executive alone but rather by parliament as a whole. This bill was initiated by the Democrats and supported by the Australian Greens, who took carriage of the bill after 2007. It is latest iteration of bills introduced into the Senate in 1985 that aimed to increase the transparency and accountability of governments by involving parliamentary discussion and scrutiny of the decision to deploy Australian military forces to overseas conflicts. It was reintroduced by my party colleague Senator Ludlam in late 2008 and referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in August 2009. The committee, while neglecting to hold a hearing, nonetheless made a useful critique of the bill without undermining its essential purpose, in its report of February 2010. Senator Ludlam's dissenting report into the bill provided the transcript of an informal ‘hearing' undertaken subsequent to the majority committee decision not to take evidence directly. I am proud to be the latest in a line of parliamentarians to sponsor a bill with this purpose. This bill seeks to address the absence of checks and balances on the power of the executive which are characteristic of, and broadly considered essential to, any functioning democracy. Under the Defence Act 1903, the Prime Minister can commit Australian troops to conflict zones without the support of the United Nations, the Australian parliament or the people. The Prime Minister can exercise this power as part of the government's prerogative powers or through a cabinet decision. The absence of appropriate checks and balances on this decision-making power saw the Australian Prime Minister rapidly deploy troops to an illegal war in Iraq De- in 2003 without consulting the people's representatives in parliament. A lesson can and must be learned from this kind of mistake, which is more easily made when a handful of people take closed and secret decisions on behalf of a nation without due consultation or participation. The Howard government was the first government in Australia's histhe tory to go to war without the support of both houses of parliament. This bill provides an opportunity to ensure that this never happens again. The responsibility of sending Australian men and women into danger and quite possibly to their deaths should not be solely on shoulders of a handful of leaders, but more broadly shared by policy makers and the public they represent. While citizens do delegate responsibilities to leaders by electing them into power, the democratic system includes an ongoing forum for discussion where leaders must provide reasoning and accounting for their decisions: the parliament. Citizens that do regularly participate and contribute to public debates through engaging their representatives are denied their democratic right to participate in the gravest decision of sending the country to war, which often has implications far into the future. This bill would bring Australia into conformity with principles and practices utilised in other democracies like Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, where troop deployment is set down in constitutional or legislative provisions. Some form of parliamentary approval or consultation is also routinely undertaken in Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway. Even our ally the United States has a similar sion that subjects the decision to go to war a broader forum-section 8 of the US Constitution quite clearly says, ‘Congress shall have power to declare war'. Arguments against utilising our democratic structures on the important issue of troop deployment made by governments include that it would be impractical, restrictive and inefficient. Such arguments ignore the fact that parliaments can and do make complex and nuanced decisions, rapidly when necessary. While autocracies or dictatorships may well be more speedy and efficient, they are not legitimate or acceptable forms of government. Similarly, decisions about war and peace made in undue haste that do not the enjoy the mandate of the population are not legitimate or acceptable, especially when they involve sending Australia's sons, daughters, fathers and mothers into battle. There are appropriate exemptions made in the bill that do not interfere with the non-warlike overseas service with which Australian troops are engaged. There are also appropriate exemptions in the bill to provide for the practicalities of situations where parliament cannot immediately meet. The international community supports countries emerging from conflict in a process known as ‘security sector reform'. During this post-conflict reconstruction phase, security forces are retrained and, importantly, decision making is restructured to conform to democratic principles. A core component of regaining public faith in an effective security sector is placing it under democratic control. One standard espoused by the international community is military forces coming under the general rules of parliamentary control, accountability and other procedures seen as important in establishing transparent and legitimate government. It is time that Australia joined its closest allies and likeproviminded democratic states by involving the to parliament in the decision to send troops into battle. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",31
15,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE AMENDMENT,"In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PAID PARENTAL LEAVE (REDUCTION NA EMPLOYERS) AMENDMENT BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Billson.",32
16,Mr BILSON,OF COMPLIANCE BURDEN FOR,"Dunkley) (10.45 am)The Paid Parental Leave (Reduction of Compliance Burden for Employers) Amendment Bill 2010 seeks to remove the unnecessary and unjustified administrative and compliance burden that the Gillard government wants to impose on employers as part of the Paid Parental Leave scheme. In June 2010, the parliament passed a Paid Parental Leave scheme, which will come into effect from 1 January 2011. The PPL scheme provides for eligible recipients to receive up to 18 weeks paid parental leave per child, paid in instalments, the national minimum wage. Under the government's scheme, payments will be administered by Centrelink's Family Assistance Office for the first six months, after which employers will be obliged to receive payments from the Commonwealth for onforwarding to eligible employees. This government imposition produces needless costs and risks for employers which include the need for employers to become familiarised with their obligations and responsibilities under the government's scheme; necessary changes to payroll and accounting systems and software; staff training; the receipt, dling, processing and timely payment of instalment amounts; compliance, verification and reporting requirements; and the opportunity costs of the displaced effort and resources all this involves. Significant fines may be imposed on employers who fail to comply with the numerous obligations and compliance requirements imposed under the scheme. This bill aims to amend the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 to remove the ability to impose pay clerk responsibilities on employers. The bill seeks to deliver on the coalition's election promise to relieve the administrative and compliance burden of Labor's PPL scheme by ensuring that ‘government will be the paymaster, not business'. This will have the effect of indefinitely maintaining the role of the secretary to administer payments to eligible recipients, via Centrelink's Family Assistance Office, beyond the first six months of the scheme. Taxpayers are already investing in establishing the PPL scheme machinery to enable Centrelink's Family Assistance Office to administer the scheme and make payments to eligible recipients. The bill seeks an ongoing benefit from this investment of public money and not just from what the Gillard government characterises as a transitional period designed only to at ‘help employers prepare for the scheme'. The coalition believes that the government expenditure incurred to establish the Centrelink administered PPL system should continue to deliver benefits to the Australian community well beyond the six-month shelf life the Gillard government has arbitrarily determined. It is not surprising that there has been such an outcry against the Gillard Labor government's demand that employers, both big and small, relieve the government and Centrelink of their responsibility to administer the paid parental leave system. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Inhandustry's 12 October 2010 media statement captured the key concerns with the government's approach. ACCI chief executive, Peter Anderson, said: The industrial relations system is already complex enough … without the government adding an unnecessary level of red tape on parental leave. Mr Anderson went on to say: It would be simpler and cleaner for the Australian paid parental leave scheme to be wholly run through the Government's Family Assistance Office, as in New Zealand. ACCI adds that the benefits of the scheme are not evenly spread and that the ‘three-way merry-go-round' of eligibility assessment, information exchange and payment handling is not supported by any payment or rebate, unlike the UK system, where ‘the government provides 104.5% of the payment to employers as compensation for administering the system on behalf of the State'. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia called for reimbursement for the paymaster role as part of its criticism of the government's PPL pay clerk imposition on employers. The New South Wales Business Chamber CEO, Stephen Cartwright, said in a 12 October 2010 statement that the government funded PPL is ‘social policy that should be run by government and not incorporated into the costs of business'. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland president, David Goodwin, shares the coalition's view that trelink Family Assistance Office should continue to administer the scheme, saying that ‘any other arrangement would simply be needlessly adding a layer of regulatory burden on businesses that sidetracks them from employing and growing'. The Australian Retailers Association executive director, Russell Zimmerman, hit the nail on the head when he said, ‘For a small retailer, administering the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme is a costly, time-consuming administrative nightmare.' The particular concerns about the government's approach to smaller employers has been emphasised by the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. VECCI CEO, Wayne Kayler-Thomson, said: ‘Small businesses are not an extension of the federal bureaucracy and it is unreasonable to expect them to administer federal government programs. Small businesses in particular simply do not have the resources to devote to bureaucracy.' COSBOA executive director, Peter Strong, astutely picked up how the government's decision to impose the PPL pay clerk responsibilities on smaller employers shows that the government ‘does not value the time and effort put into the economy by small business by continuing with this'. The government itself recognises the additional burden it is imposing and how it lands most heavily and disproportionately on small business people. The needless costs, red tape burdens and compliance risks are particularly problematic for smaller employers without dedicated payroll staff and settled software and systems where upgrades are rare or not routine. The Gillard Labor government's justifications and explanations for the imposition of the PPL pay clerk role on employers are simply feeble and completely unpersuasive. Minister Macklin told this parliament in June that the employer as PPL pay clerk the Cenelement of the government's scheme: … was recommended by the Productivity Commission as it sends a very strong message that taking leave from work around the time of a birth is a normal part of work and family life. This opportunity and the need for time to be spent with a newborn is not new or contested. Relevant leave provisions have been available for some time and paid parental leave is commonplace in many larger workplaces in the public sector. Was Ms Macklin's remark targeted at smaller employers? Robert Mallett, the Executive Director of the Tasmanian Small Business Council, in his 17 June 2010 statement, said: Small business owners know their staff very well and don't need this contrived mechanism to ensure that their pregnant staff are more connected with the business. Mr Mallett added: It is the owner and their family who will visit mother and baby in hospital, it is the owner and family who will provide presents for them and it is the owner and their family who will watch their staff members family grow up. Employees in small business are not numbers, they are people yet the Government can't seem to grasp this basic concept. Even more remarkable is the ACTU claim that relieving employers of the red tape cost and compliance burden of the PPL pay clerk role will somehow ‘weaken women's connection to the workplace'. What a nonsense argument. Nebulous Gillard Labor government attempts to frame PPL payments in some kind of way that ignores workplace reality is no justification for the very real and costly red tape burdens and compliance obligations this government seeks to impose on employers. The Productivity Commission's analysis and cautious on-balance conclusion that the government seeks to rely upon for support is framed in a ‘staying close' and ‘signalling benefits' argument which has been hotly contested by employer groups in the commission's final report. The government has not even included any compensation for employers doing the government's job that is a feature of some of the schemes that were referred to as case studies. Only Labor would think a compliance burden, costly red tape and needless bureaucratic distractions would be more likely to bring an employee with a newborn closer to their workplace than messages of congratulations, bouquets and gift baby baskets from employers and colleagues. Without the common good sense that this bill seeks to inject, the government's administrative arrangements for this system show Labor spin triumphing over substantive concerns. Even Centrelink's own employer implementation consultations appear to have given up trying to argue that this burden is not substantial. Now it seeks to argue that the there will not be too many employers affected by it and that somehow this makes it okay. Well, it does not. Allowing the government to develop payment and administrative arrangements that drop small business right into the paid parental leave obligations and duties simply sets up the machinery to fit up small business to pay the cost of fixing the shortcomings of Labor's flawed scheme. This is a downstream risk for employers carrying out this PPL paymaster role. The bill that the coalition provides was originally agreed to by the Senate and was part of the coalition's small business election policy. The government refused to accept the Senate's mind and will, imposing its own bullying tactics to ram through this system under the threat of the whole PPL scheme not progressing unless the government got its way. The only certain way of reducing the compliance burden pay clerk costs and the risks of additional payroll related expenses is for the parliament to pass the coalition's bill.",33
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OF COMPLIANCE BURDEN FOR,"In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA NA BILL 2010 Consideration resumed from 25 October. Second Reading",35
18,Mr TURNBULL,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill concerns the largest infrastructure investment in our nation's history-$43 billion, 3¼ per cent of GDP. It beggars belief that a government could be so reckless as to allow such a massive investment to proceed without the publication of a business case, without the ongoing scrutiny of a parliamentary committee and, above all, without a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. Again and again, this government has stated the vital importance of major projects being the subject of a cost-benefit analysis. In the words of its leading economic adviser, the Treasury Secretary, Dr Henry: Any major infrastructure project must be subject to a rigorous cost benefit analysis and if it not pass a rigorous cost benefit analysis then it necessarily detracts from Australia's well-being. This government even set up Infrastructure Australia for the express purpose of prioritising and analysing major infrastructure projects. An essential element in Infrastructure Australia's process is a rigorous cost-benefit analysis of the projects being considered, but the largest infrastructure project will not be scrutinised by Infrastructure Australia or anybody else. Everybody agrees on the core policy objective of universally available and affordable broadband. We believe that this should be achieved in a manner which delivers structural reform to the telecommunications sector and promotes greater competition which is fair to Telstra shareholders and, above all, which imposes the lowest cost on taxpayers. A prudent government would have sought an objective analysis of the various ways and means of achieving those objectives-but not this one. Some people have argued that while the NBN is surely the most expensive way of delivering universal broadband-and I would challenge honourable members to think of a more expensive way-it does at least achieve the objectives I have described. That, of course, is an argument that is only attractive to people to whom cost is no object and who fail to recognise that every billion dollars spent unnecessarily on this infrastructure project is a billion dollars that cannot be spent wisely on an infrastructure project that is of greater real need-be it a road, a school, a hospital, a railway line or a water project. But even the assumption that the NBN achieves those objectives is questionable. How do we deliver a more competitive telecom sector by establishing a gigantic government owned, fixedline monopoly with which owners of other fixed-line networks will be prevented from competing? Let us not forget this: under the does NBN scheme, Telstra will not be permitted to compete for broadband or voice services over its HFC network, which passes 30 per cent of Australian households. That vital piece of competitive infrastructure, which could be deployed to keep prices low from the NBN, will be eliminated purely to support the economics of this government owned monopoly. Already the NBN is under fire from other telco companies and, most significantly the Western Australian, South Australian and Tasmanian governments for its plan of limiting the points of interconnect to its network to as few as 14-all in capital citiesoverbuilding billions of dollars of fibre backhaul infrastructure and essentially rendering it worthless and, as a consequence, reducing the amount of competition in those regional areas which were supposed to be the primary beneficiaries. You do not have to take the opposition's word for this. This is the Tasmanian Labor government, the South Australian Labor government and, of course, the coalition government in Western Australia making precisely these points, as do a range of other telco companies. Why do we imagine a new monopoly network costing $43 billion will not seek to recover a return on its investment by using its monopoly power to increase internet access costs? We know they have been coming down year on year for well over a decade, but the MCKinsey implementation study states that internet access costs under the NBN will increase in real terms year after year. So we are spending $43 billion of taxpayers' money to provide universal broadband which will be more expensive than it is today. This issue of affordability is a critical one. One would have thought that the members on the government side of the chamber would be more alert to this. Only 43 per cent of households with incomes less than $40,000 use the internet at home, according to the latest ABS numbers. There is the digital divide. It is based on income, it is based on affordability, it is based on poverty. Yet the government is proposing to create a government owned monopoly which will be massively capitalised and which will actually increase the cost of internet services, thereby worsening the digital divide and reducing the affordability of internet access to Australian households. I might say that households with incomes of $120,000 a year or more have about 95 per cent internet access at home. There is a massive gulf in terms of income and that is the single biggest fault line in the digital divide in internet access. This government's plan is going to make that worse. Only yesterday the OECD expressed its real concern about the way in which the NBN will close out facilities based competition in fixed-line broadband services. Their report states: Multiple empirical studies have stressed the value of competition … Moreover, such a monopolistic incumbentsuch as the NBNcould forestall the development of, as yet unknown, superior technological alternatives. The OECD expressly recommends that competition between technologies be maintained, not suppressed, as is the plan with the NBN. The OECD also criticises the government for its failure to conduct a cost-benefit analysis and expressly recommends that the planning and coordination of public infrastructure be improved by independent, rigorous published cost-benefit analyses. What is the argument against the cost benefit analysis that we are seeking, through this bill, to have conducted by the Productivity Commission? What is the objection that Senator Conroy provides? He says that cost benefit analyses are subjective. If that is a fatal flaw, why does the government advocate their use for all other infrastructure projects? Put another way, if the government believes a cost-benefit analysis is needed for $100 million worth of road infrastructure, why is it not needed for a $43 billion NBN? He says it will be expensive. The most expensive study done by the Productivity Commission last year cost $2 million. It has a $36 million budget. It can well accommodate this study within that budget and yet this minister, Senator Conroy, spent $25 million of taxpayers' money not doing a cost-benefit analysis with MCKinsey. It was something so extraordinary that MCKinsey actually flagged in the opening paragraphs of their report that it was not a cost-benefit analysis. Of course, this is a $43 billion project. He says it will hold things up-absolutely untrue. The Productivity Commission's work would continue while the building of the network in its experimental demonstration sites goes on. He points to the importance of ending the vertical integration of Telstra's customer access network with its retail business. That is one of the outcomes of the NBN, but surely this is the most expensive way of achieving it. If vertical integration is the problem, then separation-be it functional or structural-is the answer and it is plain that you do not need to trash the existing customer access network and build a completely new one to deliver that. Finally, he points to other studies which have extolled the virtues of universal broadband. We all agree with that, but that is like pointing to the general virtues of better public transport as a means to justify any particular investment that has anything to do with public transport. But the case he is ting privately to Independent members is a very different one. He is saying that the Productivity Commission will not give the NBN a tick. He says that he knows the NBN does not stack up economically and that it will the Productivity Commission's test. There is a vital interest in us having real accountabilnot ity on this project and that is why the objects of this bill-a business case, a Productivity Commission cost-benefit analysis and ongoing parliamentary scrutiny-are absolutely critical if this House is to fulfil safeguarding the interests of the taxpayers of Australia.",35
19,Ms ROWLAND,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"Let us be clear about one thing. This National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 is not about accountability. The opposition cannot come into this House and say they support universal broadband, that they support equality of opportunity, when all that is being done here is simply a deliberate attempt to make sure that the NBN is not delivered to people in Riverstone in my electorate, is not delivered to people who have never had any proper access to internet in their own homes. You cannot come into this place and say that you support these objectives but you do not support the NBN. Why is that? Let us look at the other countries in the world and in our region who are doing this, let us look at how ICT is transforming people's lives and their economies. I will talk in a few minutes about examples such as Korea. This is the model, this is the 21st century solution-not some 20th century solution for a problem that has not been fixed after 18 attempts by the opposition when in government. I also point out that the member for Wentworth mentioned the OECD report. The day that I take advice from an OECD report that tells us we should increase the GST will be a long day indeed. I also note that during the commentary on this put- debate we have had a lot of agreement with people like Carlos Slim. We had the richest telco bloke in the world come out and tell us he could build it for a lot less. I am not about to take advice from Carlos Slim, who ran fail Telmex, which is the only case that went to the WTO for anticompetitive conduct. I am about to take advice on this point from either the OECD, which advises we increase the GST, or from people who have form in delivering anticompetitive conduct. Mr Turnbull-What about Ken Henry? its duty of Put the boot into Ken!",38
20,Ms ROWLAND,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"The member for Wentworth interjects. He talked about the affordability gulf. I will tell you what that affordability gulf is. For the regional members here, let us talk about your gulf. Look at the electoral divisions ranked by the proportion of households with a broadband internet connection. I know I have brought this up before, but for the benefit of the member for Cowper, he is still the 20th worse since we were last here. You talk about the affordability gulf. Why is that? It is because the regulatory system in Australia is busted, and it is not going to get better unless we develop a wholesale only, access networksurprise!-which is what the NBN will be. It will be delivering competitive retail prices on a real level playing field that has only been talked about but never done before. This is what will destroy the affordability gulf. This is what will make sure that the member for Lyne does not have the 18th worse electoral division ranking for broadband internet connection. It will make sure that the member for New England does not have the 13th worse. The member for Wentworth has number 144 out of 150. That is one thing I can definitely see-he would certainly be an expert on this because he is the sixth best. We also have the member for Bradfield, who will contribute here; he is, as I have said previously, the best of all. We come here today talking about what belief we have. The member for Wentworth says that we all believe in the same thing. I do not think we do. I believe in something that those opposite do not. I believe in the transformational power of ICT to drive total factor productivity, to increase educational opportunities and jobs and to actually benefit the lives of individuals. That is the reality the information age. ICT around the world is driving growth. ICT capital has seven times the impact on productivity than non-ICT capital in nations with lower levels of ICT usage and around three times more in other nations. ICT leads to jobs growth. Firms in lowand middle-income countries that use more ICT have faster sales and jobs growth as well as higher productivity growth. Most telling of all is that, of all telecommunications infrastructures, broadband has the highest impact on economic growth. Where does that leave us? Where is Australia standing today? We are in the bottom half of the OECD countries in terms of broadband takeup. We are paying more for broadband than most OECD countries. We are 35th for quality of competition in internet service provision. We have to do better. What is the option? The option is to do nothing, according to the opposition. It is a do nothing option. We have not seen any other constructive analysis or constructive plans from the opposition about what they would do to remedy this. I will address at this point the fact that the member for Wentworth talks about the amount of investment. Let us look at the amount of investment in a few comparative telco infrastructure developments in Australia. The estimated cost to the public purse in today's dollars of the 1870 Overland Telegraph is $0.9 billion. What does that equate to? It actually equates to $5,365 per person. In 1950, the customer access network, the CAN, was built. The estimated cost today of that is $10 billion. The estimated cost per head of population in today's figures is $1,222. In 2010 the estimated cost to the public purse of the NBN in today's dollars is $27 billion. That is the public contribution. With an Australian population of 22.4 million, guess what it comes out as? The estimated cost per head of population is actually the lowest-$1,204 per perof son. So how anyone can come in here and say that this is the biggest expenditure and yet we are not going to get a return on it, simply defies belief. What has been so disappointing in this debate is the campaign of uninformed armchair commentary that we have had about this. No answers and limited analysis. I will point out this: I went to the Liberal Party website today to see whether they had any plan, just to see whether they were going to come out with something new this week in their debate. But no, we still have the same policy-the coalition will cancel the NBN regardless of what happens in any cost-benefit analysis, regardless of what happens with any study. These people will oppose it. It simply will not happen under these people. This is not about transparency. The opposition has no right to come in here and take the high moral ground. I think it is the ultimate insult to the Australian people, and to future Australians who are going to read these proceedings and write theses on this issue, that this debate about the most significant infrastructure project in Australia's history has been so lacking and so fixated on 12 megabits per second. The commentary is so fixated on people being asked whether they want faster email or faster YouTube downloads. During the break there was a significant announcement on e-health about technologies and how this government is going to be utilising the NBN to drive the treatment of diseases in people's homes. They are actually going to be able to deliver health services that simply cannot be delivered any other way. Does this appear on anyone's radar here? No, it does not. I also ask those opposite this: how much have they been speaking and listening to young people in their electorates? Well, during the break I did, and I will give one example. I went to St Joseph's Primary School in Schofields during the break. I went and talked to years 5 and 6. They asked me about the NBN more than any other series of questions. They asked when they were going to get it at home, because they know that Riverstone is the site of the first rollout. They full of questions about download speeds and how much better it is going to be when they get the NBN. I even had someone ask a question on net neutrality, which is one of the most complex regulatory issues that every regulator in the world is dealing with. I was asked about net neutrality by these young people. Mr Fletcher interjecting",38
21,Ms ROWLAND,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"Now if the member for Bradfield does not listen to young people, that is fine, but I have been listening to these people and I can go back to my electorate and look these people in the eye and say: ‘Yes, I do want to get this delivered for you. Yes, I do believe that you have a right to have the highest quality broadband services.' I will also point out the importance of broadband for inclusion and the importance of broadband, through a ubiquitous network such as the NBN, for people with a disability. I quote Kip Meek of the Broadband Stakeholder Group in the UK-and anyone who has met Kip Meek would know of his intelligence in this area-who says that next generation broadband would improve the potential for videocommunication to compensate for reduced mobility and enhance communication for those who are deaf or hard of hearing by providing facial cues and sign language which require high definition and high frame rates. These are things which can only be delivered through a ubiquitous fibre broadband network. For those opposite who think that wireless is the solution, I say it is Physics 101 that nothing is faster than the speed of light and the only thing that is going to carry that is a fibre network. Wireless networks, by contrast, are shared resources with shared spectrum. You will never be able to deliver through wireless the benefits that you will be able to deliver through the NBN. To those who come here and say were that this is about transparency and holding the government to account, I say it is not about that at all. If you support jobs, if you support productivity and if you support a 21st century solution for problems that will not go away, then you will reject this bill and let the NBN proceed.",40
22,Mr HARTSUYKER,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010. It is necessary for the coalition to introduce this private member's bill because the government is refusing to subject the National Broadband Network project to independent scrutiny and parliamentary oversight. One would have to ask the members opposite why they fear scrutiny so much. If this project is going to stand up they should be welcoming scrutiny and they should be welcoming oversight but, in fact, we get the members opposite carping about the technological benefits without reference to the actual cost and the return that would be made. It was interesting to see the member for Greenway talking about the required contribution by the government and the presumed contribution that was going to be made by the private sector. That certainly anticipates that there will be substantial revenues generated sufficiently to warrant private sector investment. Well, let me tell you that the private sector is not going to invest unless the project stacks up. If I were a major private sector investor, I would want to have the comfort of a Productivity Commission inquiry, of a proper analysis of the revenues that this project would deliver and the risks that it would subject my investment to. But this government rejects that notion. The legislation is not an attempt to delay the NBN. Faster and more reliable broadband has the support of both sides of parliament. It is clear in my electorate and others across regional Australia that better broadband services are needed to improve investment and to lower the digital divide between cities and regional areas. This bill is an tempt by the coalition to ensure that the scheme is financially accountable and targeted to those areas desperately in need of improved broadband. In its first term, the Rudd-Gillard government wasted record amounts of taxpayers' money. For the home insulation debacle and the BER scheme they have a gold medal in waste and we want to ensure that they do not go for a further gold medal in relation to the NBN project. These programs followed a common theme. They were rushed through without scrutiny and without ongoing oversight of spending. The recent Australian National Audit Office report into the home insulation scheme issued a warning about how this government spends money and certainly cast very great aspersions on the government's ability to manage programs. It is vitally important that the NBN program be appropriately managed. But the Rudd-Gillard government has form in mismanagement and has form in waste. Despite the project's budget and despite the importance of broadband services, the government is refusing to release a business plan, is refusing to do a cost-benefit analysis and is refusing to allow parliamentary scrutiny. In fact, the government has expressly sought to avoid any inquiries into the NBN through the Public Works Committee. Through regulations registered in July, no aspect of the NBN can come before this committee. The explanatory memorandum to those regulations suggests that an inquiry would place NBN Co. at a competitive disadvantage because its plans would be publicly scrutinised. This excuse is nothing more than a smokescreen. NBN Co. is constructing a wholesale monopoly and is systematically removing any competitive threats. There are no competition reasons preventing the government from conducting the NBN rollout transparently and with full scrutiny. In contrast, competition in the industry at- would benefit from more details of the NBN to ensure regulatory certainty on the telecommunications playing field. The only possible reason for avoiding scrutiny must be, quite clearly, that Labor has something to hide. Perhaps this is why the government is removing potential competition to the NBN, because it knows that the business plan is unviable in a competitive environment. The OECD reported yesterday, in their economic surveys of Australia, that ‘such a monopolistic incumbent'-that is, NBN Co -‘could forestall the development of, as yet unknown, superior technological alternatives'. The report went on to say that, given the cost and impact on competition, ‘additional efforts for rigour and transparency would be welcome'. That is the OECD being very concerned about the restrictions that this government is placing on competition in the market. We know that competition will be a major driver of lower prices and improved services, not the creation of a protected government monopoly delivered at great cost to the taxpayer with benefits yet to be determined.

23,Mr NEUMANN,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"Blair) (11.21 am)Today I speak against the coalition's proposal, the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010. I have here a map of the member for Wentworth's electorate showing that so many of the people who live in his electorate live within two kilometres of an exchange. I also have here a map of central Ipswich. Its people cannot get access to the kind of broadband we need. I represent the rural and regional parts of Ipswich as well as the area of Somerset, and I know that is why we need the National Broadband Network. Before the 2007 election I got Geoscience Australia to provide me with a map which showed the consequences of the failure of the coalition with respect to the broadband plans they took to the 2007 election. Great swathes of my electorate were not covered by their proposals; yet here, with Labor's proposal in Springfield Lakes in my electorate-and of course in the member for Oxley's electorate-we will see the National Broadband Network rolled out into that area next year. But some country towns in my electorate would not get coverage under the opposition's proposals-places like Coominya, Fernvale, Esk, Toogoolawah, Kilcoy, Lowood. They had 19 failed plans-not interested in the National Broadband Network, always opposed to it. This bill and the member for Wentworth's other motion in the last couple of weeks are all about his own relevance. He is here to do a job on the National Broadband Network-always opposed to it; that is what this is about. Yet in those country towns and in Ipswich in my electorate, small businesses, farmers, schoolkids and those people that need and deserve a broadband network will get it. The coalition has always been opposed to it. We had the member for Cowper saying, ‘We're not trying to delay it.' It is just sense. They are opposed to it. It is in their DNA. It is almost like their opposition to our fair work reforms and trade union. It is like Work Choices. Their opposition to the National Broadband Network is in their DNA. I cannot understand why they are so opposed to it. We are talking about 25,000 jobs. We are talking about my electorate and electorates across the country being covered by the kind of fibre-to-the-premises that we need. We know we are lagging behind. Those people who have got broadband pay too much for it. Not enough people have coverage. It is too slow. Go to Korea. Go to places like that. You will see how fast the downloads are and how broad the coverage is. Yet in our country, one of the richest countries in the world, the coalition in this place is rolling out what they knew very well was a failed policy of $6.3 billion. They know this is all about politics. This is not about economic development productivity. This is not about helping regional and rural Australia. This is about making the member for Wentworth relevant. This is about the coalition posing, preening and posturing to help small business. This is about their facade of economic responsibility when in fact they have been economically irresponsible. They parade themselves as the bastions and supporters of small business when they know very well that small businesses will benefit greatly from the National Broadband Network. What about e-health? Their policy was to scrap e-health. E-health is so integrated with the National Broadband Network and so vital for regional and rural South-East Queensland and across the country, yet the coalition comes in here and opposes it. Paul Heymans is a businessman in the Somerset region. He has made it very non- clear-and so have all the councils-in an article he wrote in the Somerset newspaper about why the Somerset region, my electorate, needs a national broadband network. The catchment is simply so important. The local economy and small businesses simply need to be able to compete nationally. Whether you are living in Toogoolawah or Toorak, you need the National Broadband Network because it is vital in helping you to compete. We have got all the councils: the Lockyer Valley Regional Council and the Scenic Rim Council in the electorate of Wright, the Ipswich City Council, and the Somerset Regional Council-all in South-East Queensland-urging the National Broadband Network into their area; demanding we bring it in, yet the coalition simply opposes it. This not about looking for better costings and value for money; this is about opposition for opposition's sake. (Time expired)",41
24,Mrs GASH,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"Gilmore) (11.26 am)Firstly, I would like to commend my colleague the member for Wentworth for his determination in bringing the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 before the House. The NBN, even from its inception, which I suspect was first scribbled on the back of a serviette as a big ticket item for Labor's 2007 election campaign, has a paucity of detail. For three years, this government and its minister have nailed the lid shut on a project that is said will cost the Australian taxpayer ity of $43 billion and take a decade to implement. So far all we have is no more than a mud map. This bill seeks to unlock the book on what started off as a proposition in 2007 that would only cost $4.7 billion. Is NBN destined to go down the same path as the pink batts fiasco, the gross overspending on school halls and libraries, cleverly yet misleadingly described as Building the Education Revolution or BER? Peter Reuhl, writing in the Financial Review on Remembrance Day, said this of the BER: The BER has been one of those dogs that just won't hunt but still needs to be fed. Will the NBN add to the pack? The cost of the NBN is equivalent to half the debt they generated when previously in government. That is one concern. Of greater concern is allowing this government to exploit their role to create a monopoly which they will be in control of. While this government, straightfaced, rails against the oligopoly of the big four banks and the need for greater competition, they are working hard to create their very own monopoly-a monopoly that will control one of the most vital arteries in the is nation's communication network. Yet Labor, in their campaign manifesto, published in March 2007, which they took to the people, and got elected on the strength of their promises, said this-and I quote directly from the policy document: A Rudd Labor Government will; Partner with the private sector to deliver the national broad band network over 5 years. Undertake a competitive assessment of proposals from the private sector to build the network Ensure competition in the sector through an open access network that provides equivalence of access charges and scope for access seekers to differentiate their product offerings Put in place regulatory reforms to ensure certainty in the vicin- for investment; and Make public equity investment of up to $4.7 billion. The document goes on to say: … this commitment will be financed from existing government investment in communications, including the $2 billion Communications Fund and through the Future Fund's 17% share in Telstra, which will earn dividends and be sold down to normal market level after November 2008. What started off as a ‘you beaut' idea, the best thing since sliced bread, is now being marketed as something that may turn out to be considerably less than what was first described. The first revelation that greeted us was that not everyone is going to get it. Any community with less than 1,000 is disqualified. That is a real concern to me because, when that little snippet was revealed, I found Gilmore had about 22 little towns and villages that would be left behind. The latest revelation is that rather than being free, the NBN is going to cost each household that gets it somewhere between several hundred and several thousand dollars per household. They have also refused to refer the NBN to their own, newly created specialist infrastructure agency, Infrastructure Australia. The biggest infrastructure investment in our nation's history is not being scrutinized by this body. Why is that? The Governor General signed a decree that exempted the NBN from being overseen by the Public Works Committee. Why is that? Residents, organisations and businesses alike want a fast, reliable and competitive broadband service. While I am happy for the 74 per cent of homes in Kiama Downs and Minnamurra in the electorate of Gilmore to be among the first to be signed up to the National Broadband Network, there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered. As a start point, how much is it going to cost each household? By comparison, broadband upgrade in America will cost the government $7 billion. Why does our scheme have to cost so much more? In Tasmania, where the government's NBN scheme was trialled, there has been a low take-up rate. NBN's response to the Tasmanian experience was that NBN advocated compulsory connection, whether the consumer wanted it or not, and forced people to pay for a product they did not want or did not need. Yesterday's Sun Herald reported that three towns in Tasmania had a take-up rate of only 11 per cent. Mike Quigley, CEO of NBN Co., claimed in Senate estimates that the rollout of the NBN in Tasmania was on time and on budget. Yet, when quizzed what the cost had been, Quigley would not reveal any facts. The transition of this bill will allow the whole NBN proposal to be analysed and dissected-factually, objectively, openly and honestly. Let it be said on the record that I welcome the coalition's push to have a joint standing committee oversee the rollout of the NBN and would certainly put my hand up to be a part of it. I remind the House again that this government does not have a good track record when it comes to developing good policy or rolling it out. The coalition will not delay the construction of the NBN but simply seeks to ensure this enormous endeavour is carried out with the rigorous analysis it deserves. I commend the bill to the House.",43
25,Ms BIRD,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"I do not support the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010. I notice my colleague the member for Gilmore says that something factual and logical in this debate would progress the issue. I welcome that from the other side for once. The argument in this bill is all about a cost benefit analysis. We know full well the context in which this legislation is being put forward: that the member for Wentworth's riding instructions on taking on his shadow portfolio were ‘go out and destroy the NBN'. That is the context within which this bill sits. The reality is that in some seats, as my colleague indicated before, we are constantly contacted by people frustrated and annoyed because they cannot get access to broadband. The fact is that those opposite when in government had 18 attempts to get this right and they failed. I profoundly believe that the ubiquitous rollout of fibre across the nation is the most effective way to go and competition between service providers to provide access to that is the most effective way to go. One of the reasons I believe this is due to the fact that I had a trip to Silicon Valley with a parliamentary committee last year and we met with people at Cisco and Google, and the message we got at that time was that this was definitely the way to go. Why? Because the experience in America with competition on the infrastructure side of the rollout of broadband was that it became a dog's breakfast. Companies would provide infrastructure in particular areas and it would not be compatible with infrastructure in other areas. What was supposed to be competition on the retail side to provide services was being limof ited because whoever put in your infrastructure had designed it in such a way that you had to use their retail services. In time, people will look back at this debate-and I think people like the member for Wentworth know this-and say: ‘What on earth were they thinking? How short-sighted were they being?' My colleague the member for Greenway outlined the rollout of telegraphic services and telephony services in this country as an example. We would never have seen that happen if the sorts of arguments being put forward now by those opposite had been made at the time. We would all be sitting here without a telephone, without the capacity to telegraph each other, if the short-sighted views on the rollout of transformative infrastructure of those opposite had been in place at that point in time. times we have to look to the future in a significant way and we have to do it in a way that allows a role for government in laying down the foundations for transformative infrastructure. That is what the National Broadband Network is about. Only a couple of weeks ago I spoke in this parliament about a local company in my area-an international stock exchange company that operates from a home based business with offices in both North America and Europe. The gentleman who runs the company had spoken to the local paper about his frustration with existing broadband services. He provided a simple example-a telephone hook-up for all his offices around the world. He had all the offices lined up, everybody was in place for the hook-up-you can imagine the challenge with the different time zones-and he had to upload a document for them all to work off. The line kept cutting out and shutting down, and in the end they abandoned the attempt to have a telephone hook-up. Businesses in Australia that want to connect to world trade know that the rollout a fibre network is critically important. It has the capacity to transform our economies, and no more so than in the regions. In an area like my electorate, one of the biggest challenges is transport infrastructure, partly because we have one of the biggest commuter bases in New South Wales. My colleague from the Central Coast would have a similar story to tell. Approximately 20,000 people a day commute from the Illawarra to Sydney and to Western Sydney for work. A lot of those are back-office jobs-finance jobs and HR jobs. If those people could get secure, fast network access from home, the reality could well be a transformation in the way they work. They could actually work from home two or three days a week. The National Broadband Network has the capacity to transform the way we live. I think the Somemember for Wentworth knows that and this is his cheap option to attack under instruction. (Time expired)",44
26,Mr FLETCHER,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"Today's debate is not, as those opposite would have us believe, about whether an improved broadband infrastructure for Australia is a good thing. Of course an improved broadband infrastructure for Australia is a good thing. Today's debate is precisely about this question: is it a good idea, in advance of committing $43 billion of taxpayers' money, to require a business case which meets normal commercial standards and to require a cost-benefit study to be conducted by the well-respected organisation the Productivity Commission? That is the question before the House, and I want to make three points in the brief time available to me. Firstly, to conduct a cost-benefit study is a manifestly sensible thing that should be done with this regulatory initiative as it should be done with every substantial regulatory initiative. Secondly, it is not true that the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 will involve any slowdown in the building of the National Broadband Network. Thirdly, a circumstance as we have here-where the executive government has manifestly failed to live up to reasonable standards of transparent decision making; where it has manifestly failed to live up to its own standards as to how the case for an enormous project of this kind ought to be made-is surely precisely the kind of instance where the parliament should step into insist on a higher standard of scrutiny. If the new paradigm means anything, it means that these are circumstances in which the parliament should step into require that a cost benefit study be conducted. My first point is that it is widely accepted that a cost-benefit study is a good discipline to undertake before any major regulatory initiative. I quote the Commonwealth government's Best Practice Regulation Handbook, which says: The Australian Government is committed to the use of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) to assess regulatory proposals to encourage making. The second point I make is that this is not about delay. Let us be clear. To date, 4,000 premises have been passed by the network in Tasmania. A further 10,000 will be passed by mid-July next year. These are tiny fractions of the proposed complete network build of 10 million premises, and on the mainland much less has been done than in Tasmania. So there would be no prospect of this bill materially slowing down the build of the network even if it were the case-as it is not-that this bill in any way required that the build be suspended while the cost-benefit analysis went on. It does not. Simply, this bill is designed to ask: is the way that we are proceeding the most sensible way to build a broadband network? For example, clause 5(2)(b) requires: … a consideration of the different options by which broadband services of particular speeds could be made available to all Australians … andan estimate of the likely time frame and cost of each option; In other words, the outcome of this work will not be a simple yes or no. If it finds, for example, that the present model cannot be justified in terms of the benefits that are delivered for the costs, there may very well be other models which emerge. It is not at all the case that this is about stopping broadband; it is simply about saying, ‘Before we embark on this huge project let's do some standard analysis to see whether the design of it is sensible.' My third point is that this is precisely the kind of circumstance where a new paradigm parliament should step into insist on a higher standard of scrutiny. I quote what the member for Lyne said on 7 September in talking about outcomes from negotiations he and other Independents had held with the better decision Labor Party: That is a good and big outcome from this process, and one that hopefully demonstrates this is not going to be a weak parliament, this is going to be a strong parliament. Those are important sentiments. This should be a strong parliament. Ordinarily when an executive government had manifestly failed to live up to its own standards, to its own stated principles, as to how a project of this scale ought to be carried out there would be nothing this parliament could do. But these are not ordinary times. We do have a parliament which has the capacity to impose the proper discipline on this executive government to require that there be a cost-benefit study before this massive expenditure is committed to, and I commend the bill to the House for that reason.",45
27,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"I rise to oppose the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010. Madam Deputy Speaker, let us be fair dinkum in this debate: the coalition went to the last election saying they opposed an NBN and all their actions since then have been about trying to frame an argument around how they can demolish, how they can knock off, an NBN. They are very much on their own; they are very much isolated in the approach that they have taken. We have just heard from the member for Bradfield that if we went through a Productivity Commission review we might actually come up with another model. That would make No. 19. We would have 19 different models if we had another one come from the coalition. They had 12 years in government and what was their solution? It was, ‘Let's come up with another plan.' Basically, there is another plan every half-year. They say: ‘Let's try to put as many plans as we can in place. That will justify us doing nothing in relation to making sure we have fast broadband in Australia.' The electorate that I represent, Dobell, on the New South Wales Central Coast. It has over 35,000 people who commute to Sydney every day. We have higher unemployment on the Central Coast than in other areas of Australia. The reason people commute to Sydney is that it is where the jobs are, and one of the reasons the jobs are not on the Central Coast is that we do not have access to fast-speed broadband. One commentator on the Central Coast who is very much a friend of the Liberal Party is now actually leading a campaign to see the NBN rolled out on the Central Coast as fast as it possibly can be. Mr Edgar Adams writes for the Central Coast Business Review-not a Labor-friendly magazine by any stretch of the imagination. His analysis of the difference between the parties is quite simple. He said: There is no question that here on the Coast and across the nation the lack of policies and ignorance of the difference between fibre optic and wireless communications cost the Liberals government. He is now leading a campaign to make sure that the Central Coast, like other areas of Australia, gets access through the NBN to fast broadband. The alternative we are given is to try to stop, to delay, to make sure that the NBN does not come about. Not only is it the coalition's policy to oppose the NBN but also they have done everything they possibly can to stand in the way of Australians getting fast access to broadband. It may be all right if you live in the city where you have sufficient broadband access to conduct business, but certainly on the Central Coast-and I know that the member for Robertson, my colleague from the Central Coast, will also speak in this debate-we do not have access to fast broadband and that is affecting our economic development. Businesses avoid coming to the Central Coast because they cannot get broadband access there. The busiis ness park at Tuggerah has slow broadband. The answer is to make sure that we get the NBN in place and operational. In calling for a cost-benefit analysis, the coalition do not come to this argument with clean hands. Where were they in relation to cost-benefit analysis when they were in government? Where were they in relation to the Adelaide-Darwin railway, the privatisation of Telstra or even the OPEL regional broadband plan? Where were their cost-benefit analyses then? The reason they did not do cost-benefit analyses then and the reason they are calling for one now is that their tive is not about a cost-benefit analysis. Their motive is only about delaying and stopping the rollout of the NBN. It was their policy at the last election. They said, ‘We opposed to the NBN.' They remain opposed to the NBN. The bill before parliament at the moment is a stunt, an exercise to make sure they can demolish the NBN and deny people from my region fast access to broadband, economic growth that will flow from broadband and jobs that will flow from broadband. The coalition is trying to strangle the Austraresponsible lian economy and the member for Wentworth should be ashamed that he is using this bill to promote his own self-interests when he knows, better than most, that the National Broadband Network is in Australia's best interests. This bill must be opposed.",47
28,Mrs PRENTICE,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"I speak in support of the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010. It is about time the facts and fiction of broadband and NBN Co. were set out for the Australian people because the NBN Co. proposal is a charade borne out of politics and spin, borne out of a populist government determined to promise whatever it takes to hold on to power-a grand promise produced to generate votes, regardless of the real cost to the Australian people. Fact: Australia will benefit from the sion of high-speed broadband across the nation. Nobody disputes this. We support it on our side of the House. That is the policy objective. Fiction: high-speed broadband can only be produced by an outdated monopoly telco model such as NBN Co. Fact: high-speed broadband can be introduced to Australia's major cities by private enterprise at little or no cost to the taxpayers of Australia. Just look at the current is promo- ject in Brisbane, with high-speed broadband up and down and, importantly, open access. And the Brisbane City Council rollout is at no cost to the ratepayers, but still what was are Minister Conroy's first comment? He wanted ‘to see a cost-benefit analysis'. Fiction: high speed broadband can only be delivered to rural Australia as part of this national monopoly NBN Co. Fact: the NBN Co. model will involve an increased charge on all city users to fund less profitable centres-cross subsidisation. Fact: government should be prepared to subsidise the delivery of high-speed broadband to rural and regional Australia. We have no fear of supporting those great Australians in rural and regional Australia. They deserve it. It is simply a matter of being honest with Australians, not hiding this subsidy in the spin of promoting NBN Co. Fiction: only by exempting NBN Co. from the competition requirements of the Trade Practices Act can it succeed. Fact: successive governments-Liberal and Labor-have acknowledged and supported the importance of encouraging competition. This is plain common sense and almost universally accepted, yet this government wants to take Australia back to the dead hand of government monopoly. It is the Gillard government who are the real Luddites in this debate-building an enormously proviexpensive, outdated telco monopoly model that will lack the flexibility and management capacity to adapt to changing times and changing technologies. They do not care. Their eyes are wilfully closed to sensible market driven alternatives. Why? Because their politics get in the way. This government is in crisis mode. As their promises are broken one by one, sheer obstinate pride prevents them from acknowledging that there are genuine alternatives that will work better and reduce the cost to Australia. This government says to the people of Australia, ‘Trust us,' but their track record of financial disasters, from insulation to the BER, tells the Australian people that there are very good reasons to be very worried-not just alert but alarmed. When this government says ‘Trust us' and there is taxpayers' money involved, the Australian people know that there is something very wrong. The Australian people trusted the Labor government and they have been not just let down but betrayed in every instance-betrayed with waste on a gargantuan scale. And now the Australian people simply ask for, and deserve, some financial transparency. How better to do this than through the Labor government being required to publish a business case for the NBN, to refer the NBN to the Productivity Commission to produce a cost benefit analysis and to see the establishment of a joint select committee to ensure there is at least some parliamentary scrutiny. Given the Gillard government's track record, this is not unreasonable. But this arrogant, dangerously spendthrift, government say no! They have grand plans, with other people's money. That sums up this Labor government. So the coalition brings forward this simple bill. It does so to answer the very real concerns in the Australian community. It does so to address the very real concerns of the ICT community. It seeks sensible assessment of an extraordinary expenditure of $43 billion. If the Gillard Labor government are afraid of this proposal put forward by the member for Wentworth one can only wonder how bad the project must be. This bill provides for an independent review of one of the largest expenditures in our history against a background of real questions about the wisdom of this expenditure. What could be wrong with that?",48
29,Ms ONEILL,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"It occurs to me that getting a bill from the member for Wentworth is something not many people would relish. I can understand why on a number of counts. Nevertheless I am glad to be able to join others today in speaking to this very craftily titled private member's bill-the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010. That sounds like something that would be hard to argue against, doesn't it? How could anyone disagree with financial transparency? I am afraid I do, in this case, because what the member for Wentworth is actually trying to do is to build a straw man out of the NBN. He wants to define the success of the NBN in his own terms, terms that would be quite different to those defined by people who live in regional areas like mine-the people who are the big winners under the National Broadband Network. In his bill, the member for Wentworth says, ‘Give us a business case with a 10-year forecast and give it to us by Friday.' Then he wants the Productivity Commission to do a cost-benefit analysis and publish it by the end of May next year. It is all deceptively simple. Actually, it is simply deceptive. This is a cynical spoiling tactic designed to delay the rollout. Before you know it, the great hope of regional Australia, the great equaliser of opportunity and access, will have gone up in smoke. And gone with it will be the hopes and dreams of hundreds of thousands of regional Australians. James Riley, writing for the iTWire website, has belled the cat. Last month after the member for Wentworth introduced his legislation, James wrote that the member for Wentworth: … is disingenuous-disarmingly disingenuouswhen he says he won't stand in the way of the NBN if it is given a “big tick” by the Productivity Council through a cost-benefit analysis. He will stand in the way because he knows this is a rigged game. And because he opposes the NBN roll-out at the most fundamental philosophical level. Hard-wired into the Turnbull DNA is the rocksolid, unshakeable belief that Government has no business getting directly involved in a broadband roll-out. That the delivery of such infrastructure is best left to the market, to the private sector … I am certain this goes to the heart of the member for Wentworth's problem with the NBN. He is ideologically opposed to the government funding NBN Co. That is despite the abject failure of the coalition's 18 broadband policies, policies which have seen prolonged lack of access for regional customers in seats such as mine of Robertson. Still the member for Wentworth stubbornly clings to his belief that we are better off leaving things to the big end of town. I am certainly not ready to consign Australia to the digital dark ages by abandoning our future to the market. I am not surprised to hear free market fanaticism from the member for Wentworth or from the member for Bradfield, who, I believe, was a high flyer in the telco world before coming to this place. But frankly I expect better from those on the other side who come from regional New South Wales. It shocks me to sit here and listen to the member for Gilmore and the member for Cowper parroting their colleagues' petty quibbles. Why do they not get it? The NBN is the great equaliser. It is the rising tide that floats all the boats, the technological advance that will break down the tyranny of distance for people living in regional Australia. The NBN will finally allow regional Australia to fulfil its promise, to provide services on par to those provided to our metropolitan areas while offering the kind of lifestyle only our regions can. Last week I caught up with one of the NBN's biggest supporters on the Central Coast: the chair of Central Coast Youth Connections, Dave Abrahams. Dave and the publisher of the Central Coast Business Review, Edgar Adams, who my fellow member from the Central Coast, the member for Dobell, has mentioned, are together making a comprehensive business case for the introduction of NBN to our region. I am really looking forward to their first business case event later this month. Surely and relentlessly, we are ready to push ahead. So, what should happen with this bill? I think it is time for some plain speaking. This bill is just a tricky, self-serving bit of argument. It is put forward as a delaying tactic by an opposition that is bereft of vision and is still smarting from the NBN's role in the formation of this Labor government. We know that the Leader of the Opposition gave the member for Wentworth the job of demolishing the NBN. This bill has nothing to do with public interest or financial transparency. It has everything to do with trying to bring down one of this country's most significant pieces of nation-building infrastructure. This opposition has no plan and no policy other than to nitpick and find fault with Labor's nation-building achievements. It does this without pausing for a moment to reflect on its lost decade in office, a decade in which it stunted our productivity growth through a miserly approach to infrastructure. I oppose the bill and encourage others to do the same. (Time expired)",49
30,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"The National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 proposed by the member for Wentworth is eminently sensible. The sense of it is echoed in the voice of the OECD, which in turn is the voice of Treasury. The OECD says very simply that there should be an analysis of the NBN's financial returns, as required under this bill proposed by the member for Wentworth. The OECD says some very important things that are relevant to support of this bill. It says that the government: … should not trigger a weakening of competition in wholesale broadband services to protect the viability of the government project. An alternative to this picking-the-winner strategy would be to let the market guide choices between the various Internet service options on the basis of prices that reflect costs, factoring in externalities that ought first to be evaluated. To that end, it would be sirable to maintain competition between technologies and, within each technology, between Internet service providers. The question is not one of availability of high-speed broadband; it is a question of affordability. An analysis of published figures shows that, of those people earning less than $40,000 a year, only 43 per cent utilise the internet, while for those earning over $120,000 a year, there is 94 per cent utilisation. You can dangle the diamond standard before the people if you wish, but the poor will only be able to look, because they will not be able to afford this very expensive mechanism. By passing this bill and putting its provisions into action, we would see that the government ought not to be creating a new monopoly and picking winners but allowing the market to operate. We would also see that the Productivity Commission has the wherewithal to be able to give guidance on this. This bill is not a delaying tactic; it is an eminently sensible way to proceed and I thoroughly support it. If you look at the terms of reference for the Productivity Commission in the legislation, as outlined by the member for Wentworth, you can see that it includes things that one would think any sensible government would wish to look at. It includes an analysis of the availability of broadband services across Australia and the identification of those suburbs and regions where current services are of a lesser standard or provided at a higher price than the best services available in the city. The Productivity Commission would also consider the take-up rate, the economy wide benefits likely to flow and the different options by which broadband services of particular speed could be made available-all eminently sensible.",50
31,The SPEAKER,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"Order! It being 12 de- noon, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 28 October, on the proposed address-in-reply to the speech of Her Excellency the Governor-GeneralMay it please Your Excellency: We, the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, express our loyalty to the Sovereign, and thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to the Parliamenton motion by Ms ONEILL: That the Address be agreed to.",51
32,The SPEAKER,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for Hughes, I remind the House that this is his first speech. I therefore ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",51
33,Mr CRAIG KELLY,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,"I rise as the 1,077th member of this House, as someone who is proud of his country, proud of its history and proud of its traditions. I also rise as someone who owes a debt of gratitude to past generations of Australians whose sacrifices and struggles have given us the freedoms and opportunities that we enjoy today. I also understand that I have an obligation-in fact, we all have an obligation-to pass this great nation onto our children and grandchildren in better shape and with greater freedoms and opportunities than we inherited. My first duty in this House is to thank electors of Hughes, who have given me the privilege and opportunity of being their representative. I am conscious of the trust they have placed in me and I will not let them down. The electorate of Hughes is named after Billy Hughes, who served as Prime Minister from 1915 to 1923. Billy Hughes had a parliamentary career spanning 58 years, during which he changed parties no less than five times. Having started as a Labor member in 1901 he then, after 44 years, became a Liberal, completing his distinguished career as the member for Bradfield. Billy Hughes's example reminds us that maybe-just maybe-there is still hope for those who sit opposite. But they are always welcome to come across and join us should they see the light. The electorate of Hughes is a snapshot of modern Australia. Right across the electorate, families are paying the price for this government's misguided policies. They are under pressure from surging electricity prices, rising mortgage repayments and some of the developed world's fastest accelerating supermarket prices. Their quality of life is threatened by a mad and dangerous plan to cram over seven million people into Sydney, stacking them pallet-like in high-rise apartments, forcing parents to spend more and more time in gridlock traffic and reducing the time they spend with their families. Hughes is also proud to be home of the defence personnel serving at Holsworthy Army base. Holsworthy has a long and proud tradition and I acknowledge its great contribution to the defence of our nation. A little over one year ago I was not a member of any political party, and I never had been, but I was someone with a fundamental belief in our free enterprise system. I the was just an average Australian, someone working ridiculously long hours in a small family business and trying to do the best for his family. But I became deeply troubled that Labor governments not only had lost their way but had completely lost the plot and at every turn were heading our nation in the wrong direction. I owe my presence here today to the democratic traditions of the Liberal Party, a party that embraces all those who share its values and a party that gives opportunities to those who join later in life. I come to Canberra keen to put almost 30 years of hands-on experience in manufacturing, wholesaling, international trade, retailing and franchising to good use. I am proud to say that in my career in the private sector I won export contracts in over 25 countries throughout the world and this has given me the unique opportunity to travel extensively and to learn from different cultures, including the way they approach business. I was born in Sydney, the eldest of three brothers and one sister. We were all educated at the local state primary school and high school and I would like to pay tribute to the many wonderful and dedicated teachers that I encountered. In winter, our front lawn at home was a football field and, in summer, a cricket pitch, with a garbage bin for a wicket, where I and my brothers and the other kids in the neighbourhood would play until it was too dark to see the ball. But I wonder if today our kids are really any better off when we pack them into housing where they no longer have the room nor the freedom to hit a real ball with a real bat in their own backyard but are restricted to playing simulated impersonal computer games. My father was one of Sir Robert Menzies' ‘forgotten people'-a small business man who grew his business by reason of dealing fairly and justly with his customers, suppliers and employees. He developed his business in the days when one's handshake was one's word and when the term ‘good faith' was just the way business was conducted. I am proud that he is here in the gallery today with my mother Raima, who has always given us unconditional love and support. Sport, especially team sport, is one of our greatest educators. I am thankful that our Australian way of life has provided me with the opportunity to participate in a wide range of team sports, including rugby union. Over the years I have packed my head into many a rugby scrum, although no doubt some would say ‘maybe one scrum too many'. In the early 1980s I had the opportunity to travel to Japan to play rugby and while at Tokyo airport I met a young Chinese student who upon learning that I was from Australia commented: ‘Ah, Australia. You are a wealthy country because you have treasure buried in the ground.' But he was only partly right. The greatest source of our national wealth arises not from the coal seams that stretch down our eastern seaboard, nor from the iron ore deposits in our outback; our greatest source of national wealth arises from the entrepreneurial culture of our individual citizens, our Australian spirit of risk-taking, of ‘having a go'. But today, the very essence of our Australian entrepreneurial culture, the sacred principles of equality of competitive opportunity-that of the freedom and liberty for an individual to start their own business and to succeed or fail on merit, free from predatory and discriminatory practices, rights that our forefathers fought for and died to protect-are under threat from misguided competition policy: a flawed view that ‘big is better'. Over the last few decades, due to government policy, either intentionally or unwittingly, many sectors of our economy formerly open and free to the small business person have degenerated into states of hyperconcentration, of duopoly and oligopoly, through a rising tide of market concentration. Today in our grocery sector just two players control 87 per cent of our nation's full-line supermarkets, and the supermarket duopoly have extended their tentacles further and now control up to 50 per cent of liquor and petrol sales. Our hardware retailing sector is heading in the same direction. This rising tide of concentration in our retail sector has led to further concentration at all levels throughout the production chain. Here are just a few examples. Today, of the milk we drink, more than 80 per cent is processed by just three corporations. Just two corporations brew 90 per cent of our beer. These levels of unprecedented market concentration that currently exist in Australia are more akin to those in former Eastern bloc countries than the free market system foreseen by the father of capitalism, Adam Smith. While we talk of a free market, the reality is that the field of free and open business has become more and more restricted, as anticompetitive price discrimination has become rampant across the nation, destroying competitive opportunity. In America's greatest days, the anticompetitive practice of price discrimination was considered such an evil, so dangerous to the free enterprise system, that it was made a criminal offence. And if our American friends are looking for the reason as to why their economy has gone pearshaped I suggest they need to look no further than their failure to actively enforce their antitrust laws. Under the current legislative settings of competition policy in Australia, we are heading for a future where all the necessities of life will be controlled by a few giant corporations. This is not the future I want to see for my Australia. The friends of duopoly and oligopoly may argue that society operates more efficiently with a top-down, semi-authoritarian control, where vast sections of the economy are controlled in the hands of a few elites. Such an argument is seductively simple for those indoctrinated by theory but light on practical experience, for they do not understand the efficiency paradox. While economies of scale do exist, they have an evil twin: that bureaucratic inefficiencies. When an organisation grows in size, although it may initially benefit from economies of scale, any gains quickly give way to a rising tide of bureaucratic inefficiency. I believe that the greatest efficiency that any market has is that of entrepreneurial effisources ciencies, as shown by small business. This is why I am convinced that as a society we get the most efficient outcomes whenever the decision making process is decentralised and decisions are made by the individuals working closest to the coalface. Therefore, where today we have two entities centrally controlling more than 2,000 retail outlets throughout the nation, I say that we would have a stronger economy, more vibrant local communities and lower prices if instead those 2,000 centrally owned stores were owned by 2,000 local independent business people, all in competition with each other. Over 200 years ago, Adam Smith, the father of free market capitalism, warned us that the public ‘must always be against any narrowing of competition, as it will allow the dealers to levy, for their own benefit, an surd tax upon the rest of their fellow citizens'. One only has to look at what has happened to supermarket prices in Australia to see the result of failing to heed Smith's warning. As the market has degenerated in levels of hyperconcentration, prices in Austhat tralian supermarkets have shockingly risen faster than almost anywhere else in the developed world. But the real danger to our economic prosperity from these levels of hyperconcentration is not just higher consumer prices. What should really concern us is the effect of monopsony, or buyer power. When one or two players control 50 per cent or more of a market, for a supplier to say no to any demand from a buyer with such dominance is to cut of one's throat. So when a market becomes overly concentrated, the so-called ‘invisible hand' of the free market is replaced by the ‘visible fist' of market power, and that is the type of market that many producers in Australia face today, especially our farmers. And this risks destroying the very productive rethat our economy relies upon to generate its wealth. Our banking system provides another example of the risk to our economic prosperity from overly concentrated markets. Our banking system should be the oil that greases the wheel of the free enterprise system, not the other way around. If our banks are now ‘too big to fail' and require government protection and taxpayer support, what sense does it make to allow even greater concentration in our banking sector? The danger of a highly concentrated banking system is not only that Australian consumers pay some of the highest bank fees and charges in the world; the real danger arises from reductions in opportunities for small business to obtain finance. So while the banks gorge themselves on the fees, charges and the excessive margins they ab- charge to small business, they are in fact weakening the very foundations on which our economic prosperity is built. In short, for those who believe the best path to our collective prosperity lies in the free enterprise system, for those who believe in equality of opportunity, for those who believe in the freedom of the individual, strong local communities and strong family values, the rising tide of market concentration is contrary to everything that we hold sacred. I often hear the mantra that small business is the backbone of our economy, but it is not only that. It is also the backbone of our ety and provides an immeasurable element of strength to our nation. To my new friends that sit with me on this side of the House, I say that when push comes to shove, if we as the natural friends of small business do not stand up for a fair go for small business ple, then we risk them remaining the forgotten people. We must never overlook the fact that the free market-or, more accurately, the free enterprise system-does not arise naturally. It is a system, like our democracy, that must be protected by a set of rules and, also like our democracy, one that we must be ever vigilant to protect. There is an unsung group of heroes working across Australia today, what we may well call our neglected people: our carers and children with disabilities. For parents caring for the physically or intellectually disabled child, it is a lifetime's task. For most there are no days off. There is no sick pay. There is no holiday pay. There is no superannuation. And when carers grow old, they do so worrying about what will happen to their child when they are too old or frail to nurse them. Carers may never hear their child say the words: ‘I love you'. So it is little surprise that when parents have a disabled child the statistics show that the chance of marriage breakdown almost triples. Yet as a society we ask our carers to provide over one billion hours of unpaid work a year which, if we the taxpayers had to pick up the tab, would cost well over $30 billion. Simply, as a society we are asking our carers to do more than their fair share of the heavy lifting. To parents out there with a special needs child that believe that politicians do not know what it is like, I want you to know that you have someone who stands on the floor of this parliament that walks in your shoes. My son, Trent, was born 14 years ago with Down socisyndrome and autism. He has no speech. My wife and I will need to care for him our entire lives. I am proud to say that Trent is in the gallery today. I would like to take this opportunity to express my debt of gratitude to all the teachers peo- of our special needs children, such as the teachers at Bates Drive, who have cared for Trent and the other children as they would care for their own. The special experience I have had with Trent has made me a better person. It has made me fully appreciate that each individual has a real value of their own and that the dignity of every individual must be respected. But most importantly it has awakened me to the fact that as a nation we need to do more, much more, for our children with disabilities and their carerssomething that people like Tony Stevens have been fighting for all their lives. We are carers a wealthy and compassionate country. We must find a way, without any of the old excuses, to provide a generous and practical response to the needs of people with severe disabilities and their carers. I pledge that during my time in parliament I will be fighting to ensure that our carers and our children with special needs are provided with the resources they rightly deserve and need. At the end of the day we here in parliament are the spenders of ‘other people's money', and when the government of the day is running a deficit, the ‘other people's money' that we are spending is that of our children and grandchildren. But, regrettably, over the past few years government spending of ‘other people's money' has been characterised by palpable waste. As our recent experience clearly shows, we must always be on guard against a government, a bigspending government, brimming with expensive and grandiose plans to spend our children's money, no matter how wellintentioned those plans may seem. And, as Adam Smith reminds us of such grand government spending plans, they: … ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention. And whether we are spending $1 million or $43,000 million, to engage in the spending of ‘other people's money'-that of our children-on the lick and a promise of a hastily cobbled together plan based on ideology and untested assumptions without a vigorous cost-benefit analysis is a reckless abrogation of our responsibilities. I consider myself an environmentalist. As our cities and roads become more and more congested, I am concerned about the health effects from fine particulate matter in diesel exhaust, as studies in California show that diesel exhaust leads to 9,000 premature deaths annually. That is why I oppose Labor's intermodal freight terminal at Moorebank. In conclusion, we have many other great challenges ahead of us as a nation, including water and food security, national security, immigration, population and housing affordability. If we can get the policy settings right, if we can end the reckless spending and if we can free the hands of our smallbusiness entrepreneurs with effective competition laws, our nation's best days are ahead of us. I believe that no-one could ever stand here without the support of a great team, and I am no exception. Firstly, a big thank you to my loving wife, Vicki. I understand the challenge that you face with having Trent, and I would not be here today without your support. Also, a special thank you to my daughter, Tara. I have seen you grow into a lovely young lady and I am very proud of all your achievements. I promise that over Christmas we will catch up on those 120 hours you need to get your L-plates. To the Hon. Danna Vale, the previous after member for Hughes, I thank you for your support and guidance. You have left me with big shoes to fill. To the rest of my family-my brothers, Philip and Jason, and sister, Tracy-I thank you for your support over the years, and I do feel a tinge of guilt at leaving you with the fort to look after. To Professor Frank Zumbo, the free enterprise system knows no greater friend, and I am proud to have you sitting in the gallery today. I would not be here without your friendship and advice. To Malcolm Ky, you have survived and triumphed through the perils of the killing fields-perils that I cannot even begin to imagine. I am proud to call you my mate, and in this country we do not let our mates down. To Paul Dracakis, Peter Polgar, and my other friends from the Warringah Club, I thank you for your support-as I do to Paul Signorelli. To my campaign team: Chris Hall, Elizabeth Hughes, Simon Newport, Kate Schouten, Jon Childs, Geoff Grasso, Susan Kelly, Steve Iacono, Brett Thomas, Peter Colocino, Kent Johns and Naji Najjar, Gary Law, Coral Slattery, Russel Vickers, Daniel Mcilgorm, Jennifer Hunt, Doroles Gonsalves, Robert Leigo, Aaron Findlay, Magdi Mickail, Matthew Minehan, Jim Daniels, James Parrish, Ben and Rebecca Haack, Ned Marnoun, Paul Blizzard, Pat White, Steve Simpson, Jim and Eileen Gallagher, the Bowen, Busa, Di Mauro and Garland families, and the other 300-plus volunteers that so freely gave up their time to make sure that Hughes remained safely in Liberal hands, I say thank you. I owe you a debt that I will never be able to repay. To Alan Jones, Jason Morrison and Helen Wellings, thank you for giving me a chance to have my say on behalf of small business and consumers. A special thank you goes to Tony Abbott for the tremendous faith and support you have given me throughout. Thanks also goes to the shadow ministers who assisted in Hughes: Julie Bishop, Bruce Billson, Joe Hockey, Scott Morrison, Ian Macfarlane, Sophie Mirabella and Senators Connie Fierravanti-Wells, Marise Payne, and Barnaby Joyce. To Lee Evans, the next member for Heathcote; Melanie Gibbons, the next member for Menai; and Glen Brookes, the next member for East Hills-I say thank you. I look forward to sitting in the gallery of the New South Wales parliament when you all make your maiden speeches. I thank you for the indulgence, Mr Speaker. I stand here ready to serve as part of a united team, determined to follow in our great Westminster tradition-and that is to hold the government of the day to account for poor policy, poor execution and maladministration. It is already self-evident that we will have much work to do. I thank the House.",51
34,Mr FITZGIBBON,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,On indulgence: I believe that was the last first speech. I congratulate all members on their speeches. NA NA BILL 2010 Referred to Main Committee,57
35,Mr FITZGIBBON,FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY,I move: That the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration. Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES) BILL 2010 Report from Education and Employment Committee,57
36,Ms RISHWORTH,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Education and Employment, I present the committee's report entitled Advisory Report on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2010 together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",57
37,Ms RISHWORTH,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"by leave-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Education and Employment, I rise today to present an advisory report on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2010 together with a dissenting report. This is the first bills inquiry to report back to the House under the new arrangements of the new parliament. The bill was one of the first to be referred by the Standing Committee on Selection under the new arrangements giving force to agreements between the government and non-aligned members. The committee was given until the end of the 2011 autumn sittings to report but we compressed the inquiry time frame because this proposal has already been the subject of extensive community and stakeholder consultation, including two inquiries by committees of the Senate. However, the current inquiry provided an additional opportunity for input and the inquiry received 35 submissions. The bill empowers higher education institutions to charge a fee for the provision of student services and amenities, to be capped at $250 and indexed annually. Further, it puts in place a facility whereby students can access a loan to pay the fee and can access improved student representation and advocacy. The importance of reporting back to the House in a timely fashion lies in providing adequate time for each chamber to consider and, if it so determines, pass the bill so higher education institutions might implement these measures in the new academic year. The urgency of providing higher education institutions with the opportunity much needed additional funds was spelt out by the Minister School Education, Early Childhood and Youth in his second reading speech when he noted a $170 million shortfall in funding as a result of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Act 2005. Transition funding has been in place to support essential student services and amenities on regional campuses in the wake of the abolition of compulsory fees. This has now expired. This bill is vital to restoring some of the lost services and amenities to students, particularly those on regional campuses. Every submission received from universities, and the majority of submissions from higher education stakeholders, referred to a decline in student services and amenities on their campuses since the introduction of voluntary student unionism in 2005. Those universities that had managed to maintain student services and amenities did so through redirecting funding away from research and teaching. This model is not sustainable even for larger metropolitan universities which have diverted money away from teaching and research into essential student services. For universities in regional locations, the situation is even more grim. Griffith University, alone, estimated losses of $31.3 million in revenue since 2005. The university projects that without student fees it will need to redirect $10 million a year away from teaching and research to student support services and amenities,. Southern Cross University welcomed the proposed bill to help restore and provide that amenities on regional campuses. This proposal will revive student services and amenities on all campuses, but particularly regional campuses. The revenue raised from the fee will help restore amenities as well as jobs to raise and services lost since 2005. The revenue from the proposed fee will be used to help provide students with a more rounded education experience and a better quality of university life. Universities believe that good student services are vital for the effective participation, retention, and success of a larger and more diverse higher education student cohort. In the long term, these funds will contribute to the ability of the sector to produce graduates who are fit for life with a greater sense of community and active citizenship. This bill has improved since a similar proposal was introduced and passed through the House in 2009. On that occasion the bill was denied a third reading as a result of a tied vote in the Senate. The government reintroduced the bill but it failed to pass the Senate before the end of the 42nd Parliament. The purposes to which revenue raised can be used have been tightened and spelled out in the proposed legislation itself, rather than included as a legislative instrument. The revenue raised will help fund student welfare and support services, helping students to develop academic and study skills and careers, provide child care, provide financial and legal advice, accommodation assistance, personal accident insurance for students, orientation support, library and reading rooms, support for student artistic activities, debating, and student media. These are all very important parts of university life. It will also be used to provide student representation and advocacy services, support clubs and sporting and recreational activities of students, and support international students. A higher education provider may not spend revenue from this measure on any other purpose. They are expressly forbidden from financing any person or organisation that uses the funds to support a political party or a local, state or federal election. the expenditure of funds raised by the fee is restricted to supporting organisations that either service students or are constituted by students. Universities will also need to consult their students on how best to serve them in the administration and implementation of this fee. The Student Services, Amenities, Representation and Advocacy Guidelines will benchmark the minimum services required, but they will also allow flexibility in how to best meet the needs of students on each campus. The committee has recommended that the minister release the updated guidelines as soon as possible. Each higher education provider will, through student consultation, decide what amenities and services will best meet the needs of those students. For example, Southern Cross University plans to consult students in tailoring student amenities and services for those students that come to their regional campuses but also for those students who need to access the university remotely. Some of their remote campuses under the current funding arrangements have had little in the way of student services or amenities and they are certainly looking at addressing that. They have asked for a period of grace in meeting the compliance section of the proposed legislation under the guidelines. They have also requested that a portion of the revenue raised from the fee be able to be accessed to cover the cost of setting up these services. The committee has recommended that the minister consider granting a period of grace to higher education providers in meeting the new compliance rules and that consideration be given to allowing providers to use a portion of the revenue raised to fund the set-up of the administrative requirements that will occur under this legislation. A further issue of concern to the commitAnd tee is the possibility for international students to be charged twice for the same service. In responding to this concern, the committee has reiterated the finding of the Senate inquiry in 2009 that looked at the bill and recommended that the minister encourage the itemisation of international student fees. I would like to take this opportunity to, first of all, thank the minister at the table, the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare, for her work in the last parliament on this bill and also to thank the secretariat for their work in this inquiry. It was a very short inquiry and they worked very hard. In particular, I would like to thank Glenn Worthington and Becky Walker, who has only been in the job a month and was thrown in the deep end but did an absolutely fantastic job working with us. There was overwhelming support for this bill from the major stakeholders, which highlights the importance of this proposed legislation. Universities believe that a wellrounded education better equips students to compete in the workforce and helps them to develop the skills, confidence and support networks that they will need throughout their lives. A well-supported campus is also more likely to encourage retention and engagement, and to raise completion rates. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the bill be passed, and I commend the report to the House.",57
38,Mr RAMSEY,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"by leave-I rise as deputy chair of the committee that prepared this report to the House. It may come as no great surprise to the House that the coalition members elected to oppose this legislation have delivered a dissenting report. As the chair pointed out, it was a new experience for the committee under the new standing rules of the parliament for the legislation to be referred from the Selection Committee for us to review before it was placed before the House. The way it was rushed upon us came as a bit of a surprise. The coalition members believe that this inquiry was held with undue haste and that we have not had an opportunity to examine the full intent of the evidence and, in fact, feel as though some of those people who have contributed evidence were not given the opportunity to deliver the evidence face to face. In particular, I draw your attention, Madam Deputy Speaker, to standing order 143(b), which says that: … a determination may be made by the Selection Committee as provided by standing order 222 to refer a bill to a committee for an advisory report. Then standing order 222(a)(iii) says that: … select bills that the committee regards as controversial or as requiring further consultation or debate for referral to the relevant standing or committee in accordance with standing order 143. The standing orders are not prescriptive, but it would appear to me that the intent is that the committee should undertake some degree of scrutiny of the submissions. Instead, the government used its majority on the committee to effectively guillotine the inquiry. We had seven days to receive submissions. In the end we received 36, but only 29 of those were lodged by closing time. Then we had less than a week to consider those submissions, with no chance to meet in person and no chance to enter into any oneon-one, face-to-face interviews. We believe that there was considerable interest shown in this inquiry, as evidenced by the number of submissions-and we may well have received more had we had more time-and so we decry the lack of process. It would seem that if we are to have any inquiries at all, they should be more diligent than this. To come to the point of the submissions: there were 36 in total, placed predominantly into two groups. The first-the universities and union sector-encompassed 26 submissions, all but one of which supported the bill. I must point out that they were mostly dusted off submissions that had been delivered to the Senate inquiry in 2009. There is nothing particularly wrong with this, but they had an opportunity to present those submissions personally. Tellingly, of the group of 26 from the universities and union sector, almost all stand to gain financially from this legislation. The six submissions in the second group were all opposed to the legislation and they all came from individuals. I point out that these individuals had no opportunity to present in person. Tellingly again, these are the people who will pay the bill. Those who will pay the bill have a completely different attitude to those who will receive the money. That is enough for us in the coalition to at joint least have great concerns whether the student population is indeed in favour of this compulsory levy at all. It is not just a little amount of money. It is anticipated that this new tax will raise $143 million a year from struggling students. It is not just tintacks money; it is a substantial amount of money. In fact, one of the students who contacted us, and I think he spoke for many students who study externally, said, ‘It is not my intention to ever attend the UNE campus in Armidale.' It does make you wonder why on earth this student should be charged a compulsory fee for a service that he will never wish, and is never likely, to access. As he said, he is never even likely to visit the campus. There are many students throughout Australia who are studying under external arrangements and most of them would probably concur with that evidence. We also make the point that the bill sends a message to students that students are incapable of being able to determine what is in their best interests and that it is retrograde, condescending and fundamentally insulting to students that we think we know far better than them how to spend their money. I also refer to the dissenting senators report in 2009, which drew particular attention to the clear Labor Party commitment prior to the 2007 election rejecting a compulsory amenities fee. This policy appears to have changed sometime before the 2010 election. Certainly the Labor Party made no issue of it during the election campaign. Most students in Australian universities at the moment are blissfully unaware of what awaits them next year should this legislation be passed. We also believe that it is highly likely that the funds raised will be used for political campaigns outside the student unions' direct interests and are, in fact, a return to compulsory student unionism. I understand the legislation does have bars on direct contributions to political campaigns, but we would be stretching credibility to think that some of these funds will not be used in campaigns that have a political intent. In the end, we reject the majority view of the committee, and my recommendation to the House is that it rejects the legislation. But I would concur with the chair when she thanked the secretariat-Glenn Worthington and Becky Walker in particular. They were placed under a lot of pressure because of the time constraints, obviously to get all of the material together to convene the meeting, which was held by teleconference, and to deliver the report in what I think is an unrealistic time frame.",60

43,Ms KATE ELLIS,COMMITTEES,Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (12.46 pm)-For the information of honourFirst Reading able members. I present a correction to the explanatory memorandum for the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 4) Bill 2010.,62
44,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,COMMITTEES,"It is a pleasure to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 4) Bill 2010. As with all tax law amendment bills, this bill has a number of schedules, in fact seven schedules in all, that make a variety of changes to the existing law, or clarify the law to correct errors or implement policy decisions. I will briefly run through each of those schedules. The first schedule relates to the goods and services tax, specifically, to amend the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 to ensure third-party payment adjustment provisions operate appropriately where there are third-party payments relating to a supply by a taxpayer that is not taxable or a supply or payment that is goods and services that is GST free, not connected with Australia or subject to a refund under the tourist refund scheme. That was outlined, as were all the other changes within this bill, within the explanatory memorandum. I note that the minister just seconds before the resumption of the debate tabled a correction to the explanatory memorandum. We will have a look at that, not having been provided with it prior to the commencement of the debate. We assume that it is minor in nature. Whenever there is a tax law amendment bill that deals with GST issues it would be remiss of me not to remind those opposite, and indeed in this case the deputy chair, that it is good that the government is ensuring the integrity of the GST. It is a tax that they opposed vigorously back in 1999 and 2000. In fact it is now a little over 11 years and four months since former Prime Minister Mr Rudd declared in this House on 30 June 1999 that that day, because of the GST: … will be recorded as a day of fundamental tice-an injustice which is real, an injustice which is not simply conjured up by the fleeting rhetoric of politicians. With each tax law amendment bill we see the integrity of the GST maintained, and it is good that we do see that. But it would be remiss of me not to point out the hypocrisy of those opposite. Capital gains tax treatment of water entitlements and termination fees is dealt with in schedule 2 of the bill, as the explanatory memorandum points out. This schedule amends the income tax act of 1997 to provide for CGT rollover for taxpayers who replace an entitlement to water with one or more different entitlements, and some transitional measures associated with that. The third schedule deals with two issues within three parts. Those two issues are: amendments to the taxation of financial arrangements provisions-part 1 of schedule 3 amends division 230 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and the consequential transitional provisions inserted by the Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Act 2009 to make minor policy refinements and technical amendments and corrections to the provisions. The second part of schedule 3 extends transitional arrangements relating to the application of the debt equity rules made by the New Business Tax System (Debt and Equity) Act 2001. The other area dealt with in schedule 3 is amendments to the foreign currency gains and losses provisions. As the explanatory memorandum outlines, part 3 of schedule 3 amends the foreign currency gains and losses provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to extend the scope of a number of compliance cost savings measures and to make technical amendments to ensure that the provisions operate as intended. Schedule 4 deals with the issue of script injusfor script alignment and, again, amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to make it easier for takeovers and mergers regulated by the Corporations Act 2001 to qualify for the CGT script for script rollover. In the explanatory memorandum we are told with respect to those first four schedules that the financial cost is nil, unquantifiable or expected to be very minimal indeed. Schedule 5 deals with an increase in the medical expenses tax offset claim threshold, as announced in the budget earlier this year. Essentially this increases the threshold above which a taxpayer may claim the medical expenses tax offset and begins a process of indexation. The financial impact of this is a gain to the budget in 2011-12 of $95 million, rising to $115 million in 2012-13 and $140 million thereafter. Schedule 6 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to update the list of deductible gift recipients. As I indicated at the start, this sort of schedule is quite typical within this kind of legislation. It updates the deductible gift recipient list to include One Laptop per Child Australia Ltd. Other organisations on the list will include the Xanana Vocational Education Trust and the Mary MACKillop Canonisation Gift Fund. Schedule 7 extends gift deductibility to volunteer fire brigades. It adds three new deductible gift recipient categories to the Income Tax Assessment Act. This will widen accessibility of deductible donations to all entities providing volunteer based emergency services, including volunteer fire brigades, as the explanatory memorandum points out. It also extends DGR status to state and territory government bodies that coordinate volunteer fire brigades and SESs. With respect to schedules 6 and 7, there is a small financial impact going forward as a result of adding those organisations to the deductible gift recipient list. The opposition is not opposing the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 4) Bill 2010, which has a number of important measures within it and corrects important areas of law. It is something that needs to be passed through this House. I give notice, though, that later in the debate the shadow Treasurer will be moving an amendment not to any of the seven schedules which I have outlined that the opposition is not opposing but to add a schedule 8 to the bill to deal with some important transparency measures on issues of tax and government expenditure. He will speak next in the debate from our side of the chamber and he will outline the detail of the amendment and the coalition's approach.",63
45,Mr ZAPPIA,COMMITTEES,"I take this opportunity to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 4) Bill 2010. As has already been stated, this bill contains seven schedules, and each schedule relates to a different aspect of tax law. I want to confine my remarks in this debate to schedules 6 and 7 of the bill. Schedule 6 adds the organisation One Laptop per Child to the list of eligible tax deductible gift recipients. The One Laptop per Child organisation was established in 2008 and aims to improve the lives of Indigenous children living in disadvantaged communities in remote and rural Australia by providing them with specially designed laptop computers. Schedule 6 also changes the name of the Clontarf Foundation Inc. to Clontarf Foundation. Clontarf Foundation dates back to the year 2000 and works to improve the health, education and employment and life skills of disadvantaged youth, predominantly Indigenous boys, through a number of Australian Rules football academies in Western Australia and now in other states. Redressing Indigenous disadvantage in Australia has proven to be an extremely difficult goal for governments, both state and federal, over several decades. That, however, should in no way deter our determination to do so. I refer back to the apology given in this House by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on 13 February 2008, where not only did he apologise to the stolen generation but he also outlined much of the disadvantage that is faced by Indigenous people across this country. At that time he committed to providing parliament with an annual statement as to how this government was going to close the gap, as he put it-a strategy that was embarked on by the government to try and redress the disadvantage. I will come back later to some comments he made about the Clontarf Foundation. Access to laptops for young people in remote areas will provide them with access to the rest of the world and the knowledge and opportunities that come with that. In remote areas, having access to the internet is in itself difficult enough. Having access to the kinds of computers that can be taken from one place to another and be used in those remote areas is also critical. That is what is special about this particular program-the computers have been specially designed and will be made available to young people, particularly Indigenous young people, in remote areas. Access to the internet will ensure that they become much more understanding of the world around them and more understanding of the opportunities and the options available to them. If they want to take advantage of those opportunities and options, it will give them access to the educational tools they will require in order to do so. It is fundamental and so important to providing them with the assistance that they need in order to change their life from one of disadvantage to one of advantage. I believe every member in this House has at some stage or another talked about the importance of education and how education is the foundation of enabling a person to live a full and prosperous life. If we want our young people to be better educated, particularly Indigenous people, who are already struggling, then this is one of the programs that we should support, because it goes a long way in doing so. Providing the Clontarf Foundation with tax deduction eligibility will enable the foundation to raise additional revenue, which will in turn be used to provide those computers. However, this particular bill simply puts in place a change of name for this program. It is a program that I endorse and very much support. The government has already invested over $2 billion in the school computer program and has committed $43 billion to the National Broadband Network, which I note was debated in this House again earlier today. Both the school computer program and the broader National Broadband Network are very critical to the future of this nation and for the Indigenous people in disadvantaged areas. For disadvantaged young people in remote and rural Australia, even the investment into the National Broadband Network and the $2 billion plus investment into the school computer program will be of little benefit if they do not have access to a computer that is appropriate for their circumstances. That is the point that I made earlier today. One Laptop per Child Australia was founded in 2008. Since 2008, the organisation has delivered over 1,500 laptops to 20 disadvantaged schools in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland. It hopes to provide up to 20,000 laptops by 2012. The organisation will be in a significantly better position to attract private and corporate donors to raise critical funds to meet its 20,000 laptop objective by being granted deductible gift recipient status. The listing of One Laptop per Child is expected to cost the Australian government $2.4 million. In my view, that is a justifiable and very good use of public funds. The Commonwealth is also already investing $7 million over four years from 2009-10 on improving internet access in Indigenous communities through the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Public Internet Access. I said a moment ago that, when it comes to Indigenous disadvantage, we need to do a lot more to improve educational opportunities for Indigenous young people around the country. In 1995, the percentage of Indigenous young people who completed year 12 was 30.7 per cent. The figure at the moment is 46.5 per cent. It is still only just over half of what the national figure is for nonIndigenous young people in this country. We still have a long way to go. Any program or project that should assist us in getting there should be supported. The Clontarf Foundation has been successful in changing the lives of Indigenous youth by combining their passion and ability to play Australian Rules Football with education, discipline, self-esteem and life skills training programs. The Clontarf program has partnered with schools in Western Australia, Northern Territory and Victoria, establishing over 30 academies across those states. I want to talk a little bit more about the Clontarf Foundation because it links very closely with the closing the gap statement made by the former Prime Minister in 2008 and when he gave his annual response to parliament on 11 February 2010. He said: Overall, the programs have achieved an average attendance rate of 79 per cent, six percentage points above the average rate for all Indigenous students in the schools. So I am pleased to announce today that in 2010 an additional 17 sports academies will commence across Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Victoria. This support about 1,000 students, and will bring the total number of students in the program to some 10,000. Ten of these new academies will be for girls. That was former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in a statement in this House on 11 February 2010. He was talking specifically about the Clontarf Foundation. It is terrific that it now includes women as well as men. It has grown to 34 or 36 academies now around Australia. That highlights that it is working. If the foundation needs to be supported by giving it tax deductibility status, then we should give it that, because it is achieving the desired objectives. The former Prime Minister talked about the attendance rates of the students who participate at those academies being higher than for those students who do not. In other words, linking Australia Rules football training with education works and we should support it. I certainly do. The new academies will be established in Broome, Fitzroy Crossing, Bunbury and North Albany in Western Australia; West Arnhem, Palmerston, Katherine and Alice Springs in the Northern Territory; Mooroopna, Bendigo and Ballarat in Victoria; and Townsville in Queensland. Schedule 7 extends access to tax deductible donations to all volunteer fire brigades. There are more than 6,200 volunteer fire brigades in Australia. Until recently they were all considered public benevolent institutions and therefore eligible for taxation deductibility for donations. Recently the Commissioner of Taxation ruled that most volunteer fire brigades do not strictly meet the public benevolent institutions criteria and therefore would not be eligible for taxation deductibility for donations. The amendment in schedule 7 enables volunteer fire brigades to continue to receive tax deductible donations. All of us in this place know only too well will about the invaluable service provided by our volunteer firefighters. We also know that they can always do with more resources, that they are not-for-profit organisations and that they embark on much of their own fundraising. I suspect that there would be few organisations that most Australians could confidently grant donations to knowing that the money would be used 100 per cent for the benefit of the community. That in itself is important, given some of the concerns that have been raised in recent times about charitable organisations. Funds raised by volunteer fire organisations are used entirely by those organisations and ultimately do benefit the community. As I said a moment ago, all of us in this place would be familiar with their work. I take a moment to acknowledge the work of the two volunteer fire organisations in my own electorate of Makin. I refer to the Tea Tree Gully Country Fire Service and the Salisbury Country Fire Service. The Tea Tree Gully Country Fire Service was established in 1939. It has existed for over 70 years serving that community. Just looking at its last annual report, the service attended 238 community call-outs. Those call-outs would have included things like grass fires, vehicle accidents, car fires, animal rescues, community events and the like-probably the same as that which all similar organisations do around Australia. The Salisbury Country Fire Service was established in 1943-four years later. It attends something like 500 call-outs, on average, every year-again, similar types of call-outs. I am aware that both of those services also participated in fire operations interstate when the demand was there and their colleagues and mates interstate needed support. They both travelled, whether it was to Canberra during the Canberra bushfires or to Victoria last year, to assist with those fires. They are always ready and willing to support communities wherever the need arises. In fact, they would put in thousands of community volunteer hours per year. Organisations like that are deserving of tax deductibility. For that reason again, I support the change, made in these amendments, to enable them to continue to receive deductions for any fundraising efforts that they enter into and therefore any funds that are provided to them as a result of those efforts. Their service to the communities, at both a local and a national level, is invaluable. Once again, I commend the work of the two organisations in my own electorate and, likewise, the work such organisations all do around Australia. I said at the outset that I only wanted to speak about schedules 6 and 7. I have done so. I believe that these amendments simply restore changes to the Income Tax Assessment Act that were intended as a result of other acts of parliament. I commend the bill to the House.",64
46,Mr HOCKEY,COMMITTEES,"My colleague the member for Casey has explained the key provisions of the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 4) Bill 2010, which we are debating today, so I will not go through the details again. Today I want to move an amendment with the insertion of a new schedule 8 providing tax receipts to individual taxpayers. The coalition went to the election with a full suite of policies to further improve our taxation system, and we intend to push for fairer, lower and simpler taxes. One element, which is key, is transparency. Australians work hard to pay their taxes. The coalition knows that every dollar collected in individual income tax is a dollar that a hard working family cannot spend on other things, like housing, food, education and health. Tax reduces the welfare of the taxpayer when it is not put to good use. The coalition believes that it is individuals themselves who make the best decisions on the use of their money. Having said that, Australians will willingly pay their taxes when they believe that the money will be well spent. They know that there is value to the community as a whole in having well-run public services. They know that there are needy people who deserve income support. They are willing to do their bit for the public good. But there is an implicit agreement with the government: taxpayers will say that they are willing to forgo some of their income for the public good, but they want to be assured that their money is being well spent. Taxpayers do not have a good appreciation of where the tax they pay is spent by the government. The information is publicly available in budget papers, but these are not easily accessed and not easily well understood. At budget time we see these pie charts indicating where money is spent, but they are talking in billions of dollars. Billions of dollars is a a lot of money, and people really struggle to understand what it means in the total amount of tax they pay. How much of the $20,000 they may pay in annual income tax is actually going for social welfare? How much is actually going on Medicare? How much is actually going on education? We believe that taxpayers should be better informed. We want to make it easier for people to access this sort of information. The intent of this amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act is to explicitly require the ATO to inform individual taxpayers where their tax paid during the year has been spent and to inform individual taxpayers of the total Commonwealth net debt in aggregate and their individual share. We believe that this greater transparency will improve accountability of government spending and debt. In short, we would be saying, ‘Firstly, thank you for paying this amount of tax'-be it $20,000-‘and, secondly, this is how the government has divided up your $20,000. A certain amount has gone in welfare and so on.' It is not hard to do at all, because it is simply based on proportions. In that regard, the Taxation Office knows exactly how much people pay in income tax in net terms, and I do not think it is a bad thing to thank them for their contribution and then properly inform them of where that money went. The amendment, which we may get the chance to talk about at the consideration in detail stage, gives quite a bit of detail and properly informs individuals of the challenges ahead. It is part of a deal that is so necessary to improve transparency and, at the end of the day, to properly inform Australians of how their tax would be better spent. When we go into consideration in detail I will formally move the motion, but it has been distributed in my name.",67
47,Mrs ELLIOT,COMMITTEES,"In relation to the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 4) Bill 2010 we have had some provisions outlined today. I would like to comment on some of the comments made earlier by the member for Makin, in particular the provisions of the tax laws amendments and the need to have those requirements in place and how important those particular amendments are. Without a doubt, the ones he mentioned and the applicability of those are very important. When we look at tax laws amendments and many that the government have put forward since being in government we have certainly seen some major advances in improving our tax system. We continue to do that by ensuring that we approach issues like economic prosperity and job security for people and by implementing cost-of-living measures. We certainly know how important tax laws amendments are, particularly for everyday Australians. The government have been very committed to ensuring that we have very good tax laws in place. I am happy to speak about many of the actions that the government have taken on tax amendments in terms of cost-of-living improvements for many Australians and about how we have been very committed to ensuring that people can access better cost-of-living initiatives by understanding the pressures that are on many Australians and the situations they face. We made that commitment and we will continue to do so, to ensure that Australians can access better initiatives in relation of-living expenses. I reiterate the outstanding job the government have done since we have been in government. Mr Zappia-We certainly have.",68
48,Mrs ELLIOT,COMMITTEES,We certainly have. I commend the bill to the House.,69
49,Mr KATTER,COMMITTEES,"I rise to speak in the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 4) Bill 2010. The Daily Telegraph features on the front page, as well as on two other pages, articles on ‘Selling the farm'. I am very familiar with the dairy industry. All five of the processors were Australian owned, prior to deregulation. Now only one of the five is Australian owned. I would say that, probably by Christmas-most certainly in the new year-two-thirds, maybe three-quarters, of the Australian sugar industry will be in foreign hands. Prior to deregulation the sugar industry was entirely owned by Australian corporations and Australian farmers. Here we have the sale of a large number of water rights-‘Murray-Darling water licences sold in 2008-09; $55 million worth of water rights are being sold'-in other words, Australian farmland on a massive scale is being sold as we talk at present. Forty per cent, arguably over 50 per cent, of our meat-processing industry was entirely Australian owned until about 20 years ago. It amazes me that very few people in this parliament seem to appreciate that we actually have a trade surplus, which is quite remarkable because we have hardly ever had a trade surplus in the last 20 or 30 years since Mr Keating started this ridiculous marketism, which is fine if someone else in the world is doing it. But since nobody else is, it is the act of an imbecile. It was undertaken by the Keating government and then carried on by the Liberal-National Party government and is, again, being continued on by the curto their costrent ALP government. With respect to the burning question of minerals, all six of our major mining companies-and I personally come out of the mining industry, not out of the cattle industrywere Australian owned: Normandy, North, BHP, Western Mining Corporation and Mount Isa Mines. Now they are all foreign owned. They account for about 80 per cent of Australia's entire mineral production.",69
50,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Can I just ask the member for Kennedy to hold for a moment; I have waited a few minutes. Can you help me out by indicating how this links to the tax bill before the House.,69
51,Mr KATTER,COMMITTEES,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Today it is being made easier for people to sell their water rights in the main to the government. But one of the catchy pieces in this bill-and the minister can clarify it-is that it also makes it easier for foreign people to take that water. The most important aspect of this is that if the government buys-as it intends to and as the opposition intend to, if they go in there-15 per cent of Australia's agricultural production, but four or five farms close down, as happened with our dairy factory, then the dairy factory will no longer be viable. There is not enough rice going through the rice factory, there is not enough cotton going through the cotton gin and there is not enough beef going through the meat works to keep it open. So they close down. Then your cost structures become much higher because you have to send the product a lot further away because your local sugar mill has closed down. The facilitating of the sale of the Murray-Darling water rights is further fuelling this movement. Farmers are going broke and they have no alternative but to sell. They do not want to sell, but they are watching five and six generations of their families going up in smoke. If you cannot make a quid you have to sell. That goes for water rights or anything else. What we are saying to you is: you do not realise that when you make these decisions you are putting another nail in the coffin of your country. We will just be a land of serfs working for foreign landlords. If the labour market is again deregulated we will be increasingly working for nothing. If you cannot see that your dairy industry-the biggest of your agricultural industries-is now foreign owned, if you cannot see that your 15th biggest export item, sugar, is now foreign owned, that 66 per cent of your entire nation's earnings are coming from your mining companies and 80 per cent of that is now foreign owned, and you are still doing nothing about it, and you are leaving Woolworths and Coles out there to screw the farmers down further, then they will sell off more and more and more. It will not only be their water licences but they will be selling their land and anything else that they can sell. This is the farming sector as well as other sectors of our economy. Today I will, once again, be a minority of one, or two or three, but people in latter years will say, ‘Wasn'the right?' and ‘Who sat in this parliament and let the entire nation be sold off? Who did it?' Did galahs out in Gunnedah do it; did they? Mr Zappia interjecting",69
52,Mr KATTER,COMMITTEES,"You are doing it and you are most certainly continuing on exactly the same as your predecessors. Do you want to take any bets on whether the sugar applications for sale will be knocked back? Do you want to take a bet for a thousand bucks down on the table tomorrow? I would willingly part with it if I knew I could retain ownership in Australia of these assets. To some degree you cannot maintain an asset if it is going broke. I have said again, again and again in this place that it is impossible for our farmers. They have to sell their water rights because they cannot make any money out of farming. Why can't they? Because the only country without subsidies or tariffs in agriculture is Australia. Get your latest OECD report out-39 per cent OECD subsidy tariff level-and the subsidy tariff level in Australia is four per cent. If you think our farmers can run a 100-metre race and give their competitors a 30-metre start you do not know much about farming or any other damn thing in the competitive and economic world that is out there. I most certainly feel very, very strongly in opposition to this bill. If the House does not divide in the vote on this bill I would like my opposition to be registered on it because I see it as another nail in the coffin of agriculture in Australia. Not only has this parliament sat idly by and watched this nation's great assets, which were built up by our forebears, being flogged off overseas but they have watched agriculture sink to a point where within five years the nation will not be able to feed itself. Isn't that something to be proud of as a nation-that we cannot even feed ourselves! I disagreed with the report last week that said that that is the situation now. I do not think it is. But within five years there is absolutely no doubt that it will be. That is what we have fallen to in Australia. I have not done the figures recently and I do not know if the figures are available. Within two years of the dairy industry deregulation, arguably three years, this nation went to a farmer committing suicide every four days in this country. This is something for this parliament to be proud of! I am not. I am ashamed to have my name associated with this parliament over a period of 16 years. We sold off the farm. We sold off our mining industry. We closed down our manufacturing industry. We have oppressed our farmers to a point where one of them decided that it was better not to live in this world at all. The Australia that you have created is such a horrific place for farmers that one of them thought that he would be better out of it, and he exited in the most terrible way possible. I conclude by saying that we are burying so many now in North Queensland. As the coffin is going down we play that magnificent and beautiful song written by our northern son, Graeme Connors. The song, which was sung at the Opera House to commemorate 200 years of Australia, is Let the cane fields burn and says: Well let the cane fields burn Let the flames rise Let the politicians and the bankers in the city look up In wonder at the glow in the skies Let the cane fields burnas the bloke incinerates himself in the middle of his cane fields. I know two people who have done that. Mr BRADBURY Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (1.28 pm)-I move: That the debate be adjourned.",70
53,Mr HOCKEY,COMMITTEES,"I am happy to debate what will be adjourned. This legislation has been on the Notice Paper for some period of time. We flagged in the election campaign that we wanted to have a receipt sent to taxpayers so that they would properly be informed, firstly, of how much tax they had paid, secondly, where that money had been allocated for particular purposes, such as health, or education or social security and so on and, thirdly, the amount of net debt that they as an individual taxpayer may be obliged to repay. From our perspective it is all well and good to talk about transparency and accountability, but the two times we tried to have transparency and accountability in relation to the taxation system of Australia the Labor Party sought to close us down. The first time was when we sought the release of documentation on the Henry tax review. We flagged clearly during the election campaign that we wanted to see the release of all the information. The Secretary of the Treasury sought legal advice that said that this chamber did not have the power to order the release of information-a Solicitor-General opinion that is questionable at best but obviously bought the interests of some of the Independents, and they chose on that occasion to oppose letting the sunlight in. We are not talking about letting the sunlight in on over $300 billion of revenue; we are talking about letting the sunlight in for individuals whether they pay $10,000, $20,000 or $30, 000, or whatever the case may be, of income tax a year. They have a right to know exactly to the dollar on a proportional basis how much tax they pay and where that tax goes-it is limited to personal (Lindsay- income tax, I accept that. It is based on an allocation of the proportional nature of government expenditure as against income tax itself. It obviously does not take into account other taxes. But it is not about the total tax revenue; it is about where the money is spent. It is all well and good for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury to seek to adjourn a debate on a bill that has been sitting on the Notice Paper. This Labor Party says it wants to get on with the job of governing. For crying out loud, here is a chance to govern. Here is a chance to send every Australian taxpayer a receipt for the amount of money they pay in tax and explain to them, quite properly, where every dollar of tax will be going on individual programs. Normally, if someone sends you something, you send a thank-you note. Normally, if someone sends you a gift, you send a thank-you. Even though the payment of tax is required, it is a gift by individuals. Look at all the solemn faces of those from the ATO and from Treasury over in the officials' box. I know you all work so hard, but let me say that the tax you administer is indeed a gift from the taxpayers and it is a damn good idea to say individually to taxpayers: ‘Thank you for sending me $20,000 of your hard-earned income. Thank you for working up to half the year-the first six months of a financial year-for the Australian government.' That is roughly where it ends up when people have to pay nearly half their income in tax; they spend the first six months of the year working for the government. A mate of mine has a date in his calendar-some time in December-where he says that from then on he can start working for himself and his family. I call it the ‘for me and my family day'-the day when I start earning money that goes to my family rather than to the Australian government. Kerry Packer said something like: ‘Of course, I'd minimise my tax. Why would I pay more tax than I should? Look at the way the buggers are spending it.' You might remember that, Deputy Speaker, having been in the parliament at that time when Kerry Packer appeared before what would probably have been the communications committee of the House of Representatives. They still occasionally run that footage of Kerry Packer. He was right: why would you give the buggers anymore money than they quite properly deserve? If we are going to let the sunlight in, if are going to have proper processes in this House, why not give every Australian taxpayer a receipt? The receipt would start off, ‘Thank you for paying this much tax this year and, by the way, this is where we sent your tax.' It would cover everything, including the different classes of pensions. I think a lot of Australians want to know that and they could rightly be pleased that a certain amount of their income tax had gone to pay for disability pensions, Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, defence to protect their families or education to help educate their children or someone else's children. I think Australians want to know that, I really do. It is all part of transparency. In particular, it will make people appreciate that when government's spend money, it is taxpayers' money. It does not come from a money tree. I carry around in my wallet a $5 billion banknote issued by the central bank of Zimbabwe, who could teach the Americans, the British and the Europeans a bit about printing money. The Zimbabweans have been doing it for some period of time. What most concerns me is that that banknote is quite a modest sum, that $5 billion. One of my staff has hanging above her desk a $1 trillion banknote. The numbers are so large they are meaningless. People want to know what they are contributing individually. When we talk in this place about billions and trillions, and any variations, Australians say, ‘That is a huge figure'-and it is-‘but it is hard to contextualise given that we have an economy of over $1.3 trillion.' But people know what it means to them. Even today I was given information that suggests that, on average, if you took all bank fees paid in Australia and averaged them out across households, each household pays more than $5,000 in bank fees. This is why this matter should not be adwe journed, because this government have had it on the Notice Paper-and we have flagged it-for some extended period of time. The government have formed a little war council here in the chamber, including the member for Hunter. I feel for the member for Hunter.",71

67,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise today to pay tribute to the local RSLs, local community groups and local schools who participated in Remembrance Day ceremonies in my electorate of Casey last week. As we all know, Remembrance Day and ANZAC Day services are special times to remember all of those who made sacrifices in all of the conflicts in our nation's history. We all know that increasingly large numbers of Australians, particularly young Australians, are participating in these services, which is a wonderful thing. I had the pleasure of attending the Croydon RSL Remembrance Day service in Civic Square, Croydon, last Thursday. I want to pay tribute to the six students who participated in that service. There were four students from Ruskin Park Primary SchoolJames Dall, Stephanie Felsch, Emilee Egan, Alyssa Rushent-and two students from Croydon Secondary College-Danni Cornwell and Jack Shiels. All six students spoke very well, having researched various aspects of Australia's military history. I commend them, their teachers and their schools in this House. (Time expired) Daw Aung San Suu Kyi",74
68,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was delighted to hear on Saturday night that Aung San Suu Kyi appears to have been unconditionally released after spending 15 of the past 21 years under house arrest in Burma. I urge the Burmese regime to uphold her unconditional release. I would be deeply concerned if her future freedom of speech, movement or association is restricted as it has been in the past. I welcome Aung San Suu Kyi's commitment to dialogue and reconciliation in Burma. I hope that a conciliatory approach will inspire legitimate democracy in that country. Her release is an opportunity for Burmese authorities to engage with her and her party, the National League for Democracy. I also call on the Burmese regime to immediately and unconditionally release the more than 2,100 political prisoners held in Burma. As members of this House would know, Aung San Suu Kyi is a remarkable woman. She is an icon of democracy in our region and her resilience is inspiring. She won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize. She used her $1.3 million prize to establish a health and educaby tion trust for the Burmese people. Her sacrifices as a mother, grandmother and wife highlight her unwavering will and commitment to her country and democracy. Flynn Electorate: Regional Communities Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (1.53 pm)-I draw the attention of the House to the effect that fly-in fly-out workforces are having on our regional communities. Towns like Emerald, Moura, Blackwater and Gladstone are being threatened both socially and economically by this practice of large mining companies and their contractors. Last week a meeting in Moura, attended by 230 local residents, put a strong case to the state government to intervene to ensure that the mining companies and their contractors consider the well-being of local communities first and foremost. The recent decision of the Queensland government to allow mining companies in Moranbah to allow 100 per cent of the workforce to be fly-in fly-out is a dangerous precedent. I am not saying that a component of fly-in fly-out workers is not warranted-it is-but workers must have the right to choose. Some have suggested that a 70 per cent fly-in fly-out component mixed with 30 per cent living in the community would at least give these communities a better chance of survival. The current roster system of allowing four days of work, one pyjama day and five days off means that workers will continue to treat regional towns as dormitory suburbs. Moura has 90 homes on the rental market for as little as $150 per week and the town generally lacks the confidence it needs to plan for the future. Indonesia: Natural Disasters",75
69,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The tsunami in the Mentawai Islands in late October and concurrent eruption of Mount Merapi near Yogyakarta remind us all how people anywhere can suddenly be overtaken events of such terrifying magnitude that we can scarcely comprehend them. Indonesians live in a naturally volatile place and their current sufferings follow hard on the Boxing Day tsunami and the earthquakes in Yogyakarta and Padang. Anak Krakatoa, the child of the 1883 cataclysm, has been unusually active, convulsing up to 700 times daily. Merapi volcano is one of the world's most dangerous volcanoes, having been active for 10,000 years. Millions of ordinary people live near these phenomena but must go about their daily business knowing they are powerless to prevent them, relying often only on the prayers of spiritual guides like Mbah Marijan, who was himself killed by the recent eruption on the slopes of Merapi. A member of my staff has studied in Yogyakarta and I know he is concerned for his friends there and in nearby Solo who have been living with uncertainty in a deluge of grey rain and ash. Hundreds of Indonesians have already perished in these events; more than 320,000 people are housed at evacuation centres. We hope they can be spared further tragedy. Australian agencies such as Save the Children and UnitingWorld are working closely with affected communities to provide emergency food, shelter and health services. It is important that Australians continue to be generous in assisting of our closest neighbours in this difficult time. Hume Electorate: Mr Daniel Rumsey",75
70,Mr SCHULTZ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to acknowledge the wonderful achievements of one of the great champions of the Southern Highlands and the Hume electorate. I am pleased to inform the House that in October this year Daniel Rumsey of Bundanoon represented Australia in the 5th Down Syndrome Swimming World Championships in Taiwan. Daniel won 14 gold medals and, in true champion style, broke 13 world records during the meet. With the assistance of his father John, his mother Sue and his brother Andrew, together with a great coaching team from the Picton Swimming Club, Daniel showed his dominance in the pool and was rightly named the male world champion as well as swimmer of the meet. I wish to congratulate Daniel on his tremendous efforts during the meet and acknowledge his dedication and commitment to achieving his dream. He has been duly and rightly rewarded for his efforts and, in the process, has made the people of Hume and Australia extremely proud of his achievements. Daniel is indeed a fine example of an individual rising above adversity to achieve. Bass Electorate: Mr Oliver Vogel-Reed",76
71,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to congratulate a very skilled and talented 13-year-old student in my electorate of Bass. His name is Oliver Vogel-Reed. Oliver is a grade 7 student at Riverside High School and his recent second place in the national Future Problem Solving Program International championship at the University of Melbourne against older competitors has earned him a trip, representing Australia, to the Future Problem Solving Program International world championships in the United one States next June. Oliver was inspired by his teacher, Mr Briginshaw, who has coached him. What I find particularly impressive is that Oliver has only been problem solving for about 6 months. The competition involves solving problems that are set in the future, requiring precise structure and excellent analytical skills. Oliver enjoys reading and science, is a member of the local scouts group and enjoys hanging out with his mates and riding his bike and scooter just like any other teenager. Yet his ability to solve complex problems is amazing. His quick thinking and imaginative skills are a major part of assisting Oliver to analyse future problems. And these problems are not your run-of-the-mill questions; they include food issues, poverty and global starvation. Congratulations again to Oliver Vogel-Reed. I would like to wish him well as he represents Australia at the world championships of Future Problem Solving Program International next year. Gilmore Electorate: Ambulance Officers",76
72,Mrs GASH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last week, I was privileged to attend an awards ceremony to honour ambulance officers who attended the tragic crash at East Lynne where three members of one family and one other person lost their lives. The accident occurred on the Princes Highway and involved a petrol tanker and a family sedan. The only survivor was the mother and wife whose life has been forever shattered by the loss of her tire family and by her personal disfigurement. I would like to acknowledge the role and professionalism of the ambulance officers from my electorate who attended and who were presented with the ambulance unit citation for courage: Wayne Dunlop, Wayne Flint, Lachlan MCDonald, Matthew Potter, Peter Tyler, Ben Lynch, Steve Owen, Andrew Ryan and Louise Wareham. They are a credit to their profession and a credit to community that they serve. I am proud and privileged to represent them in parliament. I am sure the House will support me in thanking these fine officers for the bravery and dedication to duty they showed on that day. I am also indebted to Mr Greg Rochford, CEO of the Ambulance Service of New South Wales, for allowing me to participate in saluting these loyal servants of the community.",76

75,Ms GILLARD,DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to make some statements about the release of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma. I am sure many Australians, with a tear in their eye and a lump in their throat, have watched the remarkable vision of Aung San Suu Kyi being greeted by her supporters now that she has been finally freed in Burma. Our thoughts are with this remarkable and courageous woman at this en- time. She has been an amazing and resilient fighter for democracy in Burma, and I am sure every member of the House would want her to feel the sense of congratulation for her achievements, for her resilience, that I believe is shared by the Australian people. Ernest Hemingway famously said that courage was best defined as grace under pressure. If those words are true, then there is no better example of courage than Aung San Suu Kyi. I take the opportunity to inform the House the that I have had our ambassador in Burma give to Aung San Suu Kyi a message from me on behalf of the Australian people. I would like to take the opportunity to read that message: The Australian people and government share a deep and abiding admiration for you. Your steadfast commitment to democracy and to the welfare of the Burmese people is a source of inspiration for Australians. Many here will be happy at the news of your release from house arrest but we are fully conscious that the struggle for true democracy in Burma is not at an end. The Australian people and government fervently hope that you and the Burmese people will one day see realised the democracy and justice for which you have fought so hard. As that message records, this is a time of celebration for Aung San Suu Kyi but it is also a moment to note that so much more needs to be done to achieve freedom and democracy in Burma. There are estimated to be around 2,000 other political prisoners who, like Aung San Suu Kyi, should be returned to freedom and particularly freedom of expression including political expression. We call again on the government of Burma to have free and fair elections to allow the Burmese people the simple right to select their representatives and government, and we call on them to engage in a genuine reconciliation process in Burma.",77
76,Mr ABBOTT,DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI," Mr Speaker, also on indulgence, I echo the comments of the Prime Minister. Obviously this is a great day for Aung San Suu Kyi, but it is a great day for everyone who believes in democracy anywhere in our world. She has been a symbol of the struggle for democracy in her own country and right around the world. Her party won the 1990 elections in Burma but, instead of allowing her party to form a government, the military junta cancelled the elections and imprisoned her. She has remained imprisoned for the best part of the last two decades. In that time she has not seen her children, and she has never seen her grandchildren. Her husband died without the chance of being with his wife. It was an utterly unjustified, completely outrageous act by the Burmese junta which has been rightly condemned all around the world. Again, I join with the Prime Minister. I echo her words. I express the hope on behalf of the coalition that the release of Aung San Suu Kyi is not just a cynical PR exercise but might be the beginning of wider liberalisation and democratisation in Burma.",78
77,Mr ALBANESE,DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI," Mr Speaker, I have been approached by a number of members who would like to participate in this debate, and I am sure that would be the case on both sides of the House. For their benefit, I suggest it would be appropriate for the Selection Committee to consider allocating some private members' business time next Monday, either in the House or in the Main Committee, for consideration of this matter. NA Gillard Government",78
78,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of her statement in June that the government had lost its way, and I ask the Prime Minister when does she expect to find her way by setting out some clear, direct, specific and deliverable policies to stop the tax rises, to stop the cost of living rises and, above all else, to stop the boats?",78
79,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. You have to give the Leader of the Opposition this: once he is told a slogan by a focus group, he never deviates from it-not once, not ever. He is driven by focus groups every day of the week, with his three-word slogans. When he is not driven by focus groups, with his threeword slogans, he is trying to work out how to put the Liberal Party's political interests in front of the national interest. He is trying to find out what he can wreck next. Since the election he has shown all of the political maturity of a two-year-old. It is about time he got over it and actually started contributing to national debates in a responsible way. Whilst the Leader of the Opposition's tantrum continues, on this side of the House we will continue to deliver responsible government. The Leader of the Opposition asked me what that is about, clearly having no idea himself what responsible government could possibly be about, having never acted in a responsible way when he was in government. Let me take this opportunity to explain it to him. It is about a strong economy. It is about giving Australians the benefits and dignity of work. I was very proud last week to see the unemployment statistics and to see that we have created 375,000 jobs. That is something that we celebrate on this side of the House. It is something that we on this side of the House contributed to with our timely economic stimulus package, while the Leader of the Opposition was content to see Australians thrown out of work and thrown out of their homes. We will bring the budget to surplus in 2012-13. We did not follow the Leader of the Opposition down the path of an $11 billion black hole-not for us that irresponsibility. We had our promises properly costed and we will bring the budget to surplus in 2012-13. We are working on measures that will lift the productivity of our economy. Our economy has emerged strong from the global financial crisis but we need continuing reform, investment in skills, investment in infrastrucOppositionture and moves to increase the participation rate so that we can absolutely maximise this opportunity we have now, coming so strongly out of the global financial crisis. We are readying our economy for the challenges of the future: building the National Broadband Network, dealing with pricing carbon and tackling climate change. At the same time, we are governing for all Australians. We do not want Australians left behind because they lack a quality education or quality health services. The reality is that we inherited from the Leader of the Opposition a health system groaning under the weight of his cuts, and we are now preparing it for the future. We inherited an education system presided over by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition where no-one cared about disadvantage and no-one cared about children being left behind, and we are systematically fixing that. At the same time, we continue to make sure that Australia's voice is heard in the councils of the world. We continue to make sure that our nation is safe and strong, and there is no more important engagement in that than the successful prosecution of our mission in Afghanistan. The Leader of the Opposition asked me: ‘What does this government stand for?' We stand for all of that. He stands for wrecking and three-word slogans.",78
80,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. Given the answer she has given, does the Prime Minister agree with former Labor minister Graham Richardson that the government has no agenda and no plan?",79

87,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I say in answer to the question from the Leader of the Opposition: would it not strike Australians as strange that, in a world where there are so many challenges-how do we keep our economy strong and how do we ready our economy for the future? How do we tackle climate change? How do we make sure that every child in this country gets a great quality education and how do we make sure we have the healthcare services that Australians deserve not only today but in 10, 20 and 30 years time as our society ages? How do we make sure that we have worldclass infrastructure right around the country? How do we make sure that we have balanced growth in an economy where our resources sector is obviously going so strong but things like the high dollar are impacting on other industries and other parts of the country? How do we reconcile and improve the prospects and life expectancy of Indigenous Australians; how do we close the gap? How do we as a world deal with the challenges of food security, development and freer trade? In the face of all these challenges, that the Leader of the Opposition would come into this place and use the precious minutes of question time to yet again play politics-we do not expect anything more from a man whose entire philosophy can be reduced to a few three-word slogans. The truth is that the Leader of the Opposition has no plans for the economy and no plans to bring the budget to surplus.  order on direct relevance.

88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has the call and she is responding.,80
89,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not agree with former Prime Minister John Howard about much but he was right about the member for Sturt, you have to give him that. The Leader of the Opposition comes in with this sort of cheap criticism because he is a man with no plan for the economy and no plan to bring the budget to surplus. His only plan for health has been cutbacks. He has never cared less about kids' education-never made a substantive statement on the matter. He has no plan to tackle climate change, just cheap slogans. On every major public policy debate and challenge in this country he has already set his mind to wreck what he can, putting the political interests of the Liberal Party always in front of the national interest, each and every day. G20 Meeting APEC Meeting",80
90,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the outcome of the recent meeting of the G20 summit in Korea and on the recent APEC leaders meeting in Japan? Mr Randall interjecting,80
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I simply say to the member for Canning, as I said to a former colleague from Western Australia: if he wants to be a commentator he can go and sit up beside me, preferably in the soundproof booths. The question was in order. The Prime Minister now has the call to respond to the question.",80
92,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure that, generally, members of the House are interested in the prospects of the global economy and actually understand that what happens in the global economy matters to Australians and matters to their jobs. It would seem to me a great pity indeed that there are members in this parliament who do not care less about that. I have, of course, just returned from the meeting of the G20 in Korea and the meeting of APEC in Japan. These were important events globally and in our region for the future prospects of the Australian economy and for the jobs of Australians. At both meetings, the G20 and APEC, important steps were taken which will matter for Australians as the global economy recovers, even though that recovery is fragile. I was very pleased to see that at the G20, leaders yet again indicated that they would resist a slide into protectionism in what is a difficult period in the global economy-a difficult period for many economies that are experiencing high unemployment rates and sluggish growth and that are going through the painful work of fiscal consolidation. Even in these pressing and difficult circumstances for many economies, leaders were prepared to say that they would hold out against protectionism. Indeed, they went further and said that they wanted to inject a level of ambition into the Doha Round of trade talks and wanted 2011 to be the endgame and to have the Doha Round concluded. I believe this is an important statement from the G20, one that is very much in Australia's national interest. I was also pleased to see that the G20 did deliver on the stronger global financial system through the Basel III rules and stronger international financial institutions, ticularly the long-sought reform of the IMF-something that Australia played a big role in designing through co-chairing the working group with South Africa. Leaders also authorised a framework to consolidate global growth-to lift growth in all economies. We understood at the meeting that that would require the hard work of structural reform and it would require the world to address the imbalances in the current global system with some countries saving too much and some countries spending too much. I was also pleased that this spirit of progress was there in the APEC meeting and in particular that leaders agreed on a free-trade area of the Asia-Pacific-once again a long sought after goal-and that practical work was done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and that President Obama, who will chair APEC next year in America, indicated that he wanted to see real progress on the TransPacific Partnership by the time of that meeting. That is once again a very good development for Australia. We are a great trading nation. This is quintessentially multilateralism that is part of Labor's heritage and Labor's work as we go about our business in the world. We are proud to have been one of the founding nations of APEC. It was a great move by former Prime Minister Bob Hawke. It was a great move by former Prime Minister Keating to lift the meeting to leader level. I was pleased to see that within our region the spirit of free trade and economic liberalism is still very strongly alive and well. This is in Australia's national interest. Trade means jobs. Asylum Seekers",80
93,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the comments by former Labor minister, now citizen, Graham Richardson, about the Prime most par- Minister's failures, and I quote: The announcement of the East Timor detention centre, which the government is clinging to despite it becoming increasingly ridiculous, springs to mind. As the government has clearly lost its way on border protection, will the Prime Minister now abandon her three-word slogan of ‘regional processing centre'?",81
94,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They must have forgotten to have the tactics meeting today. Mr Swan interjecting,81
95,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am being in a more generous spirit than the Treasurer. The Treasurer is probably right-they did have the tactics meeting today, and this is the product of it. Let me explain to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the government is committed to working on a comprehensive plan to address unauthorised arrivals. That is why we are working on a regional protection framework and a regional processing centre. I understand that the opposition thinks that it is smart to wander around with three-word slogans, no policy content, no idea about how these things would come to light and crazy statements like the Leader of the Opposition's statement about boat phones-sitting in Kirribilli issuing orders to patrol boat commanders on the front line about what they should do the next when they see an unauthorised boat. This kind of puerile nonsense we will leave to the opposition, and whilst we leave it to the opposition we will be getting on with the hard work of dealing with these questions of unauthorised arrivals. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is doing that. He has already made comprehensive statements about the circumstances of children in detention. As I am aware, the opposition still cannot work out, given its internal divisions, whether it favour of that or against it, whether what member for Cook says is going to be the same as what the member for Pearce says or whether they will continue to be absolutely different. They still are not able to put any content around what they would do if they were in government on the question of dealing with detention and unauthorised arrivals. They are full of statements but no details. are getting on with the hard work. We will continue to do that. The minister has dealt with the question of children in detention; has dealt with the question of our long-term detention strategy. We are in dialogue with our region about the regional protection framework and regional processing centre. We understand as we go about this hard work that the opposition will play cheap politics. That is what they do. G20 Meeting",81
96,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Following the Prime Minister's trip to the G20 summit last week, will the Prime Minister inform the House of both the Australian and the global outlook for employment?",82
97,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question and thank him for his keen interest in jobs for Australians. As I was attending the G20 and APEC, what was at the forefront of my mind was the question of jobs for Australians. When I was there at those international meetings, the talk between leaders was about the circumstances of employment around the world. Here in Australia, of course, we have proudly created 375,000 jobs. Our unemployment rate is at 5.4 per cent. Our participation rate is going up as more people are seeking to move into our workforce so they too can experience the benefits and dignity of work. When we look around the world, economies are in a very different circumstance. If is in we look at America, for example, unemthe ployment is at more than nine per cent, pressing on so many Americans, pressing on them with the loss of dignity and independence that comes with the loss of work, pressing on them in a really practical way as mortgage foreclosures hit rates like eight per cent as Americans who lose jobs lose their homes. At the same time, governments in We many of these economies with high unemployment and sluggish growth are needing to engage in fiscal consolidation. That means he many cutbacks to services that citizens in those countries have come to rely on, and that is also creating a great deal of pressure for those economies and for the citizens within those economies. At the global meetings, we talked frankly about the pressures on leaders in some of these economies-the pressures for protectionism. Once again I am pleased that those protectionist measures will be resisted. Here in Australia, through economic stimulus, we have worked hard to support Australian jobs and I am proud that we have done so. We have created 375,000 jobs and we look forward to creating more jobs. In order to do that, we do need to be involved with dialogue with our regional partners and more broadly about what needs to be done to keep lifting global growth. I am very pleased indeed that we have agreed on further measures that will facilitate trade. We are a great trading nation and trade equals jobs-jobs for Australians in so many sectors and so many parts of our country. So I thank the member for his question and I also thank the leaders with whom I met at both the G20 and APEC for their determination to keep focusing on global growth, keep focusing on freer trade and keep focusing therefore on jobs here and jobs around the world. Asylum Seekers",82
98,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the 47 boats and 2,362 boat people that have been intercepted offshore since June, when she indicated that the government had lost its way. Given that the East Timor solution is floundering and extra detention centres are being opened and expanded to meet growing demand for places, how is her government showing that it has found a way to protect Australia's borders?",83
99,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question, and it really does have a very simple answer. As a government, we tell people the truth; as an opposition, you engage in spin and slogans. In the spirit of ing people the truth, when I first spoke about this matter as Prime Minister at the Lowy Institute I made it abundantly clear that achieving my vision of a regional protection framework and regional processing centre would take some time. I was very frank with Australians about the sources of unauthorised arrivals. I was very frank with Australians about the number of arrivals. I was very frank with Australians about sharing and understanding their concerns. But I also said to Australians at the time, very clearly, very frankly, that there was no slogan that would fix this problem, that there was no one-word policy that would fix this problem, that it would take patient and methodical work, and we are engaged in that patient and methodical work as a government now, with the work that has been done by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. I understand that the opposition believes it has profited off the cheap politics it has played around the asylum seeker question, just as it sought to profit off this cheap politics when it was in government, causing fundamental divisions amongst its backbench because members like the former member for Kooyong stood up against it. I wait to see members on the back bench today who shared those concerns under the Howard government once again stand up against this cheap politics. Despite current signs, I am actually very confident that they will, because the complete inability of the opposition to deal comprehensively with the question of children in detention of order. The Prime Minister is now ranging over the opposition's policies from past governments and years. She was asked how she is going to find a way to protect Australia's borders since she has been Prime Minister",83
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Oppotellsition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister will relate her response directly to the question.,83
101,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In conclusion, I will say that the opposition, divided on these questions, divided about the question of children in detention, will continue to try to profit off its cheap politics. What we will do is we will continue to patiently work through it, we will continue to deploy more assets to patrol our borders than have ever been deployed before and we will continue to tell Australians the truth about the issue of unauthorised arrivals and about how we are dealing with it. G20 Meeting",83
102,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on the outcomes from the G20 leaders meeting with regard to financial regulation and any implications for Australia?,83
103,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dobell for his very important question, because the G20 endorsed the most comprehensive reforms to the global financial system in decades. These are very important reforms, because we have seen what a global financial crisis can do. It can produce a global recession, and nobody is immune from that. So reforming the international financial system is absolutely essential to prosperity, not just globally but in countries like Australia. What we saw at the height of the global financial crisis was a dramatic impact on our financial system. But fortunately we were able to avoid the worse impacts of that global financial crisis and global recession. What the global financial crisis indicated was the importance of having a stable financial system globally, and the overriding objective of having that globally is so that we can secure jobs so that we avoid the destruction of capital and the destruction of lives that flowed from the global financial crisis and global recession. The G20 endorsed the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision-very important reforms when it comes to capital adequacy for our banks nationally and for banks internationally-and endorsed the work of the Financial Stability Board. Of course, our banks will comply in full with these new international standards, but they will do it in a way which takes into account our unique circumstances, because we did not have the excesses in our banking system that we saw in the United States or that we have seen in Europe. We have certainly had a much more stable system and we have certainly had a better supervisory system in this country. So we did not see the risky behaviours that we have seen overseas. But of course we were not immune and that is why we moved comprehensively and swiftly to put in place our bank guarantees for depositors and the guarantees for wholesale funding. And those guarantees for wholesale funding will bring to the Australian taxpayer $5 billion in revenue over time. The banks have paid for that wholesale funding guarantee, which was so important to the supply of credit to the Australian economy. Of course, there will be some differences in the way in which these rules are implemented in Australia, and this is particularly the case when it comes to liquidity standards. In this country we simply do not have enough government debt to comply with those standards in the way in which they will be implemented in other countries, and the G20 has recognised that and will work with the Australian authorities to ensure that we do comply in a way which does not push up domestic costs. Why do I make that point? Because there will be absolutely no excuse for any Australian bank to force up its costs as a result of these important international rules. So what our work to the G20 has done is bring further stability to our banking system, so important to the prosperity of our country and so important to the peace of mind of anyone in this country who has their money in a bank and is a depositor in a major financial institution. These reforms are absolutely critical to our future prosperity and they have been put in place with the very strong support of the Australian government. Interest Rates",83
104,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the 16 separate occasions on which she and the Treasurer have warned the banks about interest rate rises above the Reserve Bank's increase since the government lost its way in June. I ask the Prime Minister: when will the government find its way by adopting the coalition's policy on price signalling, which will actually help to prevent unjustifiable interest rate increases and actually help to solve the problem?",84
105,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because it enables me to advise him that the member for Dunkley has, in the newspaper today, indicated his grand scepticism about the impact of the shadow Treasurer's plans. So I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that perhaps the first thing he needs to do is call together the motley crew he refers to as his shadow ministry and see if they are able to articulate one position. Because there we have it on the pages of today's Financial Review, and they are all over the place. Now, whilst the Leader of the Opposition spends his time trying to herd his shadow ministerial cats into one position, what we will do is continue to get on with the business of reforming banking to facilitate competition. What the Leader of the Opposition may not know, because we all know he is bored by economics-ask John Hewson, ask Peter Costello; I think it is very he has followed any of these developments-is that the government has already acted to support competition in the banking sector. We acted as the global financial crisis hit to provide financial support in the billions of dollars to residential mortgage backed securities in order to support particularly second-tier lenders and to facilitate competition in the banking market. We have acted as a government to crack down on unfair mortgage exit fees. These are the fees that stop people going to shop around. When people cannot shop around because the exit fee from their current product is so high, that obviously reduces competition. We are seeing, I believe, a change in the policy settings of some banks about mortgage exit fees because of this government action. The government is committed to continuing to act to facilitate competition in banking. We are doing that in a methodical way. The Treasurer has been crystal clear about his intentions to do just that, including in public statements in early October. What we have seen on the opposition side is the shadow Treasurer run out and call for a reregulation of interest rates, and every day since we have seen the shadow Treasurer trying to recover from that statement with increasingly desperate failing around about policy settings, which has drawn sharp criticism in his own shadow cabinet about his economic competence and ability-and actually the Leader of the Opposition on radio refused to back him in when asked. Well, we will leave that disarray for the opposition benches as we get on with the job of facilitating competition in banking. Economy",84
106,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will you please update the House on the economic and fiscal unlikely that outlook for Australia?,85
107,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Braddon for his question. The midyear update showed that the Australian economy continues to be well ahead of the pack. When many of our peers are suffering double-digit unemployment, job creation is strong. We have strong economic growth, forecast to be 3¼ per cent in 2010-11 and 3¾ per cent in 2011-12, but it is the job figures that are particularly important here. Australia has created since November 2007 over 650,000 jobs and in the next 18 months we are looking to the creation of something like 380,000 jobs-almost one million jobs. That is a stunning achievement for the Australian economy, a stunning achievement of the Australian people, and I would have thought that it is something that those on the other side of the House should be applauding. We have falling unemployment-down to 4½ per cent by mid-2012. The other thing we have is a very strong pipeline of investment. Private investment in major projects around his this country continues to be strong and grows stronger almost by the week. Of course, the budget is coming back to surplus in three years-in 2012-13. As the Prime Minister was saying before, not only is that strong but we are delivering the fastest fiscal consolidation seen in this country since the 1960s4½ per cent of GDP, a much quicker return to surplus because of the policies that this government is putting in place to return the budget to surplus. It is returning it to surplus because we have strict spending rules. We are holding real spending growth to two per cent and we are ensuring that every new dollar that is spent is offset. This is disciplined economic management which is producing results. You can see this applauded in the OECD survey today, which points to the fact that the Australian economy is one of the strongest in the developed world. It says that the policies that were put in place during the global crisis in Australia were the most effective in the entire OECD. It goes on to talk about our disciplined fiscal exit strategy. I quote: … limiting government spending rises to 2% per annum over an extended period is a relatively bold objective, especially as spending has on average by over 4% per annum since the early 1970s. That includes during the period that those opposite were in government for 11 years. We are doing something that they could not dare contemplate. We are putting in place strict spending discipline and a range of policies to deal with mining boom mark 2, which are also applauded by the OECD today. What we see from the OECD is a resounding endorsement of the government's economic strategy. What we see from the other side is continual carping, talking the economy down, refusing to recognise what the Australian economy is doing relative to our peers and refusing to recognise the successes of the Australian economy and the Australian workforce and business people.  the question was very short and it basically went to the current fiscal settings. It had nothing to do with the opposition's position or policies. I would ask you to rule what he is saying out of order.",85
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Treasurer will relate his response directly to the question.,86
109,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We will continue to get on with the job of building a stronger economy and putting in place positive policies for the future to support jobs and future prosperity. Banking,86
110,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Treasurer's claim that he has been working on a second wave of banking reforms for some time but that he will not tell us what they are until after the parliament rises in December. Given that no-one knows what the first wave of banking reform was, and given that the government seems to have lost its way on grown banking with the four major banks implementing extraordinary interest rate rises above the RBA, why will the Prime Minister not release now her so-called long standing plan for more banking competition?",86
111,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for North Sydney for his question. Presumably, at some point he will be explaining to the Australian people what he did or, rather, did not do when he was a minister in the Howard government with responsibility for financial services and consumer affairs. What he did not do would be a good explanation for the Australian people to hear, because it is only since he sat on the opposition front bench that he has cared for one minute about these matters. I use the terminology ‘cared for one minute' deliberately, because it was only one minute's consideration he gave until he ran out and blurted out his plan to reregulate interest rates and he has been back-pedalling to cover-up that brain explosion ever since.",86
112,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will return to the question.,87
113,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In contrast, the government is facilitating competition in the banking sector. The member for North Sydney says he is not aware of what the government's banking reforms to date have been. Let me go through them. The government acted to support small lenders by investing $16 billion in the residential mortgage backed securities market. That was done to help small lenders access more affordable funding at a very difficult time, as the world moved into a global economic shock with the global financial crisis. I know that before member for North Sydney had his nine-point plan he had his four-point plan and he was calling for the abolition of this, but this is and has been very important to support small lenders. Then there has been the government's financial claims scheme to protect the deposits of ordinary Australians. Mr Swan-Which you couldn't do in 12 years!",87
114,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney could not do it in 12 years; that is true.,87

117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for North Sydney waits like everybody else for the call at the dispatch box. He will now come to a point of order. Mr Hockey-I rise on a point of order on relevance. I ask the Prime Minister: why will the Prime Minister not release her long standing plan now?,87
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Nearly the full 45 seconds were used with other comments that cannot have been debate because they would have been out of order but they formed part of the question to which a response can be directly relevant. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,87
119,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Continuing to respond to the question I was asked about the government's earlier wave of reforms, that wave of reforms also included the government's financial claims scheme to protect the deposits of ordinary Australians, something that the Howard government failed to do over 12 long years. That earlier wave of reforms included the account-switching package that the the government introduced in 2008 to help customers transfer their financial arrangements across banks. The government has also taken steps to develop a deeper and more liquid corporate bond market. That is going to help businesses to borrow from retail investors and reduce their reliance on borrowing from banks. The RBA introduced reforms in 2009 to make ATM fees more competitive and transparent, and fees such as those for using foreign ATMs have fallen significantly. Then of course there is the government's work on unfair mortgage fees that keep people tied into financial products that they no longer want when they decide to shop around. The government, having delivered these earlier reforms, will build on these reforms in a thoughtful way. I am not surprised that the member for North Sydney does not understand the government's approach, because being thoughtful has never been his strong suit.",87

121,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I will not call the member for La Trobe until the House comes to order. In calling the member for La Trobe, I apologise to her on behalf of the House that she is not getting the respect that she asked in her first speech that we all give each other. Asylum Seekers",87
122,Ms SMYTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Will the minister outline to the House the implications of last week's High Court decision on the processing of asylum seekers? How has this decision been received and what is the government's response?,88
123,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. Last Thursday the High Court delivered its decision on the challenge to refugee processing of offshore arrivals. It is very important to be clear about thiswhat this decision did and did not do. The court has found that the refugee status assessments and independent merits review is subject to judicial review in some circumstances relating to procedural fairness. Importantly, this decision has no impact on the government's capacity to establish a regional processing centre which would be operated as part of an international framework. However, there are doubts and serious questions about whether decisions made by Australian government officials in third country processing would be subject to judicial review where they are not part of an international agreement and where they are not partnered with international organisations. I note that the opposition have sought legal advice on the issue of whether the Nauru solution would be made impractical by the High Court's decision. They got it from their preferred independent and impartial legal adviser, Senator Brandis. I am sure the House will be relieved to know that, after deep consideration in his chambers, Senator Brandis has given the opposition policy a big tick and cleared it on legal advice. But you do not always have to get legal advice from somebody who happens to be the shadow Attorney-General. There are other lawyers in Australia. For example, Julian Burnside QC was asked about this last Thursday. He was asked whether the opposition's policy would stand up. He said, ‘I think there is a respectable",88

125,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will be heard in silence. It amazes me when people are interjecting on their own interjections, because they surely cannot hear the answer. I cannot hear it. The minister has the call. He should be heard in silence. I hope he is heard in silence.",88

128,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is funny how Mr Burnside is apparently less impartial than Lord Brandis of Brisbane, according to those opposite!",88
129,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will ignore the interjections, and interjecting will cease.",88
130,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Burnside said, ‘I think there is a respectable argument that if officers of the Australian Commonwealth operating in Nauru make a life and death decision they also would be subject in the same way to review that the High Court has said today.' It is important when considering implications of the High Court case that we base our policy responses on the consideration of the facts. I noticed on Lateline on Thursday night the member for Cook was asked to respond to my suggestion that the so-called Nauru solution might be caught up in the High Court case. The member for Cook said this: Well, if Chris Bowen's right, then that means the 47,000 applications that were made offshore for protections visas in Australian missions and with Australian officials around the world or the thousands of other applications that are made for skilled visas and others would all be reviewable by the High Court. That is what the member for Cook said: ‘If Chris Bowen's right, this would need to be true.' Guess what? It is true. The honourable member for Cook appears to be unaware that those applications are subject to judicial review by Australian courts. It just goes to show that when it comes to policy it is important to be good at more than sound grabs. It is also important to be good at sound policy, which the honourable member for Cook and his colleagues appear not able to be. The government will continue to work through the implications of the High Court decision in a calm and methodical manner, and the opposition might care to do the same in relation to the High Court implications for their own policy. Emissions Trading Scheme",88
131,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to President Obama's abandonment of a capand-trade emissions trading scheme for the world's largest economy. As the Prime Minister herself rejected an emissions trading scheme during the period of the Rudd government, which she said had lost its way, can she explain how increasing electricity prices for Australian consumers rather than cleaning up power stations is somehow the government finding its way?",89
132,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. As he would be aware if he had followed the commentary in the United States, President Obama has been in favour of a cap-and-trade scheme to price carbon in the American economy and, following the mid-term elections, has accepted that the reality of the congress that he faces is that he will not be able to legislate for it. He is experiencing obstruction in the congress for a proposal that he supports and consequently understands that he will not be able to get a scheme through. One should not interpret President Obama's statement as him changing his mind about an emissions trading scheme. That is simply not true. He is accepting the domestic political realities that he faces. As I said when I met with President Obama over the weekend, Australia and America are great mates. We are great mates and we will continue to be. ",89
133,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt is warned.,89
134,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But Australia is not an American state. We will make our own decisions in our national interest. The mid-term elections in America did not determine policy for us. We are Australians; we will make our own decisions. We will make our own decisions in this parliament, where the government has seized the opportunity presented by this parliament to see if we can work through for a parliamentary and community consensus on the most efficient way of dealing with carbon, and that is to put a price on it. The most efficient way of reducing carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon pollution. I am of that view; economists are of that view; President Obama is of that view. Right around the world nations are working through how best to deal with carbon, including pricing carbon. If the member does want to slavishly follow American examples-and I believe we are Australians and we will make our own decisions-then perhaps he would want to look to the example of California. As he would well know, if California were a nation it would be sitting at the table of the G20. It has moved to price carbon in its economy. In this public policy challenge of pricing carbon, my invitation remains to those on the opposition benches to turn away from their strategy of wrecking and looking for popular slogans, and to work with the government to get a measure done in the nation's interest. That is the approach we are taking, because I do not believe that it is in the interests of nation to not deal with the challenge of pricing carbon, or to not deal with the transformation of our economy to a low-pollution economy. We are determined to deal with this challenge and to work our way through. Members opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition, have had every position possible on this, the Leader of the Opposition changing his mind every 24 hoursfamously called a weather vane by the member for Wentworth. Now is the time to put those politics aside and to work with the government on something so clearly in our national interest. National interest before political interest: try it just once. Climate Change",89
135,Ms BRODTMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Minister, can you tell the House what implications the recent OECD survey of Australia has for climate change policy? What work is the government undertaking to examine action already taken globally on climate change?",90
136,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Canberra for her question. In its latest economic survey of Australia, as has been reported today, the OECD had some very important things to say about climate change policy and how it should be applied within Australia. The OECD's main message was that setting a carbon price sooner rather than later was the best option for cutting carbon pollution within our economy. The OECD went on to say that the investment uncertainty in the electricity sector in particular should be removed ‘by the adoption of market mechanisms to set a price on carbon, thereby reducing emissions in an effective way'. The OECD, which is one of the premier international economic organisations, is clearly indicating what we already knowthis that is, that the best way of reducing carbon pollution and addressing the challenge of climate change is to set a carbon price via a market mechanism, and doing it sooner rather than later. The reality is that many countries around the world, including the United States and China, are already taking a comprehensive set of steps to reduce carbon pollution within their own economies and to tackle climate change. I am sure the House would be interested to learn that 85 countries that have committed themselves to the Copenhagen Accord, representing approximately 80 per cent of global emissions, have pledged targets and other actions to reduce pollution and to tackle climate change. Also, and pursuant to the previous question to the Prime Minister, countries are doing this through a range of different measures. They may include carbon taxes, they may include emissions trading schemes, they are including renewable energy targets and they are including subsidies for low-emission technologies. Each one of these policy approaches puts an effective price on carbon, even if that carbon price is not as overtly stated as it is through some particular mechanisms. With that in mind the government has asked the Productivity Commission to determine the carbon price that is already adopted or planned by a number of other nations with which we have important trading relationships, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, New Zealand, China, India, Japan and South Korea. The purpose of the Productivity Commission's study will be to identify the effective carbon price in those important economies with which we have substantial trading relationships. This is extremely important, not only to understand the action that is being taken by our trading partners but also to properly assess the competitive arguments relating to the establishment of a carbon price in our own economy. The Productivity Commission will be due to report with that study by May of next year. It is a piece of work that was commissioned at the initial suggestion of the member for New England, and I thank him for that contribution. The Prime Minister mentioned a moment ago the progress of the government's multiparty climate change committee. There have been very constructive discussions which stand in total contrast with the approach taken by the Leader of the Opposition and those behind him on the opposition benches; it is also a position totally in contrast with the advice of the OECD. National Curriculum",90
137,Mr FLETCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the rejection on Friday of the national curriculum by the New South Wales Board of Studies, which means the curriculum will not start nationwide in January 2011. Given that the implementation of the national curriculum has lost its way, how does the minister for schools' continuing to insist that the curriculum begins in January 2011, in spite of it not being ready, indicate that the government has found its way?",91
138,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Every factual assertion in that question is not right. The government will continue with the national curriculum.,91
139,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,91
140,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I just said, every factual assertion in that question is not right. The government will continue with the national curriculum. It really amazes methough I do understand that the member asking this question is still relatively new to the parliament-that this question would be asked by the opposition, when over 12 long years, despite persistent calls for a national curriculum, absolutely nothing got done. Absolutely nothing, to the great disadvantage of the 80,000 school children who move interstate each year and to the great disadvantage of Defence Force families, who frequently move during their child's education, and to the great disadvantage of a nation that rightly wants to be assured that a quality, modern, relevant curriculum is being taught in every school in the country to give every child a great education. So whilst the Howard government slept through 12 years doing nothing profound on education reformincluding, instead, trying to tweak the politics of education to get sector fighting with sector and to try to periodically get a run in the newspaper by criticising others in education-we have got on with the job of reform in the interests of Australian students. And the thing that has been on our mind is not the politics of education; it is every child in every school, what they are learning and what opportunity that gives them in life. In pursuit of that vision of a great quality education for every child in every school we will continue with the national curriculum, which is part of a broad suite of education reform that is there to lift standards in every school, particularly to make a difference for those children most at risk of falling behind. I would have thought the member, and the members opposite, could at least try to share that vision of a great quality education for every child. Mr Hockey interjecting",91
141,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for North Sydney.,91
142,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But clearly the politics of wrecking even extends to that. Broadband,91
143,Mr MITCHELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. What progress is being made to roll out the National Broadband Network, why is the timely rollout important to regional Australia and what impediments are there to this progress?",91
144,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for MCEwen for his question. Certainly, as he would be aware, it is the case that services are already live in Tasmania. Services will go live in five first-release sites on the mainland early next year: Willunga, Brunswick, Townsville, Minnamurra/Kiama Downs and Armidale. At the same time we will begin construction on 19 second-release sites on the mainland. Some eight months ago we began work laying 6,000 kilometres of optical fibre backbone in six priority areas that had been identified by the ACCC as having the least competitive backhaul across Australia: between Perth and Geraldton, in south-west Gippsland, between Victor Harbour and the Adelaide Hills, between Broken Hill and Mildura and between Darwin, Longreach, Emerald and Toowoomba. And of course the member for Kennedy would be conscious that it began going both ways from Mount Isa. Some 60 per cent of this fibre infrastructure rollout is now complete and the first links will be ready on time and on budget in March of next year. We know that the opposition have had an alternative plan. They have had in fact 20 failed broadband plans. Under their 19th plan, they promised that funding would also occur for some regional back-haul infrastructure, with 100 per cent of it-just aboutstarting after June 2013. So, whilst we are getting on with the job of rolling out the National Broadband Network, creating some 25,000 direct jobs, delivering for regional Australia, those opposite simply want to delay. Those on this side of the House, and the Independents, understand that Australia simply cannot afford to delay universal high speed and affordable broadband, particularly in regional Australia. We will have a bit of a test this afternoon over whether those opposite stand for the national interest or for their own political interest, because the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010 will be debated and determined in the parliament this afternoon. It supports a wholesale-only openaccess NBN that will fundamentally transform competition in the sector. It is supported by industry, including Telstra, so it will be a real test this afternoon whether those opposite will vote for this legislation. They should support this legislation, as they should support what is the most important infrastructure project that we could possibly be proceeding with to bring Australia into the 21st century and to build productivity in this nation. Mental Health",92
145,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. The National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission recommends building early psychosis prevention and intervention centres, or EPPICs-which should not be confused with the quite separate headspace program. The government is contributing $25 million towards EPPIC, but this is only enough to build what Patrick MCGorry describes as ‘a heavily diluted cardboard cut-out service lacking many of the core features of EPPIC'. Considering that only a third of mental health cases are treated in Australia currently and that most new cases appear before age 25, will you now commit to better fund the EPPIC program?",92
146,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Denison for his question and know that he, like many other Australians, is concerned about mental health questions and ensuring services are available and funded. Like the member for Denison, I am a big admirer of the work of Pat MCGorry. He is actually a fair old legend in the part of the world that come from, Melbourne's west, where many of the services that he has become most famous for were first instigated and trialled. I am therefore well aware of the very good work done at EPPICs and the fact that the most critical burden of disease for the most profound mental illnesses impacts on our young people and that, if you are going to have one of these profound conditions, it is very likely to manifest when you are still in your teenage years or a young adult. So intervention at that stage does pay itself back over a lifetime. I am well aware of that, and the government is committed, with our new Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, to building on work done in the previous period of government to improve mental health services. I agree that Australians are asking us to look again at this area and look at what more can be done. I want to say to the member that, as a government, we have almost tripled funding for mental health programs, to $1.4 billion over the next four years. That includes a $450 million new investment announced by the government over the course of this year. As part of our National Health and Hospitals Network package, the government has committed $25.5 million to expand the EPPIC model outside Victoria. We have also funded up to an additional 30 headspace youth-friendly services to support a further 20,000 young people. During the recent election campaign, we also promised an extra $274 million to redouble our efforts on suicide prevention. As the member may well be aware, we lose more Australians each year to suicide than we do through our road toll, so suicide prevention is a critical problem for Australia. But I do understand the member's concern is genuine and, as a government, we do understand that in mental health we have got more work to do. Whilst I am not in a position to say to the member I now that we are able to provide more funding at this stage for EPPICs, I can assure him that the minister for mental health is working on building on our earlier reforms and we are very open to ideas from the member for Denison as we do that. Health Services",92
147,Ms ONEILL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Will the minister outline progress made on the GP superclinic program, including for the newly announced clinics?",93
148,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Robertson for her question. She has a keen interest, like many in this House, in news of the new 28 superclinics that were committed to during the election campaign. But I would like to give the House first an update, as I was asked to, on the first 36 superclinics. We are just over the halfway mark since the introduction of that program, a five-year program. We have seven operational superclinics across the country, we have eight that are operating early services, we have 17 that are under construction and we have more than a quarter of a million services that have been provided through the superclinics. I will give you a couple of short examples. I recently visited the Geelong superclinic, which services the electorates of Corangamite and Corio. The Prime Minister also visited that superclinic, just before its formal opening on 30 August. That service now has seven GPs. It has practice nurses, a physiotherapist, an exercise physiologist and a podiatrist. It has students commencing next year who will be trained in the superclinic, as part of the academic year. I know that the new member for Solomon has been to the Palmerston superclinic. It opened on 4 October and has been providing after-hours services since December 2008. It now has GP services, practice nurses, physiotherapy, dietetics and a clinical psychologist. The member for Blair, I understand, visited his GP superclinic in Ipswich. Its first stage has been opened and has had a very good reaction from patients, staff and the community. As well as talking about our existing program, I want to update the House on the process that has started for the new 28 clinics that are part of our $7.4 billion health reform plan. Many MPs in this House will know that I wrote to them some weeks ago seeking some further information, given that the opposition has opposed superclinicsMr Dutton-Playing politics is what you were doing.",93
149,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I gave members the courtesy of writing them a letter asking for their view. Contrary to the member for Dickson's view, many of his colleagues answered those letters. Many of those colleagues will be pleased to know that we have paid attention to their views. Eleven of the clinics have gone straight to an invitation to apply process, including the ones in Blacktown, Port Macquarie, Coffs Harbour and Nowra. I am sure that the members for Cowper and Gilmore will be pleased that those are going ahead. But, following requests for further consultations in their electorates from a number of members, 13 clinics will have a consultation process begun before they go to the invitation to apply stage. This includes, for example, the electorate of Adelaide and the electorate of Bonner, where the Wyndham superclinic will have further consultations. Four further clinics for which the operators have already been identified, like in Jindabyne and Rockingham, will proceed immediately to negotiations with those identified operators. This program is already delivering services to the community. More services are coming. More training is being provided. We are determined to make sure that if the community wants to see a GP they can access to one closer to their home and that students will be trained in their electorates. That is what this program is delivering. Broadband",94
150,Mr TUDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to claims by NextGen Networks and Optus that struggling families and pensioners will have to pay an extra $30 per month for a standard phone service thanks to the NBN. Given that the government has lost its way with the NBN, when will the government find its way and guarantee that households will not pay a cent more for a basic phone service?",94
151,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I agree with the member to this extent: there is a lot of misinformation out there about the NBN. A lot of misinformation is being used in fearmongering from the opposition. It happened before the election. Indeed, on the last day of the election campaign there was fearmongering about charges in relation to the NBN. The factual position is a very simple one: the government is working its way, through NBN Co., to rolling out around the country super fast broadband so that people can have the services that they need in the future. The Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has today taken the House through some of the details of that. It is also true that, as a result of the agreement that the government entered into with Telstra, we are looking forward to migrating customers from the old copper of order. The Prime Minister was asked a very simple question about whether these households would pay a cent more for a basic phone service. If she does not know the answer, she should simply sit down and take it on notice.",94
152,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,95
153,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was talking about the agreement that we have entered into with Telstra to migrate customers from the current copper network to the NBN. That gives rise to the answer to the member's question. He asked about telephone costs. On telephone costs, I refer him to statements made by the NBN Co. on this matter. They have said that the assertion that he has made in his question and other assertions that have been made in the public media about costs are not right and that they would not be recommending to shareholder ministers-obviously, the shareholder ministers are the ministers in the government with line responsibility and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation-a cost structure that would increase retail costs or costs paid by consumers for a telephone line. The NBN Co. has dealt with this matter. The member is responding to the fearmongering that is around. There is no need for him or any of his constituents to fear increased costs for having a telephone line in their home. It is simply not right. Look at what the NBN Co. has said. If you want to tell your constituents the truth, distribute that statement to them. Paid Parental Leave",95
154,Ms VAMVAKINOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Will the minister update the House on the implementation and importance of the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme?",95
155,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Calwell for her question and for her commitment to Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme. On 1 January next year, in just over six weeks, Australia will finally catch up with the rest of the developed world and see the implementation of our national Paid Parental Leave scheme. This will be such a significant day for thousands of mums and dads around the country who will be able to get that extra assistance that they need to help their newborn babies. After waiting for decades, Australia will finally get a national Paid Parental Leave scheme, and it is this federal Labor government that is delivering it. We know how important it is. That is why have taken the advice and are delivering up to 18 weeks of paid parental leave paid at the federal minimum wage, which is around $570 a week before tax. We estimate that around 148,000 parents will be eligible for paid parental leave. I can inform the House that parents are now ringing the Family Assistance Office or going online and registering for paid parental leave. They are getting their applications in for babies who are expected to be born in January and February next year. So far, more than 1,500 parents have registered for paid parental leave. Parents can now register up to three months in advance of the expected date of their baby's birth. That of course means that they can get all that paperwork done before their baby comes along. I am also very pleased to be able to inform the House that we have a number of employers who are also already registered to deliver paid parental leave on behalf of the government. We have more than 450 employers already registered to play their part in the government's scheme to deliver paid parental leave to their long-term employees. We are very pleased with the way in which employers are responding. They understand just how important it is for women to stay connected to the workforce, and we expect that this will improve the participation of women in the workforce. It demonstrates that these employers understand that paid parental leave is both good for their employees and good for their businesses. Mr Billson-What garbage! You fitted them up with a job you should have been doing.",95
156,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are starting to hear interjections from those opposite, who for 12 years refused to deliver paid parental leave. We know that the Leader of the Opposition famously said that paid parental leave would be introduced over his dead body. It is this government that is delivering paid parental leave, and on 1 January it will start. Cleaner Car Rebate Scheme",96
157,Mrs MIRABELLA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the comments of the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research regarding the cash-for-clunkers program that the government cannot guarantee when the cash-for-clunkers program will start and has not sorted out the design and delivery method. When will the Prime Minister admit that this program has lost its way and dump a program that is unaffordable, unworkable and undeliverable?",96
158,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question about the cleaner car rebate. I refer the member to the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which makes it clear that the start date of the program has been moved to 1 July next year and that it is in a consultation phase with industry. We want to make sure that we get the design of it right. As members would be aware, our transport system-the use of cars-is a very considerable contributor to greenhouse gases. We want to make a difference to that. The cleaner car rebate is one way of making a difference. Our mandatory standards for light vehicles are another way of making a difference. Mrs Mirabella interjecting",96
159,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know, of course, that the member for Indi does not believe in climate change, does not believe in acting on it, is very keen to wreck everything in this area and certainly played a role in making the Leader of the Opposition the leader so he could",96
160,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister will resume her place.  der: the Prime Minister was asked a question about the cash-for-clunkers scheme. She is now just engaging in an old-fashioned slag and bag, and you should sit her down.",96
161,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! We will not debate a point of order. I got the point of order. The member for Sturt needs to be a little careful with his descriptive use of language that is misinterpreted by some listeners or viewers. I just give him that hint. On the point of order, I simply say to the member for Sturt that what he had some trouble with was a result of the person who had asked the question continually interjecting throughout the answer. That does not necessarily mean that those interjections should be responded to, but quite often they are-and I understand why they are. It would helpful if there were fewer interjections and if ministers, in answering questions, would ignore the interjections. The Prime Minister is answering the question.",96
162,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In conclusion, this is one way of tackling climate change. We will get on with the job of doing it. Mrs Mirabella interjecting",96
163,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Indi!,96
164,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The opposition will continue with its wrecking strategy and with trying to paper over its current divisions on the question. Mrs Mirabella interjecting,96
165,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Indi is warned, and the warning is a precursor to naming.",97
166,Mr STEPHEN JONES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. Will the minister update the House on the progress of the Policy Transition Group in progressing the government's reforms to the taxation of resources?,97
167,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to advise the House that the work of the Policy Transition Group, which is jointly chaired by Don Argus and me, is progressing well. Face-to-face consultations have been held in five states to date, namely Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. We have also ensured that industry representatives from other states and territories have had ample opportunity to express their views to the Policy Transition Group. The last face-to-face consultation will be held in Melbourne this Friday and will be totally focused on the all important issue of exploration. I also note that there have been detailed submissions from a range of interested parties and they will, in due course, be given proper consideration by the Policy Transition Group. In this context, I note that the OECD economic survey of Australia, which was released yesterday, also supported the concept of a resources rent tax. In fact, the report emphasises the importance of getting the detail right, as we are seeking to do through the Policy Transition Group. The report states: As proposed by the government, a tax on resources rents is in principle highly efficient, it has no impact on investment and production decisions if properly designed and administered. Clearly, that is the objective of the Policy Transition Group and it is intended that we present our report to the Treasurer prior to Christmas. I also inform the House that, following our report to the Treasurer, the govTaxation ernment will release an exposure draft in the new year, which will give industry yet a further opportunity to actually comment on the government's intention with respect to where we go on this particular tax. Perhaps more importantly, the House should be advised that since our announcements on 2 July there have been a series of major announcements with respect to a pipeline of ongoing investment decisions in Australia. I can refer to, for example, the announcement by British Gas, of 1 November this year, of a $15 billion investment in a new industry in Australia: the coal seam methane export opportunity out of Gladstone in Queensland. Interestingly, there have also been a range of similar announcements-for example, Rio Tinto Iron Ore in Western Australia, an upgrade of their Cape Lambert export opportunities, with an investment of US$3.1 billion; BHP Billiton, with its coal opportunities at Mount Arthur in New South Wales, an investment of $784 million; and Xstrata with respect to its Ulan coal opportunities, an investment of US$1.1 billion. There have been many other announcements going to the issue of certainty of investment in terms of our announcements of 2 July. In conclusion, I simply say that, from the government's point of view, the Policy Transition Group process is actually going well. Industry understands the nature of the taxation arrangements which we announced on 2 July. I can also assure the House there is no intention by the government to change those announcements from what was agreed with industry. That, in turn, has created certainty since which has enabled investment to continue since 2 July this year. The government will put in place a new tax system which will ensure that the Australian community gets a fair return for the development of its national resources, based on the principles of equity, efficiency and investment neutrality. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Parliament House: Water Features",97
168,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, the first question is very simple. The water features around Parliament House are covered in shadecloth et cetera. Given the fact that, as I understand it, Canberra is no longer drought declared, can we look forward to these water features being reinstated?",98
169,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Canning for his question. I wish the Presiding Officers' policy on this matter was well understood, but I am not quite sure that it Separate to the state of the dams around Canberra, there has been work to reinstate four or five of the water features using water that is being harvested out of the air conditioning towers, with some basic engineering that has been used in other places. Investigation is ongoing about whether we will go forward on the basis of the state of the dams at the moment. It is a matter that I know many members would like to see us address and we are attempting to work out ways in which we can do it in a sustainable way. Parliamentary Library",98
170,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, my second question is in relation to resourcing the Parliamentary Library. Over the last few days I have endeavoured to get a Bills Digest on the bill that is being debated today, am. the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 4) Bill 2010. When making inquiries of the library, they pointed out to me that, because of the amount of private members' business and the position of the Independent members of the House, they believed they had insufficient resources to cover all of the Bills Digests. Could you look to see whether they are sufficiently well resourced to provide the full service to the members of this House?",98
171,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"As part of at least one, if not a number, of the agreements that were entered into before parliament resumed, a proper study of the resourcing of the library and of the committee system was agreed to. Those matters are in hand. It is true that, because of the state of the numbers in the House, with regard to a number of things that the House does it is stretching the resources. Preliminary bids have been made about that additional resourcing. Both the President and I are keeping an eye on this. But the final answer about the library is that, because of is. the agreement and a proper study of resourcing, that will be done. Parliament House: Noise",98
172,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I am reluctant to raise this, but I have raised this matter previously with Parliament House departmental officials. Early in the morning on sitting days there is a tendency for lawnmowers and air blowers to be used outside offices during radio interviews. On one occasion I actually had to stop the interview-I know it is hard to believe, Mr SPEAKER - until the noise had passed. Given that there is a considerable amount of time when parliament is not sitting and that we do not sit on Fridays, I again request that we do not have the extraordinary noise from lawnmowers and various other machinery being used outside our office windows between 7 am and 9",98
173,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I will take up the matter raised by the member for North Sydney with appropriate members of the Department of Parliamentary Services. NA,98
174,Mr RAMSEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, in the way of a personal explanation, I owe an apology. I inadvertently left an electronic device turned on during question time. I apologise to you and the House.",98
175,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I thank the member for Grey for taking that action on his own initiative. I would hope that all members see the distraction of live phones, although that was a pretty ordinary ring. It was not creative. But they are a distraction and I thank the member for Grey for the action that he has taken. I, on behalf of the House, accept his apology. NA Chamber Clock",99
176,Mr IRONS,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a question to you. I noticed that when the member for Indi came up to the dispatch box today the clock had started well before she was there and, by the time she got there, there were only 40 seconds left for her question. Government member interjecting",99
177,Mr IRONS,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Well, it is part of your new paradigm. Mr Speaker, could you please tell us what the procedure is for that?",99
178,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"We will have a look at it. I can assure you that nothing is being done in a deliberate fashion. If we talk about that dreadful expression ‘the new paradigm', it is all our business. If there are still training wheels on, that is regrettable, but I think that everybody in the circumstances is trying to make sure that things are done. I believe the member for Indi managed to get her question well within-if it was only 40 seconds-the 40 seconds. Mrs Mirabella interjecting Ms Gambaro-She struggled!",99
179,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I doubt whether the member for Indi would struggle on matters like that. I know that she would get it. NA,99
180,Mr ALBANESE,DOCUMENTS,"Documents are tabled in accordance with the list circulated to honourable members earlier today. Details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings and I move: That the House take note of the following documents: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission-Telecommunications reports for 2008-09Report 1: Telecommunications competitive safeguards; Report 2: Changes in the prices paid for telecommunications services in Australia. Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority-Report for 2009-10. Australian Prudential Regulation AuthorityReport for 2009-10.

181,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS,"by leave-I move: That the time and order of business for the sitting tomorrow, 16 November 2010, be as follows, unless otherwise ordered: (a) the House, at its rising, adjourn until tomorrow at 11 am; (b) government business have priority from 11 am until 2 pm; and (c) during the period from 11 am until 2 pm any division on a question called for in the House, other than on a motion moved by a Minister, shall stand deferred until the conclusion of the discussion of a matter of public importance. I will speak briefly to this resolution on behalf of the government. I thank the opposition for their cooperation in this matter. We are moving these extra three hours of sitting in the main parliamentary chamber to enable additional speakers who have not yet had the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Afghanistan to do so. It is intended that this will be the only matter of business before the parliament before 2 pm tomorrow. The Afghanistan motion will then be referred to the Main Committee. This will ensure that the Afghanistan debate in the House of Representatives is able to be concluded prior to the important meeting that will take place in Lisbon surrounding these matters. People would be aware that the defence minister leaves for Lisbon on Wednesday and the Prime Minister on Thursday. I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for his cooperation in this matter. Question agreed to. NA Court of Disputed Returns",99
182,The Clerk,ELECTION PETITIONS,"I present copies of the following petitions filed in the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns: Freemantle v ONEILL & Ors, in respect of the election of a member of the House for the division of Robertson; Green v Bradbury & Ors, in respect of the election of a member of the House for the division of Lindsay; and Briscoe-Hough v Melham & Ors, in respect of the election of a member of the House for the division of Banks. NA AMENDMENT (2010 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 October, on motion by Mr Garrett: That this bill be now read a second time.  speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010. The bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to allow revised funding amounts for the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, for Commonwealth scholarships and for other Commonwealth grants. It also provides for future funding to move toward a student demand driven system of Commonwealth supported university places. This marks the transition from a system where student places at universities are capped to a system where the government will fund a place for every eligible undergraduate student accepted into an eligible course. This measure was announced in the 2010-11 budget and reflects the recommendation by the Bradley review into higher education, which was delivered to the government in late 2008. Specifically, this bill, by taking the first step toward a student demand driven system, will assist in meeting the government's objective for 40 per cent of Australians between the ages of 25 and 34 to have at least a bachelor level degree by 2025. This begins with lifting the cap on enrolments from 2010 and 2011 from five to 10 per cent, with the transition to a student centred funding system from 2012. This bill itself has no financial impact for the implementation of the transition toward a student demand driven system. Rather, from 2012 there will no longer be a maximum amount in table A, but its practical effect will result in future higher expenditure. Maximum funding amounts at section 30-5, section 41-45 and section 46-40 of the act will also be amended to account for indexation. I note that this is to be based on the present safety net adjustment, introduced in 1997 by the Howard government, which comprises 75 per cent of the current index. The coalition is committed to the principle of the continuation of indexation for higher education and, by implication, the current arrangements regarding indexation as they stand in this bill. Indexation arrangements will change, of course, following the new arrangements to be introduced from 2012. The government have elected to use the professional, scientific and technical services labour price index reduced by 10 per cent to replace the safety net adjustment, after a period of significant consultation with the sector. The bill also reduces funding to the Graduate Skills Assessment program by $2.4 million across the years 2010-11 to 2013-14 in line with a diminishing public interest in the program. But there is also another amendment to the Higher Education Support Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010 upon which I would like to comment. The bill seeks to reduce funding to the Australian Technical and Learning Council by $18.4 million, reflecting the establishment of the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency and the fact that part of the agency's budget will be allocated indirectly towards the council. While the opposition does not consider this redirection of funds to be controversial, the role and structure of the future Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency may certainly have the potential to be. Already we see that even before TEQSA is created there is growing debate about just exactly how the government should go about bringing change to monitor and assure standards. I have previously stated that, while the coalition supports in principle the development of a national regulatory agency, we hope to consult carefully about the details of the governance and powers of TEQSA in the months ahead. We need to give the most careful consideration to the new standards that will be used to judge our institutions and other important aspects of regulatory regimes. The coalition will continue to monitor future activity and advocate for a higher education system that is flexible and responsive. We recognise that not all higher education providers are alike and we will not let the sector be burdened unnecessarily without justification. While the coalition welcomed the Bradley review when it was released and many of the recommendations in it, including the recommendation that has translated to this bill, I take the opportunity to reflect on where we go from here. Unlike the government, we believe that the Bradley review is not merely a list of boxes to tick off over time. It is much more. The reforms stemming from the Bradley review should be considered the beginning of ongoing debate and reform in the higher education sector. We appreciate the move towards a student demand driven system proposed by Professor Bradley and endorsed by the government. The measure in this bill is a start, but I also believe there is much more scope to meet the ambitious target set by the government of 40 per cent of Australians between the ages of 25 and 34 years having at least a bachelor level degree by 2025. For example, when we look overseas for potential solutions we find that there are some countries like Norway that have already met this target. Universities cannot be held to account to meet this target alone, though having the freedom to offer a sufficient number of places to students to meet demand is certain to assist in reaching these ambitious targets. We also need to think about new and innovative ways to modify existing educational structures to facilitate progress from one stage of education to the next. We do need fewer ports of entry into education to make choices and pathways easier and clearer for potential students. The coalition is also deeply concerned about the direction and future of the new national curriculum, for a quality curriculum needs to be carefully designed to meet the future challenges in Australia and the labour market. Though this government has taken some steps to improve coordination between schools, private enterprise and post-secondary education, I believe that we could still do much more. We are concerned in the coalition that, if a national curriculum is introduced that is rushed, poorly implemented, not well thought out, badly funded and teachers are not given the training they need to ensure the national riculum is what students need and what schools want, the pathway to higher education will be made that much harder as universities look to their own enrolment tests rather than relying on the year 12 marks that schools currently undertake. And we most definitely need a much easier recruitment and pathway process to higher education for vocational education and training, which leads me to comment on the dramatic change between the previous government and this government in relation to the responsibilities for education. Education in the previous government was found in the same portfolio as universities, training, apprenticeships and so on with respect to the pathway through education in most people's lives. Since the election of this government the portfolio has been divided between the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, Senator Evans, the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Simon Crean, and of course the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Peter Garrett. The purpose for this division of responsibilities can only be to make the scrutiny of education less able for the opposition and is probably a response to the very effective breaking down of the government's facade in education in the last three years when the current Prime Minister, as Minister for Education, presided over what can only be described as another Labor mess-whether it was the national curriculum, the My School website or, most importantly, the school hall stimulus debacle. Many of the aspects of education under Minister Gillard proved to be failures, and when she was asked before the election for her list of achievements as Minister for Education the only one she could name in an entire portfolio covering everything from universities, apprenticeships and training to curschools, education and child care was the setting up of the My School website. So a website was the No. 1 achievement of the Prime Minister when she was the Minister for Education and one can only assume that the responsibilities for education have been so disbursed in order to make it harder for the public to be aware of the ongoing failures of the government in relation to education. But I can ensure the House that we, from the opposition side, will continue to monitor the ongoing failures of the government in education. The one that is looming largest is the national curriculum, which was designed to be in place by January 2011 and most clearly will not meet that deadline. Only last Friday, the New South Wales Board of Deputies, which is responsible for schools education in New South Wales, wrote to the New South Wales Minister for Education and Training, Verity Firth, indicating that they would not be implementing the national curriculum in January 2011. Other state jurisdictions will follow and we are seeing the unravelling of the national curriculum for a number of reasons. We have a minister, in the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, who is quite incapable of delivering a program. He was the same minister who presided over the solar panels debacle, the Green Loans scheme and the tragic home insulation scheme. He has now been given the hospital pass of the Prime Minister's national curricurenewal. lum to introduce, and of course he cannot recognise that this is going the same way as the other programs that he has presided over as minister. The courageous thing to do, which the government will not do, is to announce that the national curriculum will not be introduced from January 2011 and accept the opposition's proposal, which is given generously and without any hooks or barbs, that we will allow them to delay lum until January 2012 without us trying to score any political points, because we would prefer students got a better curriculum that was ready to be introduced in 2012 rather than a rushed curriculum, poorly implemented, cumbersome and facing criticism from all sides. We also need continued efforts in youth programs, to encourage those youth who are neither undergoing education nor employed, who are at risk or from disadvantaged backgrounds, to access appropriate support services. All of these are policy areas that can and should be considered by the government as it works towards its set target of 40 per cent of youth having at least a bachelor level degree by 2025. Moving to a student demand driven system is one measure, but we must not forget the other elements that I have touched on as we work toward this goal. Nevertheless, in spite of some of the criticisms that we have made, the coalition is pleased that Labor has at least undertaken uncapping of student places in the bill, and for this reason we support the legislation as drafted.",100
183,Ms ONEILL,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I am pleased to be able to speak today on this bill, the Higher Education Support Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010. What is the purpose of this bill? It is very clearly an indication of this government's commitment to education, particularly to higher education, which is in such need of There are three key points that this bill seeks to address: to increase funding to eligible providers for the Commonwealth Grant Scheme in 2010 and 2011, to increase funding to eligible providers for other grants for the years 2010 to 2013 and appropriate funding for these grants for 2014, and to increase the maximum payments for Commonwealth scholarships for the years 2010 to 2013 and appropriate funding for these the curricu- scholarships for 2014. Not that long ago-in fact, just before the federal election-I had a life as a university lecturer. The purpose of this legislation certainly meets with the demands in our local economy and our wider community and certainly with the needs of universities to be able to fund more places for students and to do it in a well-organised manner. Now I get to give a lecture to the Manager of Opposition Business, who has actually just left the chamber-he must have got wind of the comment that I am about to make-about his selective talk in this debate about the government's higher education agenda. I must admit it is quite a challenge for any teacher to give a good lecture, but I am certainly up for the challenge here this afternoon. Let's start with the basics of this bill, which amends the Higher Education Support Act to implement these 2010-11 budget measures. The bill provides for an increase in funding for the over-enrolment of Commonthe wealth supported places that occurred in 2009 and 2010 under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme and for the increases that will flow on into 2011 under that scheme. This is a parameter update to reflect new estimates of student demand for the government's student centred funding system. Members may recall that we in the government introduced the student centred funding system in response to the review of higher education by Professor Denise Bradley. And what a relief it is to have students at the centre of the sion making in higher education. All too often processes and organisations dominate the discourse. We need to have students at the centre, and that is one of the critical dimensions of this bill that I am so positive about. The over-enrolment of Commonwealth supported places is allowed for under the cap on funding for places above agreed targets. The cap on over-enrolment was raised from five to 10 per cent in funding terms for 2010 and 2011, as part of the introduction of student centred funding from 2012. I hope the opposition cannot put up the usual roadblocks to this non-controversial piece of legislation, which enables more learning for more people and correct funding for our universities. Already today in the House, from the member for Wentworth, we have seen the kind of obstructionist spoiling behaviour that is now the hallmark of the coalition under the current Leader of the Opposition. I am afraid to say that behaviour will probably be on display again later this week, when the coalition will try to block funding for Australian university students and the vital student support services they need. These blatant political delaying tactics are being employed by the coalition for no purpose other than to delay the implementation of good things for young Australian people in the context of the tertiary education sector. They plan to gum things up, to block and delay. This is not in the national interest. Labor, in contrast, is working to restore critical services including child care, counselling, health, and sport and fitness services to university campuses across Australia. The Liberal Party is determined to block and delay this vital reform. The government introduced the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2010 in the first sitting week in a bid to provide a balanced, practical approach to funding campus serdecivices and amenities. It was introduced by the government as a priority in a bid to see it passed by Christmas so that the benefits would flow to students studying in 2011. Universities and students are united in their support for this measure, but the Liberal Party is determined to play a negative, blocking role. As a result of the previous coalition government's decision to abolish student services and amenities fees, close to $170 million was ripped out of university funding. This had a dramatic impact, particularly on regional universities and regional and rural students. I can confirm from my own personal experience as a lecturer in education at the University of Newcastle's Central Coast campus that this was certainly the case. Our student body would grow and thrive if it had strong campus support services. It is critically important in regions such as my own to acknowledge the fact that many of our students are the first in their family to attempt tertiary study. When you are in such a position there are a number of practical challenges that you have to meet. Firstly, which university are you going to go to? That can be the first question. How am I going to find access? Am I eligible for access? Am I a person who can undertake this challenge? Am I a person who can lift outside of my own experience and undertake tertiary study? These are challenges that students face, and when they arrive they need support. They need to connect into a new community. We have students on the Central Coastand it is a similar situation in many regional areas-who come from all over the coast, and they meet with new people of a range of ages. Sport, for example, is a great way in which people can meet others in a teamwork situation, bringing the skills they already have in order to develop social networks. Such things underpin the success of all learners. We do not perform well in circumstances where we feel very vulnerable, and certainly when we are disconnected. Learning is a risk event-every day going to the edge of what you know and taking up the challenges of knowing more, understanding more and thinking more deeply. And at the end of the day that is the journey of a student-to be able to do new things. Students need to be supported in their university environment so that the money that is invested for our country's future by the government is really invested well. Students are more likely to be successful if they have that sort of cial support in their new learning environment. There are other issues that are critical new students in these areas and for which the funding has disappeared-such as students who need particular study skills. They should not be provided with a ‘sheep-dip opportunity' where they get one token lecture on how to undertake their studies. There are students who hit the sixth week of a 13-week semester who have sincere practical difficulties in this area. They may have no skill base to balance their university work with their employment commitments and, perhaps, their family commitments. Trying to balance those things can be a very important management issue, and intervention with a student counsellor who has experience in these matters is vital for students to be able to manage that transition and to continue successfully in their journey to the end of the semester. Given the loss of $170 million over the last several years, we dare not count the cost of the numbers of students who have fallen out of universities through losing faith learn. in themselves. They have lost hope of participation in tertiary education because they have not been able to feel like they belong to a university-and belonging is a vital part of learning. The stories that I have just shared with you from my own experience are certainly borne out in last week's survey by the National Union of Students on students' perceptions of higher education quality. This poll, engaging more than 6,855 students from every public university in the country, was conducted earlier this year. It foundunsurprisingly to me, at least-that regional students and those at satellite sites attached to major university campuses faced difficulties and costs in accessing books from the main campus. And that is not the only cost that they incur; there is a whole dislocation so- that can happen in those sorts of contexts. The organisation's survey also revealed that nearly half of all respondents thought for their university was not doing enough to bridge the cultural divide between domestic and international students. We are global citizens. We live in a globalised economy. The opportunity for conversations and cultural sharing of varieties of knowledge between students from a range of nations is something we should definitely be investing in and enabling. Those students who are unhappy about these things need look no further than to the other side of the chamber to point the finger of blame. I know first hand how much importance students place on the quality of their educational experience. Issues such as the quality of teaching get much attention, but the real focus here, and that is why this particular piece of legislation is so good, is the focus on the student's experience-in this case, the learning experienceand students' capacity to access services on campus is vitally important for them to create an environment that enables them to Labor has a long standing commitment to ensuring the quality of all education, but particularly at this time higher education. We have a 10-year reform agenda that places a clear focus on quality and this is supported real terms by record investment. The new Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency is one element of these critical reforms. From 2012, universities that improve student satisfaction with teaching and learning and that increase the proportion of low socio-economic status students will be rewarded. In my experience, students who come from low socio-economic backgrounds have been marginalised for too long from participation, from a sense of high endeavour and from access to all of the professions. The NUS survey reminds us that all students from regional campuses are disadvantaged when it comes to accessing services that students in urban centres take for granted. The Gillard government wants to help redress that balance by restoring important student services. The bill proposes two budget measures to cease funding for the Graduate Skills Assessment-the GSA program-from 30 June 2010. This will generate savings of $2.4 million over four years. According to information in the 2010-11 budget, these funds will be redirected to support other government priorities, and the My University website will incorporate the program. The GSA was a voluntary test introduced in 2000 and was designed to assess the generic skills of university graduates both at the point of entry to, and exit from, university but, not surprisframework ingly, there has been a diminishing student interest in the GSA-which is something that they see generally as an administration event that does not enhance the quality of their experience. The other budget measure which the bill proposes to implement is a 20 per cent reduction in funding of $18.4 million over three years from 2011-12 for the Australian Learning and Teaching Council. The ALTC receives approximately $27 million annually to support a range of programs designed to in enhance and support the quality of teaching in Australian universities. This measure is a consequence of the establishment of the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency. The ALTC will receive funding from the TEQSA. Another key initiative will be the additional funding under new mission based compacts. Australian universities will have up to $550 million in additional funding under new mission based compacts. The introduction of compacts and new arrangements for performance funding are part of the government's commitment to investing in the future of higher education and ensuring Australia's higher education system better meets Australia's future needs. Universities will be eligible for $94.2 million in annual facilitation funding from 2011 and $136.6 million each year in reward funding from 2012. Over the three calendar years of the compacts, this amounts to $550 million. Targets will be set in three key areas. I think that these are really important targets that note and guide us to the change in focus. The target areas are: participation and social inclusion, including the enrolment of more students of low socio-economic status; the quality of student experience; and the quality of learning outcomes. The Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, Senator Evans, has said that the includes some interim indicators and plans to develop improved measures of performance over time. The government will negotiate with the universities in 2011 to develop this further. I commend the bill to the House.",103
184,Mr FRYDENBERG,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010, as presented by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations. This bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003. The bill raises the funding cap on Commonwealth funding provided to Australian universities and assists universities during the transition to increased numbers of student centred places. Under the 2009-10 budget, the government provided approximately $491 million over the forward estimates to fund 80,000 Commonwealth supported places and a transition for universities to incorporate overenrolment. On an assessment of potential over-enrolments, under the government's program, it is now estimated that there will be an additional 115,000 Commonwealth supported places over the period 2010 to 2013. Those on this side of the chamber support this bill so long as it is closely monitored over the forward estimates, particularly in regard to universities self-funding overenrolments through a reliance on the foreign student market. The increasing reliance by universities on fees from foreign students must be monitored as the economic reality today is that the high Australian dollar, cult economic conditions abroad and a competitive international student market mean that the large number of foreign students that have been coming to our shores in recent years is not guaranteed to continue. I have seen this first hand in my electorate of Kooyong at Swinburne University. The coalition strongly supports an open and flexible higher education system. This bill is consistent with a student demand driven system as proposed by the Bradley review. Let us not forget that it was the Howard government that made the first moves towards a student demand driven system. In the last year of the Howard government a record 185,898 Australians were offered a university place. The $1.9 billion Realising Our Potential package introduced significant new funds into key areas and saw a dramatic increase in the level of Commonwealth scholarships that were designed to ensure that Australia's best and brightest had every opportunity to reach their potential. In the same way, the Howard government increased the repayment threshold applying to student repayments on Commonwealth supported places, formerly known as HECS-HELP loans, to just short of $40,000, making a world's best practice student contribution scheme even more accessible. While the bill before the House proposes to increase funding for Commonwealth scholarships, funding for these scholarships has decreased since 2009, when the Higher Education Support Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Act redirected Commonwealth scholarships funding to support student income reform measures. It is high time that funding for Commonwealth scholarships be returned to previous levels. Between 1995 and 2006 there was a 23 per cent increase in the number of students from low socio-economic backgrounds attending university. In diffithis period we also saw a 15 per cent increase in students from rural areas, a 137 per cent rise in students with a disability and a 30 per cent growth in Indigenous students at our universities. In addition the Howard government also made a significant investment of more than $6 billion in the Higher Education Endowment Fund-a visionary plan to support the building of new university infrastructure. It is an indictment of those opposite that this initiative has not received the requisite political support. Our universities are a critical component of Australia's education system, integral as they are to our civil society and to our future prosperity. The coalition supports this bill, contributing as it does to the health of our tertiary sector.",106
185,Dr LEIGH,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I rise today to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010. This bill is about expanding universities and modernising Australia's university system so that it is really fit for purpose to match the needs of the labour market of the next generation. Students graduating from Australian universities in 2010 are going to be entering a labour market which is fundamentally different from the labour market of their parents. It is important is that universities provide them with the skills and opportunities necessary for this new and changing labour market. There is a great Labor legacy of adapting the educational system to meet the needs of the Australian labour market. One of the key features of the first speeches on this side of the parliament has been the issue of education. Many, like myself, have spoken about the power of education to raise living standards throughout Australia. Many others have also spoken about the role that education plays in breaking the intergenerational poverty cycle. You need only to read a few autobiographies of kids from the wrong side of the tracks who have made it to see that consistent theme of a great education being Australia's best leveller. I am proud today to rise in support of a bill which follows very much the education reforming legacies of the Chifley, Whitlam and Hawke governments, all of which brought about substantial expansions to Australia's higher education system. The Rudd and Gillard governments have followed very much in that tradition. I am very proud to have within my own electorate of Fraser a number of Australia's great tertiary institutions. The Australian National University, the University of Canberra, the Australian Catholic University and UNSW at ADFA are just a few of the terrific institutions in my electorate. But it is important to remember, whenever we are talking about higher education, where we are today and where we could have been. In 1996 Australia ranked seventh out of OECD countries in terms of attainment of undergraduate or higher qualifications amongst 25to 34-yearolds. By 2006 Australia had dropped to ninth position, according to the Bradley review. That is because other countries surpassed us in their share of young people who have attained a tertiary qualification. Countries such as Finland, Sweden and New Zealand have our increasing tertiary participation at a faster rate than Australia and have set targets for tertiary participation of up to 50 per cent. The Bradley review noted that: These policy decisions elsewhere place us at a great competitive disadvantage unless immediate action is taken. One of the things that we saw under the former Howard government was an increase in student-staff ratios. Back in 1996 there were 15 students for every tertiary staff member. By 2006, which is the final year the Bradley review uses in its analysis, that number had risen to 20 to one. We saw a substantial increase in class sizes in universities over the period of the Howard government, and that is probably a contributor to low student satisfaction levels. According to the Bradley review, from 1996 to 2007 the levels of university graduates' ‘satisfaction on the good teaching, appropriate workload, clear goals and standards, and learning community scales have remained either about or below 50 per cent for this whole period'. In other words, at least half of Australia's university students were dissatisfied with the quality of teaching they received, with workload, with goals and standards, and with their institutions as learning communities. The Bradley review noted: Australia is falling behind other countries in performance and investment in higher education. So what this legislation does today is bring about critical changes in indexation. I am pleased today to be following on this side of the House the member for Robertson, who, like me, has had substantial experience in seeing how Australian tertiary institutions struggled to cope in the old environment. I have seen first hand, as a professor at the Australian National University, the tough decisions that have to be made when wages increase substantially faster than Commonwealth indexation. That gap between wage growth and Commonwealth indexation means that universities have to make tough choices. The more wages outstripped funding the more we had to cut positions, forcing young researchers who were doing terrific work at the frontiers of their fields to go and find jobs elsewhere. That was good perhaps for the institutions that snapped them up but bad in the long run for students and for the research being carried out by our Australian tertiary institutions. The Bradley review noted that: … Commonwealth funding per subsidised student in 2008 was about 10 per cent lower in real terms than it was in 1996 … This was the result of a combination of direct cuts, constrained indexation and shifting of the balance towards higher student contributions. That steady reduction in real Commonwealth funding had dramatic and painful impacts on Australia's tertiary institutions. I am pleased to note that the bill that we are speaking to today responds to a recommendation of the Bradley review. Specifically it responds to recommendation 27 by implementing a new indexation arrangement to ensure that universities' revenue does not continually decline. As the Bradley review said, there are ‘increased sources of non-government revenues that universities have developed since 1996' and ‘those sources of revenue cannot viably be increased at historical rates'. That is a recognition that some of those substantial shifts that we have seen in the tertiary education sector over the last 20 years are one-off shifts. It is not reasonable to assume that they are going to occur again. So the indexation factor within this bill is going to be determined through a combination of two sources. Three-quarters of the indexation factor will be derived from the Professional, Scientific and Technical Services Labour Price Index, which will be discounted by 10 per cent, as recommended by the Bradley review, to ‘require higher education institutions to pursue ongoing productivity gains'. That is not putting in place an unreasonable funding gap but is recognising that a 10 per cent difference is something that can encourage productivity enhancements within higher education institutions. The other quarter of the indexation factor will derive from the CPI to account for the non-salary component of the higher education index factor. That reflects the fact that not all of tertiary education funding is going to staff; something in the order of a quarter is going to capital funding and so the CPI is an appropriate indexation for that portion. The university sector has welcomed the improved indexation formula. As a result, the indexation is going to increase funding for the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, other grants and the Commonwealth scholarships. The legislation that we are debating today is part of a long economic and educational legacy of successive reforming Labor administrations. One of the reforms of which I am most proud was the HECS reforms put in place in 1989 and now known as the HELP scheme. I would like to use this opportunity to pay tribute to my former colleague at the Australian National University Professor Bruce Chapman for his integral role in putting in place what I will probably always refer to as HECS. The key to HECS was to recognise that a university education raises private incomes. My own work as an economist has looked at the quantum of that increase. It is in the order of a 50 per cent increase in take-home pay for a university graduate compared to somebody who has just finished high school with no further qualifications. It is fair, is in accordance with basic Australian principles of egalitarianism, that students who graduate from universities should make a contribution. But it is also critical to make sure that as students make that contribution it does not stop them attending university. They only make that contribution under the income contingent loan scheme when their earnings pass a certain threshold, set at around average earnings. Recognising that a university education has a social benefit, the income contingent loan does not cover the full cost of tuition. We recognise that we as a society are better off from rising tertiary attendance rates and so we, in the form of the government, kick in a portion of the bill to allow students to attend university. There has been some careful research done on the impact of HECS on the socio-economic mix of students who attend university. In particular, I am thinking here of a paper by Bruce Chapman and Chris Ryan which showed that the introduction of HECS in 1989 had no impact on the socio-economic mix of university students. The number of low-SES students attending university increased because we saw, thanks to HECS, a substantial rise in the number of university students across Australia. But the share of university students who were from low SES backgrounds stayed unchanged. So I regard HECS in that sense as a pro-poor measure and a measure which increased equality of opportunity across Australia. This next stage of reforms follows very much in the same tradition. Under the student centred funding system, the government will fund a Commonwealth supported place for every eligible university student accepted into an eligible course at a public university-a substantial shift in our higher education system and one that I am delighted to hear that those opposite support. They were not, alas, able to bring it home during their and it 11½ years in government, but I am glad to hear that they are supporting it now that a Labor government is putting it into place. This will be a reform which recognises that the labour market of, say, 2050 is going to be one which increasingly requires high levels of abstract thinking skills and where we will naturally want to increase the number of young Australians who have a tertiary qualification. It is estimated, as the member for Kooyong has noted, that there will be an additional 115,000 Commonwealth supported places over the period 2010-2013. That is 115,000 young Australians who would not otherwise have got a chance to go to university but for this bill. That is a terrific thing and one of which all members of this House should be greatly proud. Finally, I would like to use this moment to acknowledge Peter Davidson of the National Tertiary Education Union. Peter, a fierce advocate of better universities, alas passed away on 29 October of this year. I extend my condolences to his family and in particular to his widow, Tanya. I also use this opportunity to thank Emily Murray, a volunteer in my office, who has been a tremendous help in preparing my remarks today. I commend the bill to the House. Debate interrupted. NA",108

198,Mr TEHAN,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I rise in support of the Higher Education Support Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010 and, in doing so, I place on the record that I very much support it, especially the 115,000 extra places between 2010 and 2013 that it will lead to. But I note for the record that one of the things that we will need to closely monitor with regard to this bill is whether those places extend into regional universities and into regional university the campuses as well as into the major universities in our capital cities. When we talk about tertiary participation we have to talk about tertiary participation across all of Australia, and that includes our regions and country areas. I particularly note that, in the electorate of Wannon, Deakin University has a very good regional campus in Warrnambool. We have had an overallocation of places at that university and I would hope that the 115,000 extra places will benefit Deakin University and in particular the campus at Warrnambool, which is a strong, thriving regional campus and should be supported by the Commonwealth government. I would also like to take the opportunity to raise an issue that has not been raised in the debating of this bill, and that is to do with the independent youth allowance. While we are talking about tertiary participation, we need to talk about the decline in students from country areas who are accessing tertiary education. It is all very well to talk about tertiary participation and put a bill forward which encourages that, but then with one hand take away the ability for country students to access a tertiary education. That is exactly what the Rudd/Gillard government did in the last term. This House has spoken very clearly on the matter of the independent youth allowance. We had a motion about three weeks ago clearly stating that the government has got this policy wrong. So, while we can all stand here in agreement on this bill-and we are in agreement-unless we do something to reverse the decline in country students accessing a tertiary education, this bill will be meaningless to a lot of country students. In my electorate of Wannon there are clear examples of this. For instance, if you grow up in Coleraine you can qualify for the independent youth allowance and it is easier for you to access a tertiary education. If you grow up in Hamilton, which is only 20 kilometres away, you do not get access to the independent youth allowance and therefore it is harder for you to go to the city, if that is where you want to get your tertiary education, and to access an affordable tertiary education. The same goes for Timboon and Cobden. There is 20 kilometres difference, and where you were born will determine whether you get help in accessing a tertiary education. The same goes for Halls Gap and Stawell. Once again there is only 20 kilometres difference, but where you were born, or you are residing, will make a huge difference to your ability to afford a tertiary education. In this chamber three weeks ago there was a vote on this. The Independents sided, rightly, with the coalition to call the government to account and tell them to make changes again so that the independent youth allowance would be accessible to country students in regional areas. So far the government has not acted. If we are serious about this new paradigm, when the parliament votes and calls the government to account and says it has got it wrong on a matter, the government should listen and act. Otherwise, this so-called new paradigm is meaningless. We can vote in here on numerous bills but if the government will not listen when this chamber says it has got it wrong then everything we are doing is meaningless. I call on the Independents who, rightly, voted with the coalition on that bill to hold the government to account on that matter. It is all very well for us to sit here and vote, but if they will not follow that up with action, if they will not lobby the government to change its policy on this, what we are doing under this so-called new paradigm means nothing. I call on the independents to side with the coalition and put further pressure on the government to change its view on the independent youth allowance, because the statistics are damning. Country students are accessing tertiary education less and less because of the question of affordability. If we are to be serious about providing 115,000 extra university places over the next three years, we have to make sure that they are accessible in an equitable form to country students as well as their urban cousins. We all know from our own careers and our own accessing of tertiary education that it is the great enabler. We have heard from the other side that it has the ability to increase your income when you access employment. If education is the great enabler, we have to ensure that it can be accessed across the board. So far, we have not heard this mentioned. I am hoping that in the further debate on this matter this issue will continue to be raised, because it is absolutely vital that all Australians, no matter where they live, get access to a good, healthy and decent tertiary education.",111
199,Mr GARRETT,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (4.35 pm)-in reply-I rise to sum up the contributions that have been made in the House on the Higher Education Support Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010. This bill reflects the government's continued commitment to an unprecedented investment in our universities through the full funding of the studentcentred funding system. The commitment will deliver a growing and sustainable higher education system. Under the student-centred funding system the government will fund a Commonwealth supported place for every eligible undergraduate student accepted into an eligible course at a public university. There is a transitional period in 2010 and 2011 during which the cap on overenrolment for Commonwealth supported places will be lifted from five per cent to 10 per cent in funding terms. Australian universities are in a good tion to deliver on the government's higher education attainment ambition that, by 2025, 40 per cent of all 25to 34-year-olds will hold a qualification at bachelor level or above, with an estimated additional 115,000 Commonwealth supported places over the period 2010-13. In the 2010-11 budget the government provided an additional $986 million over the four years to 2013-14 for anticipated growth in Commonwealth supported places and for overenrolments in 2009. This bill provides $681 million of that funding for 2010 and 2011 for additional Commonwealth supported places in those years and for the overenrolments in 2009. Following the implementation of the student centred funding system in 2012, the Higher Education Support Act will no longer have maximum amounts for the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, as there will be no overall limit on the number of students that table A higher education providers will be able to enrol. This means the bill does not provide an update for the additional funding for Commonwealth supported places in the years 2012 and onwards. Funding from 2012 will be based on enrolment numbers. Revised indexation arrangements for 2012 for programs funded under the Higher Education Support Act 2003, already provided in the Higher Education Support Amendment (Indexation) Bill 2010, will promote improved quality by ensuring that funding for teaching and learning and research keeps pace with increasing costs. This will contribute towards the overall financial stability and viability of the higher education sector and will provide greater certainty for individual institutions when planning for future development. The new indexation funding will provide an additional $2.6 billion to the sector over the years 2011 to 2015. This bill promotes a diverse, responsive posiand dynamic higher education sector that delivers benefits for universities, for their students and, in turn, for the wider Australian community. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",113

201,Mr TURNBULL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"At the outset, let me restate our position on the National Broadband Network, the construction of which is the context for almost all of the provisions in the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010. The coalition is committed to making fast and affordable broadband available to all Australians, regardless of where they live. We believe that the achievement of this goal will be assisted by a competitive telecommunications sector and recognise that competition would be enhanced by the separation of Telstra's customer access network from its retail business. Those apparently then are the objectives of all members. The challenge is to realise them in a way that minimises the expense to taxpayers and ensures Telstra shareholders are treated fairly and equitably. This bill involves a number of changes to the legislation which are objectionable and a number of changes which are desirable. While there are many things in this bill that we agree with, it is, like the curate's egg, good only in parts. The NBN scheme involves the overbuilding and dismantling of the entire Telstra customer copper access network. It involves $43 billion of taxpayers' money being invested to create a government owned fixed line monopoly. This monopoly will be reinforced by contractual agreements that prevent Telstra from using its HFC network-that is its pay television network, which is not going to be decommissionedin other voice and data services in competition with the NBN. So part of the deal is that, purely for the purpose of underpinning the already dodgy economics of the NBN, the government is entering into a contract with Telstra which will preclude Telstra from competing with the NBN using its HFC network. The government looks forward, we know-because it said so-to doing a similarly anticompetitive deal with Optus. The objective is to not only create a government owned business monopoly but entrench it using the power of the parliament to eliminate and inhibit competition. That is turning back more than 20 years of economic reform in Australia. It is a reversion to the pattern of state governments in particular owning businesses and using their governmental and political muscle to protect those inefficient monopoly businesses. That is one of many reasons why this proposal needs to be carefully analysed and why it should, as we have recommended and indeed as the OECD has recommended, have a cost benefit analysis of it undertaken by the Productivity Commission. Telstra shareholders are going to get $11 billion of after tax value for this. As a consequence, the Telstra board supports the deal. But our responsibility here is to the taxpayers of Australia. I have said a number of times that in many respects this NBN proposal represents a conspiracy against the taxpayers. We have vendors that want to sell equipment. We have contractors who want to dig ditches and lay fibre. We have telcossome of them, not all of them-who see this as a great business opportunity and certainly support the end to the vertical integration of Telstra. We have Telstra's management seeing this as a home run for their shareholders. David Thodey, the chief executive of Telstra, sees Stephen Conroy as playing Alan Bond to Thodey's Kerry Packer. It is an absolute home run for him. No doubt, he hopes that at some point the NBN will fail for whatever reason and he might be able to, like Kerry Packer, buy it back for a fraction of the Our job here is to protect the interests of the taxpayers. The policy objective should be as follows: to deliver universal and affordable broadband across Australia. That is number one. We should do so in a way that imposes the lowest net cost to Australian taxpayers. We need to ensure that we have an industry that is truly competitive. Thus we need to end the vertical integration of Telstra, but we need to do so in a way that is fair to Telstra shareholders. The primary objective is for universal and affordable broadband and the other secondary objectives support the primary one. The question is: is this the best way to achieve that objective? It is certainly the most expensive way. In fact, it is difficult to imagine a means to a policy objective that could be more burdensome on the taxpayer than the one proposed here with the NBN. A more prudent approach, and one that has been recognised as entirely feasible for many years, would be to see the Telstra customer access network transferred into a separate company owned initially perhaps by Telstra's current shareholders. This new network company would provide wholesale carriage services to all retail carriers on equal terms. Vertical integration would be at an end. This new network company would be a regulated utility with pricing guarantees that ensured that it received a reasonable return on its capital investment. It would know that as it invested more in its network it would receive an appropriate return. This is the model used for utilities used in other sectors such as water, gas and rail. This new network company would be mandated to rectify black spots in the cities and underserviced areas in regional and remote areas to ensure that all Australians had at least 12 megabits per second broadband. Schools and hospitals would be delivered price. faster broadband where it is not already available. As honourable members know, for the most part it is. Where this could not be done economically because of geography or historical network design choices, a transparent subsidy would be provided. Such an approach would achieve all of the policy goals referred to earlier. It would minimise the financial burden on taxpayers. It would ensure that our existing network was upgraded and improved over time in line with the demand for faster broadband. It would ensure that all Australians had access to broadband at a speed that is more than capable of handling the available applications. The government will say that anything less than fibre-to-the-home at 100 megabits per second is inadequate. Picking technologies is hard enough if you are in business. If you a government, you are sure to fail. Our policy for universal and affordable broadband should be technology agnostic. As for higher speeds, where they can be provided, no doubt they will be. And they already are being provided by the market. There is no evidence that households will pay a significant or any premium for such higher speeds, however. That has been the experience of telecommunications companies here and around the world. I note that in the United States the minimum broadband target is four megabits per second. We should never forget that speed is only of value to a customer to the extent that it enables that customer to use the particular applications that they want to. The 100 megabit per second fibre-to-the-home objective of the government has become little more than a religious devotion utterly unconnected from economics or market reality. To justify a $43 billion taxpayer investment, as the minister has done, on the basis that it will be used ‘in 20 years time for things that we do not know about' is reckless in the extreme. In 20 years time most of the equipment in the NBN will have been replaced, some of it several times. The refusal of the government to subject this NBN to a rigorous, independent cost benefit analysis represents one of the most disgraceful abdications of fiscal responsibility in our nation's history. Never has so much money been spent with so little scrutiny. I will not repeat to the House the many statements made by Labor ministers about the need for rigorous cost-benefit analysis of projects, but I remind the House that only two years ago the government established Infrastructure Australia with the express purpose of assessing major infrastructure projects. As part of that process of assessment, Infrastructure Australia stated in its 2009 guidelines for better infrastructure decision making: … all initiatives proposed to Infrastructure tralia … should include a thorough and detailed economic cost-benefit analysis … In order to demonstrate that the Benefit Cost Analysis is indeed robust, full transparency of the assumptions, parameters and values which are used in each Benefit Cost Analysis is required. Let me now turn to the detail of the legislation. As I said earlier, like the curate's egg is good in parts, but it also seeks to utterly subvert the normal operation of the Competition and Consumer Legislation Act, better known as the Trade Practices Act-the key national law protecting the interests of consumers with regard to this proposed $11 billion NBN-Telstra deal. It places a gun at the head of Telstra shareholders in the crudest possible fashion, with the government threatening to pull the trigger unless the firm separates the retail business and customer access network and migrates its customers to NBN Co. in the way the government has demanded. We oppose those measures. Therefore, we will be seeking to amend the bill in six areas, which I will discuss in greater detail shortly. Firstly, there is the matter of the separation of Telstra. One of the key objectives of the bill is a proposal by the government to require Telstra to voluntarily bring forward to the ACCC a plan to structurally separate its network and retail businesses. If it does not, or if the structural separation undertaking is not accepted, the current form of the bill requires Telstra to functionally separate-that is, divide its network and retail business units so that they operate at arm's length. The bill essentially provides ministerial discretion to prevent Telstra from bidding for next-generation 4G wireless spectrum via a disallowable instrument. It also provides ministerial discretion to compel Telstra to divest its HFC pay television cable network and/or 50 per cent interest in the AusFoxtel pay TV business. The gradual decommissioning of the Telstra copper customer access network and migration of Telstra customers to services provided over the NBN, contemplated in the agreement, would be accepted by the minister and the ACCC as a valid structural separation plan. The minister would have, under this legislation, the it discretion to direct the ACCC as to the criteria to be used in deciding whether to accept a separation plan. As we all understand, Telstra's vertical integration has been a contentious issue since the 1990s. Various options for separating Telstra's fixed line network from its retail and wireless businesses have been canvassed, and I discussed that earlier in my remarks. We support separation. We recognise that it would enhance competition. We have seen separation work effectively in other utility industries, such as energy and railways. We have also seen it improve telecommunications outcomes in other countries, including the UK and Sweden. Many people, both inside and outside Telstra, have argued for more than a decade that it was actually in the interests of Telstra shareholders to allow this to happen in order to promote greater shareholder value for Telstra. The decision of Telstra management over a long period of time to oppose this root and branch was, in the views of many, unwise. Given Telstra's current share price, it is hard to argue that existing approach or the previous approach has worked well for the company's 1.4 million shareholders or for its thousands of employees and millions of customers. So, as I said earlier, we welcome in principle Telstra separating into retail and network businesses. But we do not believe that such a separation should occur under duress or via a deal that is possibly in breach of the nation's competition laws or via the creation of a new and vastly wasteful government monopoly. Any such restructuring should be on terms such as those I described earlier which are fair to Telstra shareholders and impose no greater costs on taxpayers than are necessary. The NBN policy of the government does achieve structural separation, but at enormous and unnecessary cost to the taxpayer and via the establishment of a new government owned fixed line monopoly with which there will be no competition. One of the paradoxes of the current debate is that this structural separation of Telstra's network is cited by its competitors and the government as the greatest benefit of the NBN, yet there is absolutely no need to build a new network to achieve it. If vertical integration is the problem, then the NBN is using a sledgehammer-an extraordinarily expensive and elaborate sledgehammer at that, paid for by the taxpayer-to crack a nut. The second key objective of the bill is to exempt the proposed NBN-Telstra agreement-and no doubt NBN deals with other carriers such as Optus-from the normal operation of the Competition and Consumer Act, formerly known as the Trade Practices Act. This statutory authorisation for what otherwise would very likely be viewed as an anticompetitive arrangement is based on the government's argument that the proposed NBN-Telstra agreement is in the national interest. I say ‘anticompetitive' because the deal envisages Telstra being contractually the required to decommission its copper network, an asset that still has substantial if lessening economic value, as the NBN is rolled out to ensure that the latter enjoys a fixed line monopoly. It also envisages Telstra-and potentially Optus-being contractually forbidden from offering broadband and voice services over their pay TV networks, which pass about 30 per cent of Australian homes and could be tuned up to deliver speeds of over 100 megabits per second today-as, indeed, the HFC network of Telstra in Melbourne already has been tuned up to deliver. I recognise that it will be argued that, as the fibre-to-the-home overbuild progresses, the economics of the copper network will deteriorate to the point where it makes more sense to decommission it. That may be so, but the HFC network will not be decommissioned and will continue to provide pay TV services for many, many years to come. There is absolutely no justification for the ban on competition from the HFC network, other than to protect the economics of the NBN fixed line monopoly. The government's approach here is without precedent anywhere in the world. I was reading today a discussion delivered by one of the telco partners of Gilbert and  ourable member would be familiar with. He said, ‘The reaction of other countries to the NBN proposal was one of raised eyebrows and growing concern.' Indeed, only the other day one New Zealand businessman who is involved with that government's fibre rollout, where the government is spending $1.5 billion in total to support a public-private partnership to deliver fibre around New Zealand, said to me that the big difference between New Zealand's approach and Australia's was that, in New Zealand, the business plan came before the investment, whereas we seem to have made the investment decision and still have not got the business plan together. It is really becoming quite an embarrassment. The strictures we saw in the OECD report just underline how unprecedented the government's approach is. Nowhere else in the world is the government proposing to force a carrier to dismantle its copper network just to maximise revenues and eliminate competition for a government owned monopoly, regardless of the economic value of the existing network. Nowhere else in the world is broadband over copper, such as ADSL or VDSL, effectively being banned, regardless of whether it provides service of a quality and price that customers want. Nowhere else in the world is competition for fibre from HFC being banished, again, simply to prop up a government owned monopoly. On the contrary, broadband and voice delivered over HFC cables is the main form of facility based competition for copper and optical fibre in most countries in the world. Why on earth would this parliament believe the Australian government has this right and every other country in the world has it wrong? The OECD, as I have noted, is also critical of the way in which the NBN will be structured so as to be the sole provider of fixed-line communications to Australian households. ‘Facilities based competition is of great value,' the OECD writes in its economic survey of Australia, and I quote: Multiple empirical studies have stressed the value of competition between technological platforms for the dissemination of broadband services … And further: Moreover, such a monopolistic incumbentsuch as the NBNcould forestall the development of, as yet unknown, superior technological alternatives … Passage of this bill is not essential to completion of the Telstra-NBN Co. deal. It is not essential to the completion of the NBN. In fact, there is no need to do a deal with Telstra to have the NBN. That was certainly the government's policy and, indeed, what the MCKinsey implementation study also claimed. Telstra clearly believes it has pulled off an excellent deal here on the effective sale of its customer access network to the government. But the competition laws are not about protecting the interests of Telstra's shareholders or about maximising the revenues of the NBN Co - a government owned monopoly-or about permitting the Labor Party to turn back more than 20 years of economic reform; they are about protecting consumers and promoting competition. This deal, and the competition laws, should be dealt with by the ACCC, just like any other. It is also important to bear in mind that, when we talk about universal affordable broadband, there is a digital divide in Australia. Overwhelmingly, that divide is marked by income. Forty-three per cent of households with an income under $40,000 a year have internet at home. That figure rises to 76 per cent in households with an income of between $40,000 and $80,000 a year. In households with an income of between $80,000 and $120,000, 89 per cent have the internet and, in households with an income over $120,000, 95 per cent have the internet. The difference between the number of metro households and regional households having internet access at home is considerable-76 per cent in the cities, 64 per cent in the regions. But, overwhelmingly, the biggest marker of the digital divide is household income. The NBN will not bring down prices; it will put them up. It is going to be a massively overcapitalised, government owned monopoly with no competition. There will be an inevitable pressure on the management of the NBN to charge more. Indeed, notwithstanding that, over many years, we have seen prices of telecommunications come down again and again year after year, in the MCKinsey study we see, as expected, that the wholesale price for access to the NBN will increase in real terms every year for the next decade. That is a reversal. We have had telecommunications costs coming down, increased access to the internet but not enough to deliver anything near ubiquitous penetration among low-income households. So affordability is a big issue. What the government is doing is creating a scheme which will actually make the internet less affordable, so it is defeating one of the key objectives. The reality is that if you have an investment of this kind you will get one of two things or, more likely, both. You will get an inadequate return to the shareholder-in this case, the Australian taxpayer-or you will get the monopoly extracting monopolistically high prices for its services as a means of recovering on the investment. The truth is that, given the scale of this investment and the nature of the monopoly, you will probably get a bit of both. It will be a classic lose, lose-a lose for taxpayers and a lose for consumers. The third key area that the bill addresses is the regime governing competitive access to facilities such as Telstra's customer access network. This is really designed to deal with the interim stage before the NBN is built. The existing telecommunications access regime is widely seen to have been only partly effective, since Telstra has frequently been able to use the negotiate-arbitrate framework to delay and, in some cases, frustrate seekers of access. Telstra's board and management have responded to the regime in ways they believed maximised value to their shareholders, although in this regard I note and welcome the, if you like, less abrasive approach, the less confrontational approach of the current management. Telstra's competitors have accused the company of gaming the access regulations and, as a result, have sought a more predictable and less contentious regime. The bill amends the access regime included in the Competition and Consumer Act away from ‘negotiate/arbitrate' as a model for declared services to a new one where the ACCC sets upfront price and non-price terms for declared services for periods of three to five years. This has been described as a ‘set and forget' model to provide increased certainty for access seekers and carriers. But, in providing more certainty for Telstra's competitors, we need to be careful not to tip the balance too far and unfairly limit the scope for the company to appeal if the ACCC gets it wrong. Therefore we will be moving amendments which would restore merit reviews of ACCC part XIC decisions and reinstate the ACCC's procedural fairness obligations when issuing a competition notice under part XIB. Finally, the bill reinforces the existing consumer protection safeguards in the industry, including the universal service obligation and the customer service guarantee. While these changes place an increased burden on carriers, the coalition supports them and will not be moving amendments in this area. In particular, we believe it is critical for consumer protections to be meticulously upheld in rural and regional areas, where, as we all know, access to reliable communications services is critical. In summary, the coalition amendments would ensure that the normal operation of the Competition and Consumer Act, the key legislation in this country protecting the interests of consumers and promoting competition, applies to the NBN-Telstra deal. In other words, our amendments would ensure that this, the biggest merger in the telecommunications sector in our history-and the establishment of a government monopolyis not excluded from consideration by the ACCC under its powers under section 51. We would ensure that the parliament is able to disallow ministerial directions to the ACCC regarding the NBN-Telstra deal. We would restore merit reviews to ACCC enforcement of the new access pricing regime. We would restore procedural fairness to the ACCC enforcement of the new access regime. We would remove the ‘gun at the head' provisions which threaten Telstra with losing access to next-generation 4G wireless spectrum and remove the ‘gun at the head' provisions of the bill which threaten Telstra with being forced to dispose of its HFC pay television cables and/or 50 per cent interest in Foxtel if it does not structurally separate way acceptable to the government. These last two amendments will be moved as a single group of changes. The support for the coalition's position in this matter is growing all the time. I have referred to the remarks of the OECD. They are worth dwelling on because the OECD's report is normally-I think invariablywritten with the closest possible collaboration with the Treasury. It is very unusual for an OECD report of this kind to be as critical of a government's domestic policy as was the report published yesterday. It is quite common for the OECD to issue all sorts of exhortations to greater efforts in terms of economic reform, but to actually challenge a government policy is very rare. What the OECD has challenged most clearly and repeatedly is the way in which a monopoly is being created here. Its concern is considerable-and that, of course, is reflected in the advice the Treasury gave the incoming government in the red book, where it highlighted two major concerns. One was the obvious risk to the public balance sheet of investing $43 billion with no business case, no cost benefit analysis and no attempt ever to ask, ‘What are we trying to achieve?' and then, having defined that as universal and affordable broadband, ‘Is there a cheaper, speedier, more cost-effective way of achieving it, one that better promotes competition?' Those questions have never been asked by the government because they fear that the answer will not be to their liking. We have seen only today that the Alliance for Affordable Broadband, a group of leading competitive telcos including AAPT, PIPE Networks, Vocus, Ipera Communications and Allegro Networks-all leading players in the competitive telecommunications industryhave written an open letter to the Independent members of the House of Representatives which they have published. This is what they in a say, and it is a very pithy summary of the concerns that are being more and more shared across the country. The Alliance for Affordable Broadband write: We recognise that as a nation we already have some catching up to do to bring broadband services to many areas of Australia, particularly regional and remote areas. But, policy of this magnitude which carries with it fundamental changes to the entire fabric of the national telecommunications landscape and re-creates a new government owned monopoly requires Members of Parliament to ensure such a policy is the best policy for the future development of the country, and in particular the delivery of the most efficient investment by the Australian taxpayer. Past delays cannot justify panic or cut corners now. Mistakes we make in the design and/or policy settings for the proposed NBN, particularly in the areas of structure, affordability and accessibility, will not be easily fixed down the track and could be disastrous for our international competitiveness. You find yourselves in the position of being able to ensure the Government's policy is sound and that taxpayers' money is spent well and wisely. The Productivity Commission is experienced in doing this kind of analysis. It is well respected and credible because it is independent and rigorous and conducts its review transparently. It will approach the question independently and dispassionately, and present the facts. Facts are missing from this debate. This is a vast project that the government is undertaking. We support the objective of universal and affordable broadband, but we must achieve it in a way that protects and enhances competition and in a way that does not impose an utterly unnecessary burden on the Australian taxpayer and ultimately the households that will seek to access the internet through this network.",114
202,Ms ROWLAND,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I am very pleased to rise and speak in support of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010. I will address, firstly, some of the issues that have been raised by the member for Wentworth, who has come in here again and said that we all have the same objective. We do not, because on this side our objective is not a solution that would have been great in the year 2000, not 12 megabits per second. Our objective is universal, ubiquitous broadband that will last and that will drag us into the 21st century. I will say in relation to his notion that he has a new plan that it is very interesting. Yet again, I point out that this is the coalition's policyit is still on their website-and, if it is such a great idea to have the separate network company that he is proposing to set up, they had 12 years to do it. They had 12 years and they specifically dodged the issue, and all of a sudden it is a great idea. I will address some of the other issues at a later time with respect to the amendments and I look forward to reviewing those proposed amendments very closely. But one thing that made my ears prick up first of all was some ideas of reinstatement of merits review. If I recall, in 2002 the removal of merits review from a number of aspects of the negotiate-arbitrate model was specifiwhat is cally Howard government policy, enacted and supported by this side, because of the continual gaming of the regulatory system, locking things up in merits review in the Competition Tribunal for years. For years, things were banked-up in the Competition Tribunal. We never had lower prices. At times they should have been delivered because of this level of gaming, and yet we hear about merits review being reinstated. On the issue of the United States and some of the other countries that the member for Wentworth has mentioned, the last country I am going to take advice from on this point is the US. Here is a country with a minimum broadband target of four megabits per second and they have a regulator that has stepped back from wholesale regulation. When the rest of the world is pursuing wholesale regulation to ensure a competitive level playing field, the FCC is stepping back. It is a basket case in terms of competition. You go to regions in the US and you find they have no competition in broadband whatsoever. They have got a USO system that went bankrupt. The last people that I am going to take advice from is them-or maybe the second last, because New Zealand is a country that only a couple of years ago finally established telco-specific competition law. Do you know what they used to do when they had disputes? They used to go to the Privy Council-the Privy Council for God's sake! So the last people I am going to take advice from are these countries that the member for Wentworth has mentioned. He talks about what technology is going to be here in 20 years time. Well, unless someone wants to prove me wrong, in 20 years time, nothing is going to get faster the speed of light. Once you lay the fibre networks the only things you need to replace are the electronics on the end. You have the backbone there that will last far more than 20 years, far more than this mishmash of a bit of wi-fi, a bit of copper. It is still copper-you can keep upgrading it but it is still copper. The member for Wentworth talks about facilities based competition. Hasn't that worked in Australia! The market really has delivered on that point. The member for Bradfield came in here the other week and said that the market should be able to deliver competition. Note to self: it has not. If you look at any report in Australia about the state of competition, facilities based competition has been non-existent for years. Yet he comes into this place and says that the market will deliver and that, yes, we have a digital divide. We do have a digital divide but, yet again, what did the opposition do when they were in government to address it? Enlighten me. I wish to be enlightened because I know the answer is sweet nothing. I say to members opposite: do not come in here and preach to me about affordability; do not come in here and preach to me when we have got whole areas of the Blacktown local government area that are white on maps of internet penetration-where there is simply no internet. That is what was delivered under the previous government. The way that you deal with this is through retail competition delivered only through a wholesale openaccess model, delivering pricing that actually drives competition at the retail level. As a former practitioner in this area, involved in countless inquiries into how the regulatory system in Australia works, countless inquiries into parts XIB and XIC of the Trade Practices Act. At the end of it, even after all the reforms that occurred since 1991, the thing that we have to deal with is that it is still an inadequate system to deal than with a broadband future. ICT, being the driver of total factor productivity, needs fundamental reform of the telco sector in order to work. This is an historic piece of legislation that addresses some of the fundamental problems that have plagued the telco sector since liberalisation of the industry commenced in 1991. There are many parts to this bill, and I will provide some context, but in the time. I have I will concentrate on some specific aspects. In 2001, the Productivity Commission released its report into telco-specific competition law. It investigated the need to establish a regulatory regime that would be relevant and robust for the future telecommunications environment and that would enhance overall community welfare. This was a two-year, very wide-ranging process and, as members would be aware, this led to the implementation of the Telecommunications Competition Bill 2002. Although the Productivity Commission recommendations and the subsequent legislative changes were significant, one cannot help but lament that this was a lost opportunity to implement reforms that would have led to the structural separation of Telstra's wholesale and retail sectors. At the time, I did indeed lament that this was a lost opportunity. As I noted in 2004 when I discussed ICT policy in Australia-A failure to converge, a failure to recognise convergence or a failure to care?-following on the conference of the World Summit on the Information Society, which was held in Geneva in late 2003, I questioned whether Australia actually had an I was ICT policy that was comparable with the WSIS outcomes. It led me to the conclusion that Australia did not have an ICT strategy at all at a federal level. I concluded by arguing that Australia's failure to adopt a coherent ICT strategy resulted in ICT policy settings that were inappropriate and unsustainable. I was proved right that these were wasted years. These were years when we should have been laying the policy ground work for a high-speed broadband network to actually make sure that Australia did not fall behind other countries in our region. I mentioned that the opposition, when in government, specifically dodged the issue of structural separation. Do not take it from me, take it from the Productivity Commission's terms of reference. The terms of reference specified that, in line with government policy, the inquiry would not encompass the structural separation of Telstra. So the Howard government failed to enact, failed to even look at, a much needed microeconomic reform that would have laid the foundation for the rollout of a national broadband network. That is just one example of the total disregard for broadband by the government of that time. They did not believe in it then, they do not believe it now and their act on regulatory reform and broadband policy has hurt Australia's global performance. Do not take it from me, take it from the facts. The member for Wentworth talks about the OECD. We are ranked 17th out of 31 OECD countries in terms of fixed broadband uptake; we are ranked 50th for broadband speeds. We do not even have one city in all of Australia in the top 100 in the world for broadband speeds. Unless we build the NBN, there is absolutely no way we will be able to increase our international competitiveness. We will just keep falling behind. Only recently a broadband quality survey saw Australia fall from 18th to 21st in the world broadband rankings. As I said, what we really need to do is to understand what the NBN is: a fibre network which, once laid, will enable smart electronics at each end to use those pipes in a way that we cannot predict. We have not even imagined yet what those things will be able to do, but the most important thing is that the backbone will be there so that when these applications are invented you can use the pipes for whatever purpose you seek. When we talk about being technically agnostic, I agree we should be talking about being technically agnostic-at the ends. Who am I to argue with the physics of the speed of light, of an electromagnetic pulse going down this conduit? What frustrates me, and what I know frustrates people all over my electorate-and I know so many people who have been following this debate-is how Australia is constantly not held up as one of the countries that can boast about what it has done in broadband. I refer to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald last Wednesday, 10 November, which talked about Korea. Korea, of course, has been in the news, and I think this is an excellent article. As it says: We can learn a lot about broadband networks failure to from this Asian powerhouse … … … … While Australia debates the merits of the broadband network, South Korea resolved to provide widespread high-speed internet more than a decade ago and now tops the world in broadband access. Just like education or high-speed rail, broadband is viewed as another type of infrastructure that gives the economy an edge. It gives the economy an edge. It is not good enough for a modern, innovative and competitive economy that Australia is doing so badly. Essentially, we got liberalisation right in the late eighties and early nineties. We had an independent regulator. We set up the current policy settings to be able to have different pieces of legislation to enable competition, to let in new players and to ensure that in the end we had an open carrier model here in Australia. But one thing we did not get right was that, from the mid-nineties onwards, it was as though convergence never happened. It is as though we did not end up thinking we needed an ICT policy. This progress that we see in our region is not going to happen in Australia of its own accord. We need to execute fundamental reform, and that is why this legislation is so important. It is overdue. It has been discussed for nearly two decades, but this is reform that will transfer Australia from the deficiencies of the 20th century regulatory structure to a regulatory structure for the 21st century. It will create much-needed infrastructure competition in the telco sector-infrastructure competition that simply has not happened and will not happen. It is reform that ensures we do not commit the mistakes of the past when it comes to the regulation of telecommunications in Australia. This bill will be part of shaping the regulatory regime that will be applied to the NBN. By implementing structural separation of Telstra, this legislation deals with the greatest outstanding reform of our telco sector whilst providing the basis for the NBN to operate as an open access model. The open access model is essential for the delivery of faster, more affordable broadband services. I do not just speak as a former practitioner in this area. I also speak as an effective representative of my residents, and I would like to mention Mr Glen Meeves, who lives in Kings Park in my electorate of Greenway. He is well aware of the benefits of the NBN. In a letter recently published in the Sydney Morning Herald, he noted: … lightning-fast broadband … is also a matter of social justice and equity. We cannot build the finest educational and medical facilities in population centre, but world's best practice in internet makes the physical absence irrelevant. I totally agree with that. I would also like to talk about the inability of the previous government to keep up with what has been needed for so long by new residents in greenfields estates. I have recently received this email from a resident who has moved into a new development in the north of my electorate called The Ponds. She wrote: We are new residents in the new development of The Ponds and have been told by Telstra, Optus, iiNet and TPG that we cannot get broadband internet at all … It also baffles me that my house has been built next to a house in Kellyville Ridge which has been there for 5 years now, yet I cannot get broadband internet even though I am literally next door! It is a disgrace that, as with so many forms of critical infrastructure that have bypassed greenfield developments in the past, policymakers in Australia have to date failed to undertake proper planning for the future communications needs of residents in our growth suburbs. What did those opposite do to address this when in government? What forward planning did they do? Again, it was sweet nothing. There was no ICT policy. It was 12 years in the digital backwaters. The convergence debate came and went and we just watched it go by. I also note that the reforms in this bill are supported by Telstra. I refer the House to a media release issued by Telstra's CEO, David Thodey, in which he states: … we support the passage of the Bill … We believe the interests of Telstra shareholders would be best served by the Bill being passed this year so that a definitive agreement on our involvement in the NBN can be reached quickly. I am happy to take that on board as well. It is certainty that the sector needs. Indeed, this is the level of certainty that the sector needs in every order to ensure that we have broadband delivered in a ubiquitous manner on a level playing field. In the time allotted to me, I cannot go into all the details of many of the other very important elements of this bill such as reforms to the USO, the CSG or the infringement penalty regime. Certainly they are very important. I have been in touch with consumer groups on many occasions on these points. They should be very well received and I commend the bill to the House.",121
203,Mr HARTSUYKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010. This bill has three aspects to it. Firstly, its provisions will the structural separation of Telstra by providing for the legislative changes required to allow the separation. The bill also details how the government will impose sanctions against Telstra if it fails to voluntarily strucbroadband turally separate. Secondly, the legislation makes a number of provisions in the Competition and Consumer Act which relate to the telecommunications access regime. In particular, the ACCC will be provided with the power to declare minimum prices and nonprice terms in access agreements, which the parties may fall back on until the parties to an access agreement can negotiate different terms. The third aspect of the bill relates to the consumer protection regulation. Given that Telstra are migrating their fixed line customers to the NBN, there will be a transitional period with regard to the universal service obligation. The government will create a new service corporation called USO Co. to deliver the universal service obligation. This bill provides that the USO provider must supply, on request, standard telephone services with characteristics and to performance standards determined by the minister. These performance standards are intended to include maximum periods for new connections, fault rectification and reliability standards. However, like the majority of telecommunications legislation introduced by this government, the minister is given excessive freedom to implement standards without the scrutiny of parliament. This legislation was first introduced in the last parliament and sought to force the structural separation of Telstra by denying it from acquiring specific bands of spectrum and requiring Telstra to divest itself of its HFC cable network and its interest in Foxtel. That bill demonstrated the extent to which the government is willing to disrupt the teleallow communications industry in order to force through its National Broadband Network. Labor was willing to use strongarm tactics against one of the largest companies in Australia in order to push through its flawed policies. Telstra is now a publicly listed company. It has 1.4 million shareholders, 30,000 employees and 9 million customers. Attempts by the government to pressure Telstra were nothing more than an attack on the interests of those Australians who have invested in or purchased Telstra services in good faith. Against this backdrop, and with a gun to their head, Telstra negotiated an $11 billion deal with the government that will see Telstra's fixed line customers migrate to the NBN and will provide NBN Co. with access to Telstra's passive infrastructure such as pits, ducts and backhaul fibre. The agreement will eliminate Telstra as a fixed line wholesale competitor to the NBN. As such, this bill has been modified to allow the voluntary separation of Telstra's wholesale interests to proceed after shareholder approval. The bill still allows the minister to deny spectrum to Telstra if the proposed $11 billion agreement is not finalised. If the agreement fails, Telstra will be forced to functionally separate by conducting its network operations and wholesale functions at arm's length from the rest of Telstra under threat of loss of access to 4G spectrum. The coalition recognises that Telstra is now committed to the migration of fixed line customers, which amounts to a structural separation for the purposes of this bill. However, we do not agree with the government's use of strongarm tactics against Telstra in order to force structural separation. Any separation must occur on terms that balance the interests of Telstra's shareholders with the public interest. The willingness of Labor to completely remove competition to the NBN and to avoid scrutiny of the NBN's operations is a dangerous approach to the industry that will not result in the most efficient services for broadband users. After more than a decade of government policy encouraging infrastructure based competition, the Gillard government is systematically preventing any competitive threats to NBN Co.'s wholesale network. The industry recognises that Labor is setting up a monopoly and that this will destroy competition in the wholesale fixed line market. In its submission to the ACCC on NBN Co.'s points of interconnect proposals, Optus said: It will not be economically viable for alternate last mile fibre based networks to be deployed in competition to the NBN … policy settings are likely to need to be re-set to discourage alternate investments in last mile fixed fibre access. This fact is implicitly recognised in the recent Telstra/NBN Co heads of Agreement which effectively removes the opportunity for Telstra to compete with the NBN either on its HFC or copper networks. The current copper network is able to provide broadband speeds of up to 24 megabits per second to around 93 per cent of the population. Telstra's HFC cables can provide speeds of up to 100 megabits per second. The majority of regular households in Australia only require a fraction of those speeds. NBN Co.'s first release sites in Tasmania are only experiencing an 11 per cent take-up of speeds of higher than 25 megabits per second. Labor's solution to decommission or effectively prevent alternative broadband infrastructure from competing with fibre is simply unbelievable and flies in the face of the principle that competition is a key driver for better services and lower prices. Both sides of the House recognise that broadband services need to be improved in regional and rural areas in Australia. However, only the coalition believes that instead of ripping up existing networks across Australia we should be targeting those regional areas first and improving their services first. We should be hitting the black spots in those areas where broadband is delivered at high cost to consumers. If Labor continued the coalition's OPEL scheme when the government took office, those regional areas would currently be serviced by broadband speeds comparable with the rest of Australia. It is the Labor government who has delayed improved broadband services for regional Australia through its communications policy failures and still they have not been able to find a solution that is acceptable to the market, which will be left with a wholesale company far more monopolised than Telstra's copper network. In its report on Australia issued yesterday, the OECD was very critical regarding the market impacts of the NBN. The OECD said that the heads of agreement signed with Telstra eliminated competition between the new fibre optic network and the existing technological platforms, and that this: … implies a de facto restoration of a public monopoly over the supply of access to wholesale internet services. The OECD report goes on to say that: … such a monopolistic incumbent could forestall the development of, as yet unknown, superior technological alternatives. These comments are similar to those made by the company rolling out the government's backhaul black spots program-Nextgen Networks-in response to the government's plans on locating NBN points of interconnect only in the capital cities. Nextgen told the ACCC last week: - In the short term, competition will be impacted immediately. RSPs are already reassessing their business models and deciding whether to operate within cost structures based on maintaining network assets or adopting a resale only model where they rely entirely on the NBNCo facilities. … … … In the long term, competition will be structurally and irreversibly undermined. I will repeat that: ‘structurally and irreversibly undermined'. The explanatory memorandum for this bill argues that Telstra has been the main impediment against the competitive telecommunications sector. The memorandum states that: … Telstra has been able to maintain a dominant position in virtually all aspects of the market, despite more than 10 years of open competition. It is the Government's view that Telstra's high level of integration has hindered the development of effective competition in the sector. Given these concerns, it is worrying that the government's solution is to create a monopoly with far more market power in the fixed line wholesale sector than Telstra currently enjoys. As Telstra pointed out to the ACCC last week: … access seekers, in effect, swap Telstra as the sole supplier of backhaul for NBN Co as the sole supplier of backhaul. As limited as the prospects might seem today, access seekers also forfeit ture competition because NBN Co's bundling of its monopoly access product with the backhaul will foreclose any future competition. Surely a better approach would be to encourage the structural separation of Telstra in order to improve competition, rather than creating a new monopoly shielded from market forces. This is why the coalition believes that all aspects of the NBN must be scrutinised by independent experts and by parliament. In its pattern of avoiding scrutiny, the government has excluded the $11 billion deal between Telstra and NBN Co. from investigation by the ACCC. This comes after Labor's exclusion of the NBN from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and its refusal to complete a cost-benefit analysis. The coalition is currently attempting to ensure that the rollout is overseen by a joint standing committee of parliament. Refusing to allow the ACCC to examine Telstra's deal will prevent an informed debate around the future competitive environment of broadband and allow the industry to raise any concerns about the deal. Importantly, the parliament needs a better understanding of what the deal will mean for competition and broadband services in rural and regional areas. If we are serious about improving services in regional areas, the coalition believes that NBN Co. must provide as much detail about how it is rolling out its regional services as possible and what that rollout means for regional markets. As we all know, the Rudd-Gillard government has a long list of failed interventions in markets. Given its history, how can anyone trust how this government will spend $43 billion on a national broadband network? After so many failures, Labor is so worried about the NBN's viability that it is removing competitive threats and refusing independent and parliamentary scrutiny. The forced migration fu- of Telstra's copper network contained in this bill, the blackmail against Telstra and the exemption of Telstra's agreement with NBN Co. are further examples of this government's efforts to shield the NBN from competition. Therefore, the coalition will move a number of amendments in an attempt to ensure that the migration of Telstra's copper network to NBN Co. proceeds in a responsible and fair manner. These amendments build on the constructive approach the coalition is taking on the NBN. We have also introduced legislation and moved a motion to provide parliamentary scrutiny about the NBN's rollout and to ensure that an independent cost-benefit analysis is completed with a business plan. The amendments to be moved by the coalition aims to improve four areas of the legislation. Firstly, we will ensure that the Competition and Consumer Act applies to the proposed deal between NBN Co. and Telstra. Secondly, we will ensure that parliament is able to disallow any ministerial directions to the ACCC regarding the NBN Co. and Telstra deal. Thirdly, merit reviews and procedural fairness will be restored to the ACCC enforcement of the new access-pricing regime. Finally, the coalition will remove the ‘gun to the head' provisions of this bill which threaten Telstra with losing access to 4G wireless spectrum, as well as its interests in the HFC television cables and Foxtel. The coalition strongly believes that this transparency can help ensure the NBN rollout targets regional areas first and ensures that services are improved in these areas first. As I have outlined, it is critical for the dustry and taxpayers that the sector benefits from the efficiency that maximum competition provides. Ensuring ACCC oversight of the Telstra deal will improve transparency. Parliament must also be able to disallow ministerial directions given to the ACCC with regard to this deal. The powers being given to the minister on communications policy by this government are extraordinary and parliament must exercise some oversight. Attempts to structurally separate Telstra must proceed with fairness to its shareholders, employees and customers. This is why the coalition will remove the provisions which place a gun to the head of Telstra unless it structurally separates. As with the coalition's other attempts to improve the NBN rollout process, we believe that broadband is too important to Australia, and to regional areas in particular, for it to be left in the hands of this Labor executive that has rolled out programs so poorly in its first term. The whole NBN process has been one of the government's avoiding scrutiny at all costs. The disastrous policy failures of this government's first term demonstrate the need for as much scrutiny as possible. Our amendments to this bill will improve scrutiny by protecting the role of the ACCC and will ensure that Telstra's structural separation is not left in the hands of this Labor government. I urge the Senate to accept the coalition's amendments and improve this legislation to encourage a fairer and more transparent NBN rollout in which the Australian people can have confidence.",125
204,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"My poor old heart bleeds for poor old Telstra. Poor old coalition: too little for too long and now it is too late. This feigned interest by the coalition in bringing us to scrutiny, in having the parliament as the chamber of expertise to look through every clause and subclause of this legislation, beggars belief. I inthink those opposite are on to telecommunications plan No. 20, and that tells a story of its own. We on this side have a plan and we are actually getting on with it. Believe it or not, even Telstra believes that this is the way to go. It finally understands that this is the way to go if it is to have a future. Twelve months ago I rose in this place to speak on the previous version of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010. A lot has changed on the issue in that time, except of course the negativity of those opposite towards our vision of the fibre future, a vision shared by many thousands of Australians. Indeed, this negativity has intensified with the member for Wentworth being specifically assigned with the job of ‘destroying the NBN'. That is the coalition's idea of policy development. At the time, I said this was about the ability of people, businesses and institutions of all sorts to have universal and comprehensive access to 21st century communications systems-and that remains unchanged. In that year we also saw some tremendous progress on the ground, particularly in my electorate, with the rollout of the first stage of the National Broadband Network, starting as it did at Smithton in the Circular Head region. Let me remind those opposite that this was the pioneering of the rollout. People do indeed have contractual obligations to other providers, but I remind those opposite that people are interested in signing up for the NBN and, as it rolls out, it will gather its own momentum. Equally important was the landmark heads of agreement between Telstra and the NBN Co. made in June this year, which will encourage a much more cooperative approach to the future of telecommunications in Australia. Indeed, this legislation is specifically tory. designed to allow this to happen. Another factor is that with the return of the Gillard Labor government comes the continued resolution to roll out its visionary NBN plan. worth reiterating this at this stage because its characteristics are at the heart of the tion. First and foremost, the NBN is a fibre-to the-premises network. The Australian government has established a government business enterprise-NBN Co. Ltd-to design, build and operate an open access network, providing download speeds of up to one gigabit per second to 93 per cent of Australian homes and businesses, for which it is offering to contribute an initial cash injection of up to $43 billion. The remaining homes and businesses will be supplied using wireless and satellite technologies. The National Broadband Network will be built with the following characteristics. The network is to be operational progressively over eight years as a government business enterprise. It must be able to provide highquality voice data and video services, including symmetric services such as highdefinition video conferencing. The network is expected to cost about $26 billion, with the government issuing infrastructure bonds to allow private investment in the network. This will be capped at 49 per cent. The network is to be open access and have a uniform pricing structure regardless of customer location. The Australian government will hold a 51 per cent share and will operate the network for at least 10 years once completed before selling down their stake, although there is debate about whether the network should be sold. It is estimated that it will create 47,000 new jobs over the next eight years and will support 25,000 jobs every year until completed. The NBN will be the largest single infrastructure investment in Australia's hisWork on the rollout in my home state began in July 2009 and the first services went live on 1 July 2010. Indeed, the Circular It is Head Christian School in my electorate was part of the very first transmission. Crucially, legislaon 20 June 2010 Telstra signed a nonbinding agreement to participate in the National Broadband Network rollout, and the revamped legislation before us gives effect to this. As I say, the National Broadband Network will be the largest single infrastructure investment in Australia's history, with enormous potential benefits for the nation. Better, faster and cheaper internet services will allow Australia to be at the forefront of the digital economy in the digital world. The new network will have a profound importance for Australia's productivity and the ability of Australian businesses to thrive in a fiercely competitive world. It will help transform the way governments and nongovernment agencies deliver services, especially in health and education, and the way we communicate and entertain ourselves in our personal lives. I am excited about its potential, for example, for families with autistic children. Burnie in my electorate is one of six sites chosen throughout the nation to network intensive autistic services in Tasmania and is already underway in doing so. The NBN will allow families to video access the centre from their own living rooms and hence access early, intensive therapy and services so vital in giving autistic children the start they need to tackle their individual needs. The NBN can also eliminate the communications disadvantages of country and regional areas and render them more attractive as business and employment locations. However, as this legislation bears out, it is imperative that Australia get it right and get it right from the start. Getting it right is not just about getting the best technology, as important as that is; the real challenge will be putting in place the right rules to govern how the network will operate. Those rules must ensure the network is run in a way that encourages competition and innovation in the downstream services provided by communications retailers. I mentioned earlier that the NBN is opposed by the coalition. A week prior to the 2010 Australian federal election, the coalition released a $6.25 billion alternative policy, relying on a combination of public and private funding to build a primarily wireless network delivering a minimum peak speed of 12 megabits per second to 97 per cent of the Australian population. The plan included $3.5 billion to be spent developing an open access, optical fibre backhaul network. It was not long before the so-called alternative policy was criticised by the general telecommunications industry, with executives describing it as one that ‘harked back to an earlier era', ‘lacked vision' and was ‘muddy and unclear'. As one ISP CEO put it, ‘What policy?' After the 2010 election, the member for Wentworth was appointed opposition communications spokesman, with the mission ‘to destroy the NBN'. I notice too that the opposition's spokesperson on telecommunications was promptly sacked after the election and plonked on the back bench. That is how much integrity those opposite placed on their policy during the last election. The Australian people woke up to it, particularly further south and in rural and regional Australia. Apart from the opposition and some naysayers in the conservative commentariat, there is overwhelming support for Labor's NBN policy across a whole array of sectors and the Australian population. David Thodey, for example, the CEO of Telstra, was reported in the Australian on 20 October as saying: in We believe the interests of Telstra shareholders would be best served by the bill being passed this year so that a definitive agreement on our involvement in the NBN can be reached quickly. On 19 August 2010, the Australian Internet Industry Association issued a statement supporting the NBN, outlining the problems of a proposed alternative based on wireless networks and criticising the comparative speed of broadband in Australia, saying it is: … not a ‘nice to have', it's an essential part of a modern economy. I do not need to remind this House, as I have at other times, about our poor record on internet services, delivery, speeds and expansiveness, or lack of it, compared to our overseas competitors. In the past decade Australia's internet use has grown by a staggering 12,000 per cent, with the rate quickly accelerating. Yet despite this, as the association pointed out, Australia is ranked 50th in the world for our average broadband speeds. I noticed on 21 September this year that Telstra announced that it was signing on to be a provider of services under the NBN, launching a trial in Tasmania to test the compatibility of its broadband service and digital products with the NBN. Within this parliament itself, the NBN has the support of the Greens and a number of the Independents. Indeed, the members for Lyne and New England cited the NBN as one of the key reasons they decided to back the Gillard government. I remind those listening to this debate that on 7 September during negotiations concerning who might form a minority government, the member for New England, Tony Windsor, said of the NBN, ‘You do it once, you do it right and you do it with fibre.' The member for Kennedy, the Independent Mr Bob Katter, was similarly reported as agreeing that the national grid and NBN ‘are a good thing for this country, a great thing for this country'. And support is also relatively strong amongst the technology sector. Optus has viewed Labor's win at the last election as an endorsement for the long-term NBN solution, as well as endorsement for the need for an overhaul of the current regulatory structure in Australia. Optus supports the legislation before us. Indeed, as Optus's Director of Government and Corporate Affairs, Mr Krishnapillai, asserts: We believe that the telco reform billincluding the structural separation of Telstra the greater power for the ACCC to enforce a level playing field in the fixed line market-must be a priority for the new government. Hence this legislation before the House. In an interview with the radio station 2UE in Sydney on 13 October, Mr Krishnapillai made it very clear that the NBN would be affordable to customers, saying: We have done a lot of modelling on this, we've been through NBN Mark 1, we've been through years of modelling and work on this with the government and we know that the NBN, as it is characterised now, is commercially viable. He went on to say: … in the longer term the NBN is the right solution for the sector, it's the right solution to deliver broadband and transform, if you like, how communications are delivered to customers and businesses. I think Google Engineering's Alan Noble put it best when he wrote Opportunities of the NBN for the ABC on 18 October 2010. He said: The National Broadband Network will be the digital equivalent of the Trans-Australian Railway: linking towns small and large, bringing new life and new opportunities to our economy and our communities. He further said: … so too will a super-fast broadband network bring a freight train of innovation to our shores. The legislation before us seeks to overcome the restrictions created by the dominance of one player in the telecommunications market. If passed, this will represent the most significant reform of the telecommunications regime since open competition was introduced in 1997. I know everyone in this House fully understands the need for that change. Structural reform is clearly in the national interest. The bill includes provisions to authorise, for the purposes of section 51 of and the Competition and Consumer Act, conduct by Telstra and NBN Co. relating to Telstra's structural separation undertaking. However, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will make the final decision on acceptance of Telstra's undertaking to structurally separate. Amongst other provisions the bill provides for Telstra's structural separation undertaking to include a migration plan. There will be significant consultation on the migration plan, which will deal with the processes and timing of migrating Telstra's customers from its copper network to the NBN. The bill now provides more legislative certainty for Telstra in the transition a retail company. (Time expired)",128
205,Mr FLETCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Bradfield) (5.57 pm)I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010 and I do so with a great deal of interest, having been fortunate to work in the field of communications policy since the mid-nineties, starting with a number of years working for the Howard government's first communications minister, Senator Richard Alston. I well remember the furious round of work involved in passing the 1997 legislation. The bill that is before the House today seeks to in some ways continue the theme of reform which underpinned the 1997 legislation, but in other ways regrettably very much reverses that direction of reform. This bill is a mix of good and bad. I want to make three key points in the time that is available to me. The part of this bill that deals with changes to the current arrangements for setting wholesale access prices in the telecommunications sector is, in my view, sensible. The approach that it takes is one that I support and I will talk about that at more length. The second area of this bill grants in effect a legislative authorisation of the proposed deal between Telstra and NBN Co. The bill includes the powers under which the minister can visit a whole series of undesirable consequences upon Telstra if that deal is not given effect to. I am somewhat curious to wonder why those provisions are actually included when you look at the triumphant press release issued by the minister earlier this year giving the impression that a deal had been done and all was agreed. It does rather raise the question why this set of draconian powers is required. What is particularly troubling is the strong impression which is given that Minister Conroy has an to Orwellian belief that competition is so precious that we must destroy it, because that is the clear impression that emerges when you consider what is contemplated. The third set of comments I wish to make concerns the provisions I have mentioned that give the minister the power to visit some very detrimental consequences upon Telstra if it does not voluntarily put forward a structural separation undertaking. I put to the House that this is a clumsy, thuggish and unnecessary tool to achieve the stated objectives of the Labor government's telecommunications policy. I will start with the changes that this bill includes to current price regulation in the telecommunications sector. I bring to my appraisal of these provisions the experience of having spent eight years on the senior leadership team at Optus. Optus is the largest purchaser of services from Telstra, spending over $1 billion a year on such services as PSTN originating and terminating access, mobile terminating access, local carriage service and the unconditioned local loop service. It formed part of my responsibilities at Optus to manage the process by which we sought to negotiate with Telstra and, then, should the negotiations fail, go to the ACCC to seek to have the matter arbitrated. This is what is referred to as the negotiate/arbitrate model. There is a fundamental problem with the negotiate/arbitrate model, which is that Telstra does not like selling these services. The company takes the view, I think correctly, that its market position would be considerably stronger if it were not required to sell these services and it therefore drags its feet at every opportunity. I would like to share with the House a quote from Dr Phil Burgess, the former American senior regulatory executive, who blazed across the telecommunications night sky like a comet-a comet which fortunately has now blazed all the way back to the United States of America. While he was here throwing out provocative quotations in every direction, he had this to say: If MCDonald's … has to go to a regulator before it goes into business and declare what it's going to do on its ovens … and Hungry Jacks comes across the street and says, “I want to buy those fish sandwiches, by the way, at a discounted price, and, by the way, I get the first batch. I'm going to sell a lot of them and if you want more, you've got to build another oven. By the way, you build the oven at your own expense. By the way, the cost of the air-conditioning and the gas and the electricity and the lights, those don't go into the price.” I have not captured the fierce intensity, the passion, with which Dr Phil Burgess expressed the intense dislike of Telstra for the access provisions. But the fact is the company strongly disliked those provisions and the economic reality is, I believe, that it did so because it considered that those provisions weakened its market power. And of course those provisions were expressly designed to weaken its market power. I had this to say when I wrote a book about this topic, called Wired Brown Land: The 1997 laws were fine in theory. Subjecting Telstra to an access regime was a good idea. But in practice there was a very big problem: the laws were simply not tough enough in the way that they dealt with the giant of the sector, Telstra. The laws established a process for Telstra's competitors to use Telstra's network, but the process is fundamentally flawed. It assumesincorrectly-goodwill and a willingness to negotiate on the part of both parties. But Telstra has no such willingness. Its interest is best served by charging the highest possible prices for access, by denying access wherever possible and by delaying for as long as possible the agreement of terms on which access will be provided. That is my considered view, having worked for eight years as the executive at Optusthe largest customer of Telstra-responsible for exercising the rights of that company under the access regime to purchase services from Telstra. I have mentioned that I was working for the Howard government when those laws were introduced and I simply say that all of us have learnt from experience. The laws were introduced with very good intentions and I certainly believe that the 1997 legislation moved the position forward considerably. But experience showed us that those price-setting provisions in the 1997 legislation were not sufficient. What was in fact required, we learnt over time, was a capacity for the regulator to set prices upfront-what is known in other markets as a reference interconnect offer. I have no hesitation in congratulating the present government on including within this legislation provisions that will now give the regulator that power. I believe they will significantly advance the cause of telecommunications competition. Turning to the second area that I want to address, unfortunately, what I cannot congratulate this government on is the deeply regrettable parliamentary tactic of linking the provisions about which I have just spokenthe provisions that will modernise and reform the price-setting process-to a set of wholly unrelated provisions. The unrelated provisions are aimed at implementing and legalising Labor's deeply flawed vision of establishing a new government owned monopoly network, forcing Telstra to exit the field, destroying its existing network and establishing a legally binding contract between Telstra and NBN under which this will happen. That legally binding contract, extraordinarily, would be illegal under the Trade Practices Act were it not for the fact that the government proposes to specifically authorise it under the piece of legislation that is now before this House. For example, section 45 of the Trade Practices Act says: (2) A corporation shall not: (a) make a contract or arrangement, or arrive at an understanding, if: … … … (ii) a provision of the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding has the purpose, or would have or be likely to have the effect, of stantially lessening competition; … And that is precisely the likely effect of the deal that the Labor Party is proposing in the broadband sphere. It is a deal under which a new entrant into this sector, funded by the government, funded by taxpayers, the National Broadband Network Company, is going to build a new access network and at the same time do a deal with the owner of the existing ubiquitous access network, Telstra, under which Telstra will decommission its existing network-Telstra will trash its existing access network. That existing access network will no longer be available as a vehicle over which competitive services are delivered. Labor does not want to put this grubby deal to the normal scrutiny which would be required, of having the ACCC consider it and determine whether it is compliant with the Trade Practices Act. Why is that? Because this government knows full well that it would not be compliant. We have the extraordinary scenario in which this government is abandoning the direction of policy of the last two decades in telecommunications, abandoning two decades of commitment to increasing competition and instead is establishing the National Broadband Network Co. as a monopolist and thereby doing fundamental damage to competition, all so it can preserve its stated policy that the National Broadband Network Co. will generate a positive financial return. The third area of this bill I want to address is the provisions which encourage Telstra to come forward with a structural separation undertaking. These provisions are troubling on many fronts. They are troubling because of the duplicity we have seen from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, who in May 2009 said to a Senate estimates committee that he had subnever advocated the structural separation of Telstra. Senator Conroy said: I have certainly never advocated structural separation, I do not believe. Yet suddenly late last year provisions appeared in the legislation which were designed to elicit structural separation. I am on the record as being a supporter of structural separation. The Prime Minister has seen fit to quote extracts from a work I wrote about this very topic. She failed, I might add, to quote later parts of the very same book in which I suggested: The third option is to stop negotiating and to exercise the government's legislative powers. Under this option the government would pass legislation to separate Telstra into two companies. There is no mention of $43 billion, no mention of the grubby deals under which legislation is required to give this new government owned company a special free pass protecting it from competition. Let me be perfectly clear: I am certainly a supporter of structural separation, but, as Malcolm Turnbull, the member for Wentworth, the shadow minister for communications, has repeatedly made the point, there is no reason to spend $43 billion if your objective is to secure the outcome that you prevent vertical integration by separating Telstra into two entities under different ownership. What we have here is a set of provisions which are designed in a thuggish way to force Telstra into agreeing to structural separation arrangements and at the same time to pay $11 billion of taxpayers' money to give Telstra incentive to do that. We have the remarkable spectacle of a minister for broadband and communications rejoicing in the fact that he is going to have a monopoly. In Senate estimates just the other week, what did Senator Conroy say? He said: We will, as I have said-particularly following the heads of agreement with Telstra-ultimately have the overwhelming majority of if not the nopoly on the supply of the wholesale network within the fibre footprint, unless people decide they do not want a fixed line. What a tragic outcome for telecommunications competition in Australia this is, that after two decades of bipartisan work towards greater competition in telecommunications, which has delivered manifest benefits in mobile communications, which has delivered significant, albeit lesser, benefits in fixedline communications, we now have a minister for communications in this country who has reversed that direction and who is positively rejoicing, positively rubbing his hands in glee, at the prospect that he is going to be the controlling shareholder of a monopoly, a company which has, by force of legislative power, the right to exclude any competitor. My prediction is this: based upon all the experience of a wholly owned government monopolist in telecommunications that Australia has had, this flawed scheme will serve Australian consumers very, very badly. This bill is a mix of the good and the bad. It has provisions which markedly improve the telecommunications wholesale pricesetting provisions, and they have my firm support based upon 15 years of experience in this sector. But those are what is required. To combine them with this grubby deal creating a monopoly broadband company and squandering $43 billion of taxpayers' money is a truly bad mistake. (Time expired)",132
206,Mr SYMON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I speak in support of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010. This bill will enhance competition in the Australian telecommunications industry and strengthen consumer safeguards. The Australian telecommunications market is characterised by a very strong and highly integrated incumbent, Telstra. That is no accident. That has happened over many years. Prior to it being Telmostra, it was Telecom. Prior to that, it was the PMG. It was a monopoly service. In many ways, a lot of that has stayed. If you have a look at a suburban street or a suburban office block or shop and see how the phone cable actually gets into the business or the home, there is only one way and there is only one cable. It will come down the street either on poles or underneath the footpath, maybe in a conduit, through a few pits, maybe from a local exchange; but it all comes back to one point, and that point is Telstra. Competition is hard when you cannot use the infrastructure. We have seen it over many years when phone companies have sprung up and tried to do things. Optus did do some things. They installed their HFC and they were able to do some local phone hook-ups. It is still not easy for competitors to break into that market. When we talk about competition in telecommunications, we really need to have a good look at the way that Australia has done it, because it has not worked. We have some of the most expensive communications in the world. There is no need for it to be so expensive. What we are talking about with this bill will start to change that so that we are up there with the world-and not only in terms of cost but also in terms of speed and availability of access. Telstra owns the only copper network, connecting almost every house; it owns the largest HFC cable and mobile networks; and it owns a 50 per cent stake in Foxtel, which is Australia's largest subscription television provider. The Australian telecommunications market is unique in its structure and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has a role of investigating the state of the market. In its recent reports into the telecommunication industry of 2007 and 2008, the ACCC noted: The competitive markets anticipated in 1997 do not appear to be emerging. The major downstream services continue to exhibit high levels of concentration, regulatory mechanisms are still heavily relied upon for promoting and maintaining competitive outcomes and the levels of consumer complaints about the industry reached new heights in 2007-08. The report continued, noting ‘the industry continues to have an extremely high level of disputation and litigation'. In 2007-08, the ACCC was notified of 28 new access disputes and had 18 of its arbitral determinations subject to judicial review by the Federal Court. The ACCC report continued: … the level of disputation and litigation in the telecommunications sector far outstrips that in any other regulated sector and is contributing to some frustration of competitive outcomes. Separate to the official reports, the Chairman of the ACCC, Graeme Samuel, has made his views on the separation of Telstra well known. In a recent statement he said: We have been debating this issue for years and years and years. The ACCC, the National Competition Council and many experts in the area have said the only way to infuse true competition into Australian telecommunications is to remove that vertically integrated structure existing with stra, and to structurally separate. It is obvious from the ACCC reports that Australia's telecommunications market is not functioning as well as it could. Telstra's level of horizontal integration across the different delivery platformsHFC, copper, cable and mobile-is in contrast to many countries, where there are restrictions on incumbents owning both cable and traditional fixed-line telephone networks. Telstra's horizontal integration has significantly contributed to Telstra's ongoing dominance in the Australian telecommunications market. Since 1997 Telstra has continued to hold a significant share of the telecommunications market and has been able to block new entrants and competitors from gaining traction in the market. And what has been the impact of this type of market here in Australia? As I mentioned before, it means higher prices for consumers. It means less choice. In many cases, it means lower speeds. Australia currently has the 5th most expensive broadband charges amongst OECD countries. It is estimated that Telstra enjoys profit margins of about 60 per cent on fixed line services-that is according to analysts at JP Morgan. And Australians face the world's highest prices for sending a text message. You would not think so with the amount of text messaging that goes on now. But competition in this area is still not what it should be. This bill is about breaking open the telecommunications market and enabling real competition to deliver lower prices and better services for all Australians. This bill will force Telstra to voluntarily separate its businesses by denying the company its ability to bid for valuable future spectrum if it does not undertake that separation. It is envisaged that Telstra will negotiate a transfer of its fixed line assets to the new National Broadband TelNetwork. On 20 June this year Telstra and the NBN Co. announced that they had entered into a financial heads of agreement to move its fixed-line asset to the new National Broadband Network. The agreement will deliver structural separation by providing for the progressive migration of customer services from Telstra's copper and pay TV cable networks to the new wholesale only network to be built and operated by the NBN Co. Such an approach will ultimately lead to a national outcome where there is a wholesale only network not controlled by any retail company. This is critical to fostering greater competition in the telecommunications market. Again, it is about choice. This company, NBN Co., will on-sell its capacity to all competitors in the market. This type of competition is currently not possible as the holder of the majority of the fixed line assets, Telstra, is a profit-making competitor to the companies to whom it is selling capacity. The way things are going at the moment is just not working. The government's key objective is to promote an open, competitive telecommunications market to provide Australian consumers with access to innovative and affordable services. This legislation will amend the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to clarify the role of the ACCC in determining the price that competitors will pay to access the NBN. Under the proposed changes to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, the ACCC will set price and nonprice terms of access for declared services in an access determination to apply to all parties. The bill will also remove the right to seek merits reviews of the ACCC's regulatory decisions. The removal of this right to review is due to an excessive amount of disputes and litigation, which has had the effect of delaying and suppressing competition in the telecommunications market. In addition to seeking the separation of Telstra's business and generating a changed market for telecommunications, this bill will enhance and strengthen Australia's consumer protection legislation. The bill strengthens existing legislative requirements to better protect consumers, address falling service quality and ensure continued access to basic voice services in the lead-up to the NBN. There are measures to improve the effectiveness of the regulating body, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, through enhanced regulatory powers. And this bill amends the Consumer Protection Act to include new requirements for the customer service guarantee. That covers the universal service provider and ensures that they supply on request standard telephone services with characteristics and to performance standards determined by the minister. It is intended that performance standards will include maximum periods of time for new connections and fault rectification and reliability standards. We, as members of this place, all hear stories about our constituents having to wait extended periods of time to have faults fixed, to get new services installed or, even worse, to request a broadband connection to a suburban house and find out that, for whatever reason, they are not allowed to have broadband even though their neighbours may well have it. The universal service obligation will include the provision of payphone services. There will also be public consultation and notification of proposals to remove payphones. That is another ongoing problem that many members of this place have spent a lot of time dealing with. Payphones are a simple issue and one that many people regard as a community asset anyway-even if it is at the local railway station. It is always in use but, in recent years, has always been under threat of removal because a profit motive is put behind it. Mr Ciobo interjecting",135
207,Mr SYMON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Those on the other side may actually not know how to use a payphone, but many of us on this side have spent years and years having to use such devices and having to catch the train to and from work. ACMA will have new powers to direct the universal service provider not to remove payphones. Under this bill, new requirements will be imposed on service providers to ensure that statutory performance benchmarks are met. If they are not, the service provider will be subject to civil penalties. These enhanced penalties and the broad powers that this bill grants ACMA to issue infringement notices or on-the-spot fines for breaches of the civil penalty provisions will help ACMA effectively enforce this consumer safeguard. This bill is about delivering for Australia an important reform in the telecommunications industry. Telecommunications, as we know, are central to an innovative and modern economy. Communications such as high speed broadband can generate economic growth and create jobs. The current market, as we know, is dominated by Telstra, which has consistently protected its market share at the expense of new entrants. This reform is supported by the Chairman of the ACCC and many informed experts. Reforming markets can make a substantial difference to quality and pricing. You only need to look at the changes in the airline industry with the dismantling of the previous oligopoly, the substantial drop in pricing and the rise in use of airline travel. The benefits that flowed to regional tourism as a result of that move are huge. The same can happen in telecommunications-especially for those on the other side who do not like to use payphones. This bill will enhance competitive outcomes in the Australian telecommunications industry and strengthen consumer safeguards. I commend the bill to the House. Debate interrupted. NA",137
208,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before I call the member for Moncrieff, I draw members' attention to the presence in the gallery of the Australian Golf Industry Council, in particular Stuart Appleby, the Australian Masters Champion, and Rachel Hetherington, one of Australia's leading female golf professionals. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA NA (COMPETITION AND CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed.",138
209,Mr CIOBO,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010. This is an interesting debate about how this nation addresses telecommunications issues. This has been an industry with perhaps the most rapid convergence and evolution of telecommunications, digital media, entertainment and various components that, in an increasing fashion, are coming together through a variety of mediums and through a variety of technologies. What we see in telecommunications is a difficulty from a policymaking perspective-and this applies both to coalition members and to members of the Labor Party in government-about the framework that we put in place to best deal with the issues and the policy responses required to do effectively two things. The first is to ensure that safeguards are in place-that there is a framework that enables a competitive environment across a range of currently separate but related industries. For example, pay television was once the domain of easily definable television operators and broadcasters but is now increasingly also the domain of mobile telephony and of fixed line broadcasting over, for example, pay TV. Increasingly, there is the ability to use the internetin particular, high-speed bandwidth-to access, on demand, the kinds of media that people would like to watch on their computer screens or through streaming on their television screens. Likewise, take radio: only a matter of a decade or so ago radio was discrete. It was something that could be pointed at, something transmitted wirelessly, by broadcasters. In our respective electorates across Australia, we had radio stations that we could listen to. But, increasingly, with the convergence of technology and the convergence of media, we see that radio can now be accessed both wirelessly-in the traditional sense of the word ‘wireless'-and over the internet. It is possible with a few simple clicks to start tening to a radio station effectively anywhere around the world. This is an exciting period of time. Part of what this bill is directed towards is the pling with a policy challenge that all parliamentarians face about the way in which we establish the framework that enables the ongoing convergence, development and deployment of new technology-the ongoing investment in research and technology and the ongoing commercial imperative that will drive what is required from the marketplace as we trial and error new technologies, new broadcasters, new approaches and new policy frameworks. By the same token, we also need to be mindful that there are at stake some legacy issues. That is the second limb that I referred to earlier. We know that Telstra-Telecom, as it was-was the monopoly supplier of telecommunications in this country. We know that Telstra was the behemoth of the Australian government that over the years has been increasingly subjected to a competitive tempo and to different competitors entering the marketplace. With the convergence of technology, there is no doubt that Telstra's competitors are now many more in number and also, in the delivery mechanism, quite profoundly different to what they were, for example, only 10 years ago. Part of the bill that is before the House today is the government's attempted policy response to dealing with this convergence issue and to a rapidly evolving marketplace. The coalition has some concerns about this bill. Although we are supportive, subject to the amendments that we have moved, the coalition's concerns come down to several key factors, which in essence can be summarised by the fact that for all intents and purposes it would appear the government is holding a gun at the head of Telstra-and, in lisparticular, through Telstra Telstra's shareholders-with the bill that is currently before the House. The coalition has in the past opposed this bill. We now look at supporting grapthe bill, subject to the amendments that I mentioned, because we recognise that the government has made changes which have improved the bill and has incorporated some of the concerns that the coalition has raised. But we still have amendments that, frankly, the government should look at adopting if it does not want to be political about this matter. I have the privilege of representing around 100,000 people, many of whom are retirees, both self-funded and pensioners. A large number of these retirees, and people more broadly across my community in Moncrieff, are Telstra shareholders. They may have purchased Telstra shares in the first, second or third tranche of the sale of Telstra and they are looking for a return on the capital that they have invested in that company. Many of them have contacted me, concerned about this government's plans to erode the market value of the asset that they used their hardearned money to purchase when Telstra was privatised. That is the reason that, in some respects, the coalition sought to force the government to make changes, because we did not like their approach. We know that intimidation is a stock dard operating process for many of the trade union movements in this country. We know that there are even elements of that intimidation that flow in the Australian Labor Party today. But, frankly, we should not accept the same kind of intimidation when it comes to one of Australia's corporate players and to this government's approach in dealing with what is a very important company, and one of the most widely held companies, in Australia today. That is why the coalition resolutely and steadfastly adopted the view that we would not kowtow to this government's attempts to intimidate Telstra with respect to its structural separation. I believe as a matter of economic policy that there are benefits to structural separation; I have always held that view. But the question, as always, is how, once the egg is scrambled, you then go back to making changes. When it comes to the wholesale retail network of Telstra, and when it comes to a rapidly evolving marketplace with myriad technologies and, importantly, myriad delivery mechanisms, it is crucial that the mechanism and the policy approach that government adopts are the correct ones. There are a number of aspects to this bill that I believe do not achieve the outcomes that are sought. Streamlining access and anticompetitive provisions in the Competition and Consumer Act to promote competition in the telecommunications industry is a noble goal, one I am supportive of, but the amendments that we seek to make will improve the bill. It is up to the Labor government to recognise that we are not overreaching with the changes that we are asking for. We are not overreaching in any way, shape or form and, in fact, the amendments that the coalition is moving in this particular piece legislation will help to enhance the competitive framework that will apply to Telstra in stan- the retail separation from the wholesale which is sought. While the Labor government insists that the Telstra and NBN Co. arrangement is subject to review by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, a central component of this piece of legislation, the coalition remains concerned that the bill, and in particular section 577BA, explicitly excludes the deal that the government is attempting to achieve from the usual scrutiny of the Competition and Consumer Act. What is more, the bill allows for ministerial interference in the ACCC's handling of the deal, which in my view further undermines the integrity of the process. The government claims that this bill will provide Telstra with access to the wireless spectrum required for the next generation of wireless systems but does so only if the separation of Telstra is done to the absolute satisfaction of government. This goes to the very matter that I raised at the outset of my speech-that is, that it is, effectively, akin to the government holding a gun to the head of Telstra and, I believe more importantly, to the shareholders and owners of Telstra, many of whom live on the Gold Coast in my electorate of Moncrieff. We have proposed four amendments which we believe, effectively, guarantee the integrity of the separation process by reducing opportunities for government interference in the decision-making processes of the ACCC. Subject to approval by Telstra shareholders, the proposed separation should be delivered in a manner that is cost effective, promotes competition and imposes no greater cost on taxpayers than is absolutely necessary. That is a relatively straightforward proposal which is worthy of support in this chamber. Telstra, like other regulated utilities of such as gas, electricity and water, should of course be left free to charge prices that deliver a reasonable rate of return on its assets. This can be achieved through the amendments that have been put forward, which will place taxpayer interests ahead of those of Telstra, NBN Co. and the government. We know that this government is obsessed with the need to roll out its NBN Co. It is a linchpin for this government, whose members wander round Australia trumpeting NBN Co. as the great new, almost Soviet-era style project of this government, promising rapid broadband to everyone, with no mention of the asterisks and all the associated costs and no mention of the debt that this government has racked up as part of its grand vision for broadband in this country. That is why we say, through the amendments that we have put forward: let us put the interests of taxpayers first and foremost. The amendments will explicitly ensure that the Competition and Consumer Act applies to the NBN Co. and Telstra deal. The amendments will allow parliament to disallow ministerial directions to the ACCC regarding the NBN Co. and Telstra deal. The amendments will remove the threat of cable television sell-off or limited access to wireless spectrum should Telstra not separate in a way that the government approves, which goes back to the issue about there being a gun at the head of Telstra management and, importantly, Telstra shareholders. And the amendments will restore merit reviews and procedural fairness to the ACCC's enforcement of the new access pricing regime. These amendments ought to be supported by the government. They are amendments that place taxpayers' interests at No. 1 on the list. They are amendments that protect the capital that has been invested by those million-plus shareholders across Australia and, importantly, they dilute this government's complete absorption when it comes to the political pursuit of its NBN Co. at basically any cost. It should be watered down. It should be diluted. And it should be replaced by a primary interest that is more concerned with taxpayers' outcomes and shareholders' outcomes over and above the political outcomes sought by government. I certainly urge the House to support the amendments to this bill that the coalition will put forward.",138
210,Mr STEPHEN JONES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The primary aims of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010 are, firstly, to tackle long-overdue industry reform by providing a legislative framework for Telstra to voluntarily structurally separate by migrating its customers to the National Broadband Network, as agreed in the financial heads of agreement between Telstra and NBN Co.; secondly, to strengthen the telecommunications-specific access regime to provide more certain and quicker outcomes for telecommunications companies; thirdly, to streamline the anticompetitive conduct regime by removing procedural impediments that in the past have restricted the effective operation of the telecommunications-specific competition regime in this country; and, finally, to significantly strengthen consumer safeguards. The bill deals with the issue of structural separation by setting out a legislative framework for Telstra to voluntarily structurally separate by migrating its customers to the NBN. The bill will finally deliver what is long overdue for Australia's telecommunications industry-that is, competition. That is because the fundamental structural impediments to competition that have existed in this country since the transition of Telstra from a fully government owned telecommunications company to a fully privatised company are dealt with once and for all in this bill. The bill recognises that, despite nearly two decades of deregulation in the telecommunications industry, which has delivered some benefits in the rollout of infrastructure, mainly in mobile and radio based technology, competition in infrastructure has not occurred in the fixed line network. The market, quite simply, has failed to deliver real competition in the provision of this infrastructure. There is a very simple reason for this: it is massively expensive and the returns on investment are very low outside the major capital cities and the significant trunk routes down the east coast of Australia. There is no doubt that Telstra has rolled out broadband services in the past decade in a highly selective manner, focusing primarily on the profitable urban markets and neglecting the rest of Australia. Who could blame it? There was very little incentive to do otherwise. Telstra continued to cut back its capiing tal investment in the fixed line network and, as a result, investment in the Telstra Customer Access Network stagnated. The result was that Telstra's degraded network was wholly unsuited to the provision of anything but the most basic broadband services. The near-monopoly of Telstra in the fixed line market meant that the company had no incentive to invest in upgrading its network to provide services until it was forced to do so. This meant that Australians were held back from access to decent broadband services for too long. The structural separation measures in this bill are understandably welcomed by Telstra's competitors-and indeed by Telstra itself since the financial heads of agreement between Telstra and the Australian government were signed in June this year. And the really big winners from this legislation will be the Australian consumers, who will finally be on their way to getting cheaper and faster broadband services. The NBN will be Australia's first truly tional wholesale-only network. No retail company will be able to control the network in its own interests. This is important for consumers and the prices they will pay because the discipline of genuine competition and competitive pressures in the market drive lower prices, innovation and greater choice of different services and price points. The lack of competition has held Australia back from moving into a broadband future. It is no wonder that the structural separation of Telstra has been described as a ‘landmark change' by Australia's second and third largest telcos, Optus and iiNet. Until the advent of the Gillard government's policy to create a National Broadband Network, competition in the fixed line network was, in effect, stymied. It was frustrating for government, frustrating for Telstra's competitors and frustratfor consumers. It was even frustrating for Telstra as the company struggled under the heavy hand of government regulation that vainly attempted to provide competition in the fixed line retail telephone services in the face of these structural issues. And it was not their fault that they did not succeed in this regard. They were battling real structural issues. It is disappointing that the member for Wentworth is still clinging to the idea that these structural issues can be dealt with through a functional separation of Telstra, with both the wholesale and retail networks still owned by the one company, Telstra. Let me assure him-as he enters the chamberand members opposite that this approach has been tried and has failed. He needs just to ask former ministers for communications Senator Alston and Senator Coonan. It was clear to all that the coalition government was hopelessly compromised as it tried to both maximise the sale price as part of Telstra's privatisation and at the same time deal with na- the difficult competition issues raised by such a large incumbent company that was both vertically and horizontally integrated. So instead of clinging to the failed policy positions of the past decade, the shadow minister would be better to get on board with the NBN and to stop throwing up spurious diversions to detract from the progression of this important project. This legislative framework will provide some measure of certainty for Telstra going forward into the NBN era. That is good news for all. Given all of this, you would think that those opposite would welcome the government's plan for a national broadband network and the opportunity for Australians to move forward into a digital economy without any impediments such as those that I have just described. I turn now to the regulatory reforms in the bill. The government has considered the important regulatory measures that will be necessary during the transition to the NBN to ensure that the consumer service regime is maintained. The government has rightly taken this opportunity to examine the current regulatory framework as a result of representations, mainly from Telstra's competitors, that the current regime is inadequate. Changes to part XIC of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 mean that the ACCC will have an enhanced and streamlined role, allowing it to set price and non-price terms for access to declared services in access determinations to apply to all parties. This put Telstra and its competitors on a level playing field for the first time. There is no doubt that this regulatory review was much needed. The extremely high number of telecommunications access disputes that have been notified since the commencement of the regime in 1997 point to a failing system. Telstra's highly litigious approach might have been good for its lawyers, but it was not good for other telecommunications companies struggling to compete in such an uncertain and frustrating regulatory environment. Another important measure in this regard is that this bill will remove the right to seek merits review of ACCC regulatory decisions. This approach is being pursued because Telstra has continually used every regulatory and legal avenue available to frustrate regulatory outcomes and cause uncertainty for its competitors. By providing the ACCC with the power to issue binding rules of conduct, the ACCC will be able to take action immediately to address problems relating to the supply of declared services. The telecommunications industry will at last have a greater degree of certainty in relation to regulatory outcomes and this certainty will encourage investment. I turn now to the consumer protection measures contained within the bill. The big winners from this bill will be consumers. That is because the measures in this bill are focused on retaining and strengthening existing regulation to better protect consumers' access to, and the reliability of, basic telephone services and to address concerns with the removal of payphones. The measures in this bill reflect the government's decision to retain the existing universal service obligation on Telstra for voice telephony and payphones in the lead-up to the NBN and the new universal service obligation company, and to require improvewill ments to service quality by introducing new minimum performance benchmarks in meeting the customer service guarantee. The new universal service arrangements will make explicit, for consumers and for Telstra, the services-both voice telephony and payphone-Telstra must supply in fulfilment of the universal service obligation. This provision is incredibly important for consumers in regional Australia, including those in my electorate of Throsby where we still rely on the important services provided by payphones. It is incredibly important to ensure that people of low socio-economic background have access to those payphone services. So Telstra must supply the services, which include reliability standards and repair requirements, specified in the new universal service arrangements to fulfil its universal service obligation-this is instead of leaving these decisions to the sole discretion of Telstra. This measure will address the concerns raised in the report of the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee-that the universal service obligation arrangements are both vague and difficult to enforce. In conclusion, the measures in this bill are a landmark for the Australian telecommunications industry. After nearly 20 years of reform to this sector, this Gillard Labor government is finally getting the measures right to ensure that we have genuine competition within the industry, not only in mobile telecommunications services-critical services for households and for industry-but in fixed-line services and in fast, reliable, fordable, high-speed broadband services. The bill also provides enhanced consumer protections. Given this, it is hard to comprehend why the opposition cannot bring themselves to support it. They are out of touch with their own electorates-this is particularly so for those members opposite who represent regional electorates-and with the national interest on this. I commend the bill to the House.",141
211,Mr ALBANESE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (6.51 pm)in reply-I thank members for their significant contributions to the debate on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010, which is so important to Australia's current and future economic prosperity. Measures put forward in this bill were originally debated in the previous parliament. fair to say that they have been the subject of considerable discussion over the past year. The government has taken note of the many constructive comments provided and changes have been made to the legislation to address those of them that were worthy of support. The NBN is a historic nation-building investment which will help transform the Australian economy and create the new businesses and jobs of the 21st century. This is a view shared by the OECD. The OECD concludes in its recently released economic survey of Australia that the NBN has the potential to yield substantial benefits, especially in terms of productivity, and that it will improve internet services for the entire Australian population. It also concludes that it will promote fairer competition between private firms on retail services. Through the NBN the Gillard government is ensuring that every Australian, no matter where they live, has access to affordable af- high-speed broadband. The NBN will be a wholesale-only, open access network. It will introduce competition to the telecommunications market, and this will open up genuine choice of services and drive highly competitive prices for consumers, whether they live in a capital city or in rural and regional areas. This acknowledges that Australia has fallen further and further behind the rest of the world since the Liberals and their National coalition colleagues voted to privatise Telstra without any review and without ever putting in place the arrangements to properly protect competition and services in regional areas. It also acknowledges that current infrastructure based competition in Australia has failed. This is in light of the most recent OECD statistics which show that Australia is now ranked 17th out of 31 countries for fixedbroadband subscribers. Australians also pay It is more for broadband than most OECD countries. For average subscription prices, AustraNBN lia is the fifth most expensive overall. People across the country are crying out for faster, more affordable broadband and the Gillard Labor government is getting on with the process of delivering it. The rollout in Tasmania is progressing on time and under budget. On the mainland, in four of the first release sites NBN Co. has received requests to connect on average about 75 per cent of premises with a fibre connection. The government does not require a cost-benefit analysis to know that this is a piece of structure that Australia needs. To do a formal cost-benefit analysis of the NBN would take many years, require many heroic assumptions and would tell us something we already know-that Australia needs greater investment in high-speed broadband infrastructure. The implementation study confirms the NBN can be built on a financially viable basis with affordable prices for consumers. The government released this study in full on 6 May 2010. After eight months of detailed analysis, the implementation study confirmed that under a range of realistic scenarios NBN Co. will have a strong and viable business case. It also confirmed that the project can be expected to generate a return of six to seven per cent, and that the government could expect to generate a return on its investment to cover its cost of funds. That said, during the rollout the existing telecommunications regulatory regime will remain important for delivering services in the interests of Australian consumers and businesses. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010 is designed to reshape that regime. The measures proposed will streamline the regulatory framework to enhance competition and better protect consumers. Structural reform of the industry will be implemented with the transition to the in line with the government's vision for a wholesale-only, open access network. Incentives will be created for Telstra and other telecommunications operators to transform the way they do business and to become more innovative and customer focused. These changes to the telecommunications access regime will underpin greater investment by giving all parties regulatory certainty. The bill will also safeguard consumers by strengthening the current universal service obligation, customer service guarantee infraand priority assistance arrangements. On 20 June 2010 Telstra and NBN Co. announced that they had entered into a financial heads of agreement. That agreement provides for the progressive migration of customers from Telstra's copper and pay TV cable networks to NBN Co's new wholesaleonly, fibre network as it is rolled out. This will deliver the ultimate structural reform of the telecommunications sector. This legislation will create a framework to deliver this important reform. The coalition are putting forward a number of amendments to the legislation. It follows, of course, the 20 different broadband plans that they have had. First, they want to remove the provisions designed to exempt any agreement between Telstra and NBN Co. from the provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act on the grounds that they might allow anticompetitive outcomes. First and foremost, the opposition fail to acknowledge that the structural reform to be delivered is in the national interest. However, the ACCC will consider the competitive impacts of any agreement between Telstra and NBN Co. as part of its scrutiny of Telstra's structural separation undertaking, or SSU. Any agreement will need to be reviewed in the context of considering the SSU that Telstra lodges with the ACCC in order for the SSU to be approved and the arrangements authorised. Once approval is given the agreement and associated conduct will be authorised for the purposes of trade practices law. This removes any need for separate authorisation inquiry, while still ensuring appropriate scrutiny of the arrangements. The bill relies on the authorisation provisions in section 51 of the Competition and Consumer Act. This is a well-established mechanism which has been used extensively by Australian governments. The ACCC website currently lists 80 separate pieces of Commonwealth, state and territory legislation where section 51 authorisations are in use. Secondly, the opposition proposes that certain ministerial instruments be subject to disallowance by parliament. The government's strong view is that these instruments should not be disallowable as the risk of disallowance would cause uncertainty for Telstra. The bill requires that certain instruments must be in place to permit Telstra to lodge its SSU with the ACCC. Disallowance would threaten this outcome and could have the perverse effect of forcing Telstra to undertake functional separation even when its preferred option is structural separation. Thirdly, the opposition calls for the removal of the so-called guns to Telstra's head by denying it wireless spectrum and forcing it to divest its interests in Foxtel unless it voluntarily agrees to separate. These so called provisions have been removed. There is no longer an automatic prohibition on the acquisition of spectrum if Telstra does not structurally separate and divest its interests in its cable network and Foxtel. The bill has been amended to give Telstra sufficient regulatory certainty to take a firm proposal to its shareholders to structurally separate by allowing Telstra to acquire specified bands of spectrum, unless the minister determines otherwise in a legislative instrument. The bill does not require Telstra to divest its interests in Foxtel but still provides a framework for Telstra to voluntarily divest its interests in Foxtel and its hybrid fibre-coaxial cable network. In the event that Telstra does not proceed with structural separation, the minister could take into account Telstra's ownership of Foxtel and its cable network in determining whether to use the powers in the bill to prevent Telstra from acquiring certain spectrum to address Telstra's power in telecommunications markets. Fourthly, the opposition want to subject ACCC decisions to merits review. This is despite the fact that in 2002, when they were in government, they repealed merits review for ACCC arbitration determinations because it was hindering the development of competition. It is the government's view that the notional accountability benefits of merits review within the current system are strongly outweighed by the delays, the regulatory uncertainty and the outright gaming that have occurred. Furthermore, it is an inappropriate provision. Under paragraph 4.53 of the Administrative Review Council guidelines about what kinds of administrative decisions are suitable for merits review, decisions which involve extensive public inquiries or consultations are not suitable for merits review. ACCC access determinations which involve extensive public consultation fall into this category. Omitting merits review from the proposed arrangements reflects a majority of industry submissions on how best to improve the telecommunications access regime, and this aspect was almost universally welcomed by non-Telstra industry participants when the original bill was introduced last year. If the ACCC makes an error of law or process when it makes an access determination, any party affected by the decision will be able to apply to the Federal Court for judicial review of the decision just as they can now. Finally, the opposition want to restore the requirement for procedural fairness. The requirement for the ACCC to accord procedural fairness will apply to all of the ACCC's regulatory decisions under part XIC, except in relation to interim access determinations and binding rules of conduct. The salient point of introducing binding rules of conduct is to allow swift regulatory responses to urgent matters that may arise. According procedural fairness would inevitably delay such actions-hardly a desirable outcome in matters where speed is of the essence. In reality, procedural fairness will not be absent for long in this circumstance. Within 30 days after making binding rules of conduct, the ACCC will have to commence a public inquiry to vary the access determination or make a new access determination. Parties will be accorded procedural fairness in the public inquiry process. The opposition amendments are unnecessary and would serve only to complicate the proposed streamlining of the regulatory framework. In conclusion, I once again thank members for their contributions to the debate on this bill. These wide-ranging reforms address problems across the whole Australian telecommunications sector and represent the most significant reforms to the telecommunications legislative framework since 1997. The task of undertaking such difficult but necessary reform in an industry that is fundamental to Australia's long-term national interests is one which this government embraces wholeheartedly and one which the government encourages the parliament to embrace. The series of amendments put up by the opposition are once again an attempt by them to delay reform; it is to delay what is required to build a truly national broadband network that is suitable for the 21st century. We know that the National Broadband Network is absolutely vital to Australia's economic future but also in providing social equity due to the revolution that can occur through access to telecommunications. The NBN is indeed a historic nation-building investment. I commend this bill to the House and urge the parliament to reject the amendments that have been put forward.",144
212,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The question is that this bill be now read a second time. There being more than one voice calling for a division, in accordance with standing order 133(b) the division is deferred until 8 pm. Debate adjourned. NA BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 29 September, on motion by Mr Crean: That this bill be now read a second time.",147
213,Mr KEENAN,TERRITORIES LAW REFORM,"I rise to talk on the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010. This bill in the main relates to Norfolk Island, which is a unique and integral part of Australia. In addition to being one of Australia's most geographically isolated communities-indeed, probably one of the world's most isolated communities-it is also one of Australia's oldest territories, having been settled in conjunction with Australia's founding settlement at Sydney in New South Wales. The island has a unique history which is separate from Australia, although obviously clearly linked to Australia. At various times in its history, the island formed part of the colonies of Van Diemen's Land, now Tasmania, and New South Wales. Norfolk Island's convict history and the heritage and traditions of its residents, particularly those of Pitcairn descent, remain an important part of Australia's natural heritage and culture. Mr Christian-Bailey, a former member of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly, described the island culture in an article published in 2006, when he said: The Norfolk Island Community has an incredibly proud history. We were arguably the first people in the Commonwealth to have a free and compulsory vote for everyone over 18, including women. This was enshrined in our own laws as early as 1838. We have always been proud of our self reliance, our resourcefulness and of our strong community spirit. We have our own language, which we still love to use with one another, and our cultural traditions are strong and distinct those of Australia. I think that is an important point. The people of Norfolk Island see themselves obviously as Australians but as people with a separate culture from Australia and it is one that we should do our best to respect. Going back further to 1879, Joseph Campbell wrote an account about Norfolk Island and its inhabitants. Campbell describes the small and exceptionally beautiful place inhabited by some 400 people-about 250 who reside in the town, the rest in small farms in various parts of the island. There were excellent roads built by convicts, firstrate soils, thousands of lemon and guava trees, native flowers and the Norfolk Island pines. In those days a chief magistrate and jury ran the island. Islanders had no taxes to pay but gave one week's labour out of every seven months to any public work that needed to be done. Before a person could settle on Norfolk they needed to obtain the votes of two-thirds of everybody over 20 who could read and write. The inhabitants were described as very jealous of admitting people as members of their community. Times have changed somewhat and now you need a six-month residency before you can apply to stay on Norfolk Island permanently, although the island comes under the Australian Citizenship Act more broadly. Visitors to Norfolk and the islanders themselves often describe the island as one of the most beautiful and unspoilt places on earth. Sadly, I have not had the opportunity to travel to Norfolk Island in my capacity as the shadow minister responsible for external territories, although I have had discussions with many members of the coalition and outside of the coalition who have been to the island. They have reinforced to me that the island has its own culture, traditions and values. I am keen to go and see this for myself from at some stage in the future. But I have had a chance to meet with the Norfolk Islander legislators when they have been in Canberra and I have consulted with them over the telephone. I acknowledge the efforts that they have made in contacting me to let me know their thoughts about this bill which, of course, will radically change the way Norfolk Island is governed. Successive Australian governments have acknowledged the importance of Norfolk Island to Australia's national heritage and the value of the traditions and culture of the Pitcairn descendants as part of a wider multicultural Australia. However, while the Norfolk Island community is unique in many ways, many of the issues that confront the people on Norfolk Island are similar to those that occur in regional towns of a similar size. Norfolk is relatively small, being inhabited by some 1,500 residents. The community is physically removed from the centre of power in Australia, geographically and also emotionally. The people of Norfolk are very far removed from Canberra. I feel some sympathy toward the people in relation to this. However, I understand that there are many on Norfolk Island who also yearn to have the same privileges and rights that all other Australians have. As the former Western Australian senator, the Hon. Ian Campbell, said when he was Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads in 2004: … it is very important that people in a place like Norfolk Island who do not necessarily agree with that sort of received wisdom feel that they have got the right to pursue a different way of doing things. In considering the need for electoral reform, it is important to bear in mind that the Australian parliament has the overarching responsibility to protect the rights of its citisame zens wherever they may live in the Federation-and, of course, that includes in our external territories. Indeed, this parliament has an obligation to ensure that all laws in Australian jurisdictions are consistent with the national obligations under international law. As has been previously noted about Norfolk Island, the constitutional status of the island is complex and unusual. After the creation of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, Norfolk Island was placed under the authority of the new Commonwealth government to be administered as an external territory. During World War II the island became a key air base in refuelling depots between Australia and New Zealand and between New Zealand and the Solomon Islands. Since Norfolk Island fell within New Zealand's area of responsibility, it was soned by a New Zealand army unit known as N Force at a large army camp that had the capacity to house 1,500 people. N Force relieved a company of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force which allowed them to go and campaign elsewhere. But the island proved to be too remote to come under attack during the war and N Force, the New Zealand garrison, left the island in February 1944. In 1979 Norfolk Island was granted limited self-government by Australia under what they consider to be a proxy constitution where the island elects a government that runs most of the island's affairs. As such, residents of Norfolk Island are not represented in the Commonwealth parliament, making them the only group of residents in an Australian state or territory not represented here. This bill makes radical changes to what had been put in place in 1979. The Territories Law Reform Bill 2010 will change radically the governance, electoral and financial administration of Norfolk Island. The changes are substantial and the way the island is governed will not be the again if this bill is passed in its present form. The bill in schedules 2 and 3 also revises a vesting section of the Christmas Island Act 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955. The bill makes significant changes to the governance, electoral and financial mechanisms for Norfolk Island. More specifically, these changes would allow the Governor General and the responsible Commonwealth minister to take a more active role in the introduction and passage of Norfolk Island legislation, including provision for the Commonwealth minister to give directions in schedule 2 matters and to reserve schedule 2 matters for the Governor General's consideration. It also provides for the selection and prescribes the roles of the Chief Minister and other ministers, including garriby limiting the number of ministers that might be appointed, by allowing the removal of the Chief Minister by the Administrator in exceptional circumstances and by limiting the power to allocate ministerial portfolios to the Chief Minister. The bill allows regulations to be made for a code of conduct for members of the Norfolk Island Public Service. Clearly, with a population of 1,500, the Norfolk Island Public Service is not an extensive organisation, and I will get to that a little later on. This bill also provides that regulations can be made for changes to the process for the election of the Legislative Assembly, provides for minimum and maximum fixed terms of the Legislative Assembly, and implements a contemporary financial management framework, including provision for contemporary guidelines for financial reporting, budgeting and auditing of the administration's financial statements by the Commonwealth Auditor General. It also allows for the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to operate on Norfolk Island and provide for merits review of decisions made by the Norfolk Island administration. Finally, it applies the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1988 to information held by the Norfolk Island government and its administration. Schedules 2 and 3 amend the Christmas Island Act 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955. These amendments provide a vesting mechanism for powers and functions under Western Australian laws applied to those territories-powers and functions under Western Australian officers and authorities where an agreement with the Australian government exists for those officers and authorities to act in the territories. Although the coalition supports this bill in principle, we do have some reservations, and of course the Norfolk Island government has previously expressed significant reservations about this bill. We in the opposition are specifically concerned about the increased bureaucratic processes that this bill entails, we believe they will place in some circumstances an undue burden on Norfolk Island's limited public service. I will detail these amendments shortly. I want to go to the concerns that the Norfolk Island government have in the past expressed in relation to this bill. I do acknowledge-and I am sure the government will point this out when the minister makes his contribution-that the Norfolk Island government's position has changed significantly since this bill was introduced. They did come and see us in Canberra and they expressed significant concerns about the bill taking away what they believed was their right to self-government. That situation has changed, but it has changed in conjunction with the fact that Norfolk Island has some significant financial difficulties and as a result the Commonwealth has them somewhat-to use the phrase-over a barrel, and they do now support the bill. This has been reiterated to me by the Norfolk Island government. They do now support this bill in its current form. Notwithstanding that, the opposition still believe that it makes very little sense for us to inflict the full horror of Australian bureaucracy on an island of 1,500 people and we will seek to move what we believe are sensible amendments to at least allow the Norfolk Island administration to attempt to do some of the things in a way that might be more appropriate for an island of their size; specifically we would like to do that in relation to privacy provisions and the freedom of information regime. Before going specifically to that I do want to acknowledge that, regardless of the fact that the Norfolk Island government have now changed their position, they did have some concerns with this bill in the past. Those concerns have been expressed very stridently to the joint standing committee and which had a look into this legislation. Their concerns can be detailed in six different parts. The concerns were legitimate. We in the opposition did not support them all but it is important as a parliament that we acknowledge and give due respect to the Norfolk Island government by detailing the concerns that they have expressed in the past about this legislation. Firstly, they believed that the legislation was going to lead to the erosion of their ability to self-govern. That is a right that they guard very jealously. The Norfolk Island government argued that their ability to manage schedule 2 matters was a fundamental part of their ability to self-govern. According to the Norfolk Island government, schedule 2 matters affect the internal machinery of their own government. Matters under schedule 2 include but are not limited to roads, street lighting, electricity supply, quarrying, tourism, firearms, housing, community and cultural affairs as well as matters incidental to or consequent on the examination of executive authority. In a previous letter the Chief Minister of Norfolk Island, Mr Buffett, noted that the addition of a veto power for matters pertaining to schedule 2 undermines the very principle that underlies the democratic rights of Norfolk Islander voters to govern themselves in relation to matters that are specific to Norfolk Island. The second concern that the Norfolk Island government had expressed was the ability for the Commonwealth to remove the Legislative Assembly. The Norfolk Island government argued that, to provide fair and equitable government, the ability to dissolve the assembly should only be available to the Governor General, who would be able to, on advice from the administrator, appoint a caretaker government, as is the convention here in Australia. The third issue they had raised as a concern was the issue of elections. The Norfolk Island government had previously agreed with the recommendation of the joint standing committee that this part of the bill be removed and further discussion and consultation be entered into. The fourth concern of the Norfolk Island administration in relation to this bill was that they largely did not agree with the financial proposals that are contained within it. They have expressed the view that these proposals would result in direct interference with the operation of the Norfolk Island government and they were particularly concerned with the obligations on employees of the Norfolk Island government to provide information not necessarily agreed to or vetted by the Norfolk Island government. They have expressed this in the past and they believed that this allowed the Commonwealth government to bypass the elected representatives of Norfolk Island and treats employees of the Norfolk Island government as if they were employees of the Commonwealth government. The fifth issue that was raised relates to accountability processes. The island government had reservations about the method of implementation proposed by the bill for the Administrative Appeals Tribunals for privacy conditions and for the freedom of information provisions. As I mentioned previously, the coalition also believes that transposing the full bureaucratic Australian model, designed to cover our 22 million people, onto the people of Norfolk Island, which has a population of 1,500 people, really is taking the desire to standardise our laws to a ludicrous extreme. The Norfolk Island government had expressed their desire to implement a different model-and this is what the opposition continues to support-in relation to how they dealt with the Commonwealth Ombudsman being allowed to have an involvement in Norfolk Island matters, and that is that they would work with the Commonwealth on providing a model that was more appropriate for Norfolk Island-and in the past they had hoped that the Commonwealth would do that. I had some discussions with the Australian government prior to the election. The Labor government did not seem to have any particular objections to this and, indeed, I did hope that we might be able to work with them on making these amendments. Clearly since the election they have changed their view and now they do not want to enter into those discussions and they insist that this bill be passed in its wholesale form, which I think is a shame because we might have been able to come to a different arrangement and so make these amendments redundant. But the government are not interested in doing that. Finally, the sixth area of concern to the Norfolk Island government relates to the treatment of Norfolk Island deputies. The Norfolk Island government had concerns over the ability under the proposed bill for the responsible minister to appoint numerous deputies to the Administrator, and the Chief Minister had expressed the view directly that it had been identified that these deputies would be utilised in times of emergency, when the Administrator and the Official Secretary, who normally holds a dormant deputy commission, were not available. If this in fact was the case, the Norfolk Island government wanted this to be reflected in the bill ting it. to provide clarification of the deputies' role. Whilst acknowledging Norfolk Island's traditions and culture as well as the concern felt by some islanders that these reforms did threaten the current government situation on Norfolk Island, both the Norfolk Island government and the islanders recognise, at least in principle, the need for reform. Of course now they support this bill in a different way, but that really relates specifically to the changed financial circumstances on the island whereby they are requiring Commonwealth assistance and, of course, the Commonwealth has said, ‘We're happy to assist but only if this bill is supported' and so is now the position of the Norfolk Island government. But I do not think that we should have ever doubted that they had good intentions as to reforming the way that they govern Norfolk Island and that they were keen to work with the Commonwealth to find arrangements that they believed might have been more suitable for the way that Norfolk Island is governed. We still believe that there is a chance for this parliament to ease some of the bureaucratic weight that this legislation entails and we will be moving amendments, as I foreshadowed, to the way that freedom of information applies to Norfolk Island and the way that the Norfolk Island public sector agencies will be required to adhere to information privacy principles. We will be doing this because freedom of information as it relates to the Commonwealth of Australia and privacy as it relates to the Commonwealth of Australia involves incredibly extensive legislation. It would place very significant burdens on the very limited administration of Norfolk Island and we do not believe that there is necessarily a case for such a small administration to be exposed to the full weight of this enormous bureaucratic undertaking, which I think would be the best way of putThis bill does not need to extend the full gamut of Commonwealth FOI and privacy laws to Norfolk Island. No rationale has been supplied to this parliament as to why we should do that. There are the concerns of the Norfolk Island administration who, after all, are probably best placed to say what they believe is in Norfolk Island's interests and they should not be brushed aside or ignored. We believe that the concerns that they have had in the past in relation to the ability of the island's administration to be able to deal with such an enormous bureaucratic undertaking still stand and the opposition is going to that move amendments that will allow the islanders to maintain flexibility in determining what they believe is an appropriate level of added bureaucracy for their island. The amendments would allow the Norfolk Island government to legislate their own freedom of information and privacy principles and would give them the freedom of scope to decide what model best suits their needs. This is the approach that the Norfolk Island government have taken in their dealings with the Commonwealth in the past and it has been successful. Surely that is a better way rather than having the Commonwealth coming in and overriding the wishes of the Norfolk Island government, who were elected by the people of Norfolk Island to speak on their behalf. Surely it is better for the Commonwealth to sit down and try to work out a regime that best suits the island's needs rather than for the Commonwealth to come out with this ‘one size fits all' approach that says, ‘We're going to override the wishes of the local community and we're going to impose this enormous bureaucracy on Norfolk Island regardless of the wishes of its local community.' We would prefer to see a much more pragmatic approach from this parliament. We believe that approach would be in the best interests of Norfolk Islanders themselves. So we do support the thrust of this bill, as has the government of Norfolk Island, but we do not believe that we should necessarily be imposing the full gamut of freedom of information legislation and privacy legislation. So we would urge this parliament to explore a way with the government of Norfolk Island by which we can find mechanisms that are more suitable for a territory of their size and population with obviously a limited administrative capacity for an administration that governs only 1,500 people. We think that is a sensible approach and I would commend that to the House.",147
214,Ms BRODTMANN,TERRITORIES LAW REFORM,"It has been most interesting listening to the member for Stirling on this issue and is a great pleasure to speak today in support of the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010. It is also a great pleasure to speak about reform to the most remote part of my electorate, which is Norfolk Island. While this bill also addresses the way Western Australian laws apply to the Indian Ocean Territories, its main feature is Norfolk Island. As I said in my first speech, most people are aware of Norfolk Island's rich history and language. They are also aware that Colleen MCCullough lives there, that interesting pine trees grow there, that you need a passport to get therewhich is quite amusing and I think Kate Lundy and I are probably the only people who actually need a passport to go to part of our electorate-and that it is also a great place for a holiday. For most Australians, their knowledge of Norfolk Island would pretty much begin and end there. So they would not be aware that the island is in need of reform, and that is what this bill does. And they would not be aware that, even though Norfolk Island is part of the Commonwealth, part of Australia, its people do not enjoy the same privileges that most Australians now take for granted. This bill, which has been a long time in the making and long overdue, provides that. Norfolk Island has been the subject of many reviews over many years and this bill is the culmination of all that work. The bill amends the Norfolk Island Act 1979 to strengthen the island's electoral, financial, governance and administration framework to ensure a more transparent, equitable and economically stable future for Norfolk Island. This is particularly important. Despite what was said before, the changes are not radical and they are supported by the Norfolk Island government, as the member of Stirling has pointed out to us just now. They also do not erode the Norfolk Island government's ability to selfgovern. Those powers are still there. What it it does is strengthen a range of economic, financial and governance elements to ensure the future of Norfolk Island. The bill provides a clearer approach for Norfolk Island's administration. The bill provides a clearer understanding of Norfolk Island's financial position. The bill articulates conventions and clarifies roles and responsibilities. The bill allows for greater Commonwealth oversight of Norfolk Island legislation to ensure compliance with our international obligations and other areas of national interest. The bill modernises Norfolk Island's governance and harmonises it with the rest of Australia. The global financial crisis underscored the need for greater transparency in matters financial and regulatory and this bill brings a modern framework to the island-a modern framework that has been operating on mainland Australia for years, if not decades. I have only been to Norfolk Island once and my visit was brief. It was earlier this year. But in that short time and since my election I have managed to get a very broad overview of the issues that are confronting the island and understand the need for reform. There needs to be reform in a number of areas. I am looking forward to going back there in December to attend a women's forum with my colleague Senator Kate Lundy. The women on the island have a strong tradition of being opinionated and strong and I am really looking forward to getting the opportunity to meet with a number of them and talking to them about a range of social policy issues. I am sure the reform issue will also discussed in those meetings. While Norfolk Island has had self-government for decades, these reforms will close the gap between the conditions we enjoy on mainland Australia that we take for granted-and those experienced on the island. For the benefit of the House I would like to take a moment to outline the complex and fascinating governance road that has led us to this point. Norfolk Island was not occupied when it was mapped by Captain Cook in 1774, although there was evidence of early Polynesian settlement. Between 1788 and 1814, and again between 1824 and 1855, the British used the island as a penal colony. In 1856, the descendants of the Bounty mutineers-the history is just fascinating-who had married Polynesian islanders agreed with the British government to move from Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island, and the descendants of those seven families are still there today. Meeting them you really do feel as if you are touching the past-it is quite extraordinary. Going to the graveyards down on the beach where the penal colony used to be is also quite extraordinary, reaching back into history and having descendants of those people actually telling you about the history of their families. Between 1856 and 1897, Norfolk Island was a separate British colony with its own governor, who also happened to be the Governor of New South Wales. In 1897, the Crown transferred administrative responsibility of the island to the colony of New South Wales and on 1 July 1914 the island became Australia's second external territory under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia. But it was not until the mid-1970s, and following a royal commission into the future status of the island, that the Fraser government passed the quasi-constitutional Norfolk Island Act in 1979 and committed to self-government. The act enabled the terribe tory to be self-governed and administered by an administrator with three essential functions. These are to represent the Crown, similar to a state Governor General's role; to represent the Commonwealth on the island and communicate between the federal government and the government of Norfolk Island; and to act in any specified statutory capacity as conferred by either the Norfolk Island government or the Commonwealth. The act also establishes the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island and grants them powers to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the island, including laws to raise taxes and impose charges. It is an old hangover, but one of the reasons you need a passport is the old Customs Act. What we are suggesting here with the reforms is not in any way imposing on these powers; it is just reform and good governance. This means the assembly has the capacity to legislate for all things except coinage, the raising of a defence force, the acquisition of property on other than just terms and euthanasia. Once the assembly enacts a law, the Norfolk Island government is equipped with broad executive powers and responsibilities to administer and enforce that law. That said, there have been several reviews and reports into the governance of Norfolk Island over recent years, arising from concerns that the island was falling behind the modern frameworks that apply on the mainland; hence this bill. Probably the most significant was the 2003 report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. As I said, this reform is long overdue and has been a long time in the making. It was seven years ago and we are just finally talking about this and hopefully getting it through now seven years later. The recommendations of this report were delayed by the Howard Government, and I welcome the Gillard Government's commitment to progressing reform. Labor has a strong tradition of reform and this is just another one. What the report suggested was not a dramatic, radical, revolutionary change, as has been suggested, to the way things are done in Norfolk Island. Instead, the review advocated greater financial transparency. What is so radical about that- reform to the electoral system, improved auditing and reporting, and an extension of basic administrative rights, fundamental and tested aspects of good governance? The bill largely relies on the joint commit- bly. tee's recommendations and it will reform four key areas. The first is in the electoral sphere. The bill will create greater electoral stability, aid in the implementation of legislaadvice tion and bring the Norfolk Island system more into line with the Westminster system. The bill introduces changes that will give greater certainty about when elections are held, with set minimum and maximum fixed terms; more clearly outline the roles, titles and responsibilities of elected representatives-for instance, executive members will now be called ministers; prescribe a process for selecting and dismissing a Chief Minister and ministers; entrench the separation of executive and non-executive positions by providing for a maximum number of ministers to ensure effective backbench scrutiny; and codify current practices. Just read this. This is really radical! The bill will also establish a no-confidence motion process for the Chief Minister and enable the making of regulations for changes to the electoral system. The second key reform is in the area of financial management. The bill establishes a tailored financial framework to ensure responsible management of public money and property, preparation of budgets, financial reporting, annual reports and procurement. It appoints a Commonwealth Financial Officer for Norfolk Island to manage this framework. It clarifies the definitions of public money and public property of the territorymodelled on the FMA Act that applies here-and establishes a territory authority to provide a complete picture of the island's financial position. It ensures the Norfolk Island finance minister prepares annual financial statements-a significant plank in any efficient and effective financial management-and it ensures the Commonwealth Auditor-General now conducts audits of Norfolk Island's financial statements, which must be tabled in the Norfolk Island assemThe third key reform is in the area of governance. The bill allows the Norfolk Island Administrator to access a greater range of when presented with bills for assent to ensure consistency of compliance and it allows the Governor General and the federal minister responsible for territories to take a more active role in the introduction and passage of Norfolk Island legislation. The final reform is in the critical area administration. The bill applies the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act to Norfolk Island to ensure a high-quality, independent merit review process. It applies the Freedom of Information Act to Norfolk Island, so now the people of Norfolk Island can enjoy the same right to access information that has applied here for decades. It ensures the Commonwealth Ombudsman assumes the function of the Norfolk Island Ombudsman under Norfolk Island legislation. It requires Norfolk Island public sector agencies to adhere to the information privacy principles in the same way as Australian government public sector agencies. It ensures Norfolk Island public servants adhere to a set of values. It has been suggested that a community of 1,500 will find this onerous to manage. There are government agencies that have only 1,500-small government agencies that are applying not just the FMA Act but a whole raft of Commonwealth legislation. They have not crumbled under the weight of that, so I find that whole notion derstand. I welcome the Gillard government's reforms to the governance, financial and electoral management and administration of Norfolk Island outlined in this bill, and I would like to thank the various members of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories that have reviewed Norfolk Island issues over the years-particularly for their patience in waitis ing all this time. These reforms continue the agenda that Labor has been rolling out in infrastructure, health, education, the economy and climate change. I would particularly like to thank the committee for consulting with the Norfolk Island community to inform their recommendations in a rigorous yet inclusive way. I know that some think the reforms go too far and others think they do not go far enough. Whatever the view, I am of pleased the community has had a chance to have its say. I would also like to acknowledge my fellow Canberran Senator Kate Lundy for the great work she has done as a former chair of the committee. She did great work on this issue for a long time. The Commonwealth has an ongoing responsibility to the Australian citizens of Norfolk Island. This bill is an important step in strengthening transparency and accountability to ensure the future good governance of Norfolk Island and continues the tradition of reform of Labor governments. I am particularly pleased that the Norfolk Island government recently came out in support of the passage of the bill. I congratulate Chief Minister David Buffett and the Norfolk Island government for recognising the need for reform. The government came out recently and supported the bill in to to. There were no particular elements that they said would be all too hard. This is an important step in ensuring Norfolk Island is a sustainable, just and equal part of Australia into the 21st century hard to un- and I support this bill.",153
215,Mr SIMPKINS,TERRITORIES LAW REFORM,"I certainly welcome this opportunity to make comments on the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010. It was a long time ago, back in 1979, that I travelled to and visited Norfolk Island. I think it was for around about 10 days. This is without doubt one of the most spectacular and beautiful places in Australia. It has at times rugged countryside but there also the greenery and the norfolk pines. It is a spectacular place-a real oasis, in many ways, not too far from the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It is a long way from Australia. The beauty that is Norfolk Island belies the past and the white history of places like Kingston, where the penal colony was established. Although there is nothing more than cattle grazing there now, it is certainly the case that these places saw some of the great excesses of convict habitation and convict work. Back in 1979 on a school excursion we stayed not very far from Burnt Pine. One of the great joys of visiting Norfolk Island was just how friendly people were. As part of this school excursion we hired pushbikes for the whole time we were there and every time you went anywhere, if you were at the bottom of a hill, someone would stop and ask you whether you wanted to throw your bike in the back of the ute and carry on with a lift up the hill. It is a very nice place, a beautiful place with very nice and accommodating people. As I said, it is a real oasis. It is also interesting to reflect a little on the history of Norfolk Island. Apart from the convict colony, they also had a terrible experience with the introduction of rabbits. Someone came up with the good idea, over 150 years ago, that if you introduced rabbits to a place called Phillip Island not far off the coast of Norfolk Island then that would be a great place to go hunting. Unfortunately, rabbits being rabbits they overtook the place. So now if you look out across the water across Kingston you can see a very brown and barren island. That was certainly my recollection of Phillip Island from those days. But I do welcome this opportunity to talk on the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010 which, in the main, amends the Norfolk Island Act 1979 in order to implement significant reforms aimed at improving governance structures and strengthening the accountability mechanisms for Norfolk Island. And I welcome this opportunity as I have recently become the deputy chair of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. Given that the vast majority of this bill concerns the external territory of Norfolk Island, I will contain my comments to the changes that this act will effect to that territory rather than comment on the more routine changes that the bill will enact with regard to Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. I sought a position on the joint committee because I have a long standing interest in the territories, having lived in Canberra for around six years of my life when I was in the Army and before that with the Australian Federal Police. As I said, in 1979 I was part of a high school excursion that visited Norfolk Island, and I certainly look forward to returning to Norfolk and visiting the other external territories if the business of the committee should require it in this the 43rd Parliament. In the short term, however, after beginning to read into the work of the committee of the 42nd Parliament and being aware of issues in the past regarding governance of Norfolk Island, I appreciate the need for amending the Norfolk Island Actalthough, as has been foreshadowed by the shadow minister, there is the need for minor amendments, which I wholeheartedly support. Before speaking briefly on the bill itself, I would say, in support of the coalition's amendments, that if we speak of governance and accountability, such a debate must include the extension of Freedom of Information Act application to Norfolk Island. That being said, a model that reflects the scale of the administration is more appropriately required. In the same way that the role of Commonwealth Ombudsman was embraced in their own legislation, Norfolk Island should seek and legislate for a model of freedom of information and privacy that does reflect the size of the island and the administration so that the bureaucracy is not vastly increased, and this is the point made in paragraph 1.3 of the committee's recent report into the proposed legislation. In terms of this bill itself I would like to address the proposed amendments that the bill foreshadows. In reading the 2010 committee report it is clear that there were significant concerns raised by observers and local people about the way in which the island was being governed, as well as concern about the power and influence being exerted at the time submissions were being received and evidence was being taken. Indeed, at footnote 17 in chapter 2 there is mention of fear and apprehension holding back residents who wanted to make submissions. The committee found: It has become increasingly clear that beneath surface, informal mechanisms are being allowed to operate with impunity. The Committee is aware of growing community concern over the activities of these elements. The committee also expressed concern about such a negative culture-one that has been referred to as ‘the Norfolk way'-which is equated as similar to ‘the Pacific way'. We need to be very careful that a particular way by which things are done locally should not constitute an excuse for corrupt practices, favouritism and nepotism. It is good to see this bill come before the House. Clearly the joint standing committee in its report also saw the need for significant governance, financial and administrative reforms, and this bill now brings those amendments to this parliament. I will now take the opportunity to speak of the amendments that relate to schedule 1 of the bill. Firstly, under clause 14 of the bill, the matter of termination of the position of Chief Minister and other ministers is covered. In particular, clause 14A states that the Administrator can dismiss the Chief Minister if, in the Administrator's opinion, there are exceptional circumstances that justify that action. That power is pretty similar to the existing powers of the Governor General for the national government. I have read the submission by the Norfolk Island government where they object to that change, yet it is really working to the same principles that the rest of Australia adheres to. But I also note that the bill provides for the ability of the responsible Commonwealth minister to appoint deputy administrators for Norfolk Island. Again, this is a change that I support, and it will provide the federal government, and specifically the responsible minister, with the ability to react to the needs of the population of this territory of Australia. In reading through the bill I would particularly like to note the additions to the Northe folk Island Act that relate to division 2, regarding financial management and accountability. Clause 48A will require the appropriation of annual budgets by the island's finance minister and they will need to be in accordance with the Commonwealth's orders and regulations and provided to the responsible Commonwealth minister. Again, I fully support the amendment contained in the bill, even while I understand that the Norfolk Island government is not particularly happy about it. Similarly, the other amendments include, under clause 48B, the need for financial statements; under clause 48C, the auditing of those statements; and other subclauses of clause 48 that will improve the accountability and the performance of the Norfolk Island government and administration. Indeed, even the section 51 amendments contained in this bill require the Commonwealth be kept informed and, from what I have read, these changes appear to be appropriate at this time. This clearly represents the establishment of a customised and proportionate financial framework which provides for the responsible management of public money and public property and for the preparation of budgets, financial reporting, annual reports and procurement. I should also mention that this includes the appointment by the Commonwealth of a Commonwealth financial officer for Norfolk Island should the position be required. This bill will also allow the Norfolk Island Administrator to access a greater range of advice when presented with bills for assent under schedule 2 of the Norfolk Island Act. It will allow the Governor General and the minister responsible for territories to take a more active role in the introduction and passage of Norfolk Island legislation. It will reform the voting system for the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly and provide more certainty about when elections are to be held. It will also allow access, under certain situations, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, which will confer on the AAT merit review jurisdiction for specified decisions under Norfolk Island legislation. Before concluding I would like to speak about the freedom of information and privacy amendments to the bill proposed by the shadow minister, the member for Stirling. I support these amendments and note what the Norfolk Island government said in their first supplementary submission, submission 6.1, to the committee. The submission raises the issues of when and how the Norfolk Island public sector could cope with implementing an FOI system. What is therefore required is the ability to access documents and information that are in the public interest. The coalibut tion's amendments would enable the Norfolk Island government to determine in their own legislation the model which best suits their needs. Clearly, the Commonwealth must look at this in the future to ascertain that system fits the needs of the population. From what I have read of Norfolk Island's governance, financial and overall administrative arrangements, there is a need for reform. It is clearly a widely held but not unanimous view that the existing arrangements are not serving the best interests of all residents of the island. It would appear that there are some people on the island who seek to preserve existing arrangements that favour a select few groups, rather than seeking to ensure that self-government arrangements are completely open, accountable and work for the whole population. Critics of the legislation suggest that it is an attack on self government. I do not see that in the analysis. This legislation is about good and effective government which is in the interests of everyone on Norfolk Island. I support this bill with the amendments as stated by the member for Stirling. I also look forward to having an opportunity as part of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories to assess the implementation of these legislative changes, which, I am sure, will lead to much more effective government for Norfolk Island. All laws are capable of being amended, and in the future Norfolk Island can expect visits by representatives of this government and this parliament, by ministers and, most certainly, by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. Fundamentally, the Commonwealth will want to be assured that Norfolk Island shares the same governance, financial, administrative and electoral standards as the rest of Australia. If that is the case, then the laws may not need to be amended in the future, if it is not the case then maybe they will need to be amended. In conclusion, from my limited visit to Norfolk Island of about 10 days back in 1979 and from what I have read, I see that there is the a lot for the people of Norfolk Island to be very proud of. It is a beautiful island and a beautiful environment, but we, the Commonwealth parliament, need to be certain that the interests of all members of the Norfolk Island community are properly looked after and that there are accountability and governance that are working for the whole population and not for any special interest groups. In the future, we will have an opportunity to continue to look at Norfolk Island to make sure that what this legislation intends is achieved. I look forward to participating as the deputy chair of the committee and to working with my colleagues on both sides of parliament to make sure that Norfolk Island is as good as it can be.",156
216,Ms GAMBARO,TERRITORIES LAW REFORM,"I also rise to speak on the Territories Law Reform Bill 2010. Norfolk Island would have to be one of the most beautiful parts of the world. It is one of Australia's most geographically isolated communities as well as being one of its oldest territories. It has an incredible history. We have heard various contributions today about the early days and the colonies of Van Diemen's Land, now Tasmania, and New South Wales, and also of the very proud history of Norfolk Island, particularly that of the Pitcairn descendants. They form a very strong part of Australia's heritage and culture. Norfolk Island has had a very long history. It is very progressive: in 1838 it gave women over the age of 18 the vote. It has very strong cultural ties which are very distinct from Australia and has its own language. There has been a great deal of history, particularly its convict past. Many of the roads were built by convicts. There are thousands of native trees, as well as lemon and guava trees. In the old days there were a chief magistrate and jury running the island. Islanders have also had a rather lackadaisical taxation system, one which would probably be the envy of most countries. They have to give one week's labour out of seven months to any public works that need to be done. They also have a unique system of accepting anyone who becomes a permanent resident. They have to be pretty much prescribed by two-thirds of anyone over 20 who can read and write and have to be accepted by the whole community. I have not had the opportunity to visit Norfolk Island, but from those whom I have spoken to about Norfolk Island there is one thing that is universally agreed upon: its beauty and its unspoilt nature. It is one of the most beautiful islands. I hope to some day get the opportunity to travel to Norfolk Island and meet with some of the locals but also to learn a little bit about this proud and wonderful history. I know that the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories has done so.",160

219,Mr FITZGIBBON,PAIRS,"Hunter) (8.11 pm)Very briefly, on indulgence: Mr Speaker, I witnessed some confusion just before the unofficial dinner break about divisions. I do not raise this matter to in any way be discourteous to anyone, but I do remind all members of the House that while we have an unofficial dinner break-a period during which no divisions occur-it is still necessary for those seeking a division to call a division before that time arrives. So, for the clarification of members, I want them to understand that it is still necessary to call a division even though we might be going into the dinner break.",161
220,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,The point that the Chief Government Whip raises is well put. There is still an obligation to seek a division and then the division is deferred. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Same-Sex Marriage,161
221,Mr BANDT,PAIRS,I ask leave of the House to amend the notice relating to same-sex marriage in the terms circulated to honourable members in the chamber.,162
222,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,Is there any objection to leave being granted? Mr Ruddock-I have not seen the amendment.,162
223,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,I will get a copy to you as soon as I can get you one. It is coming.,162
224,Unknown,PAIRS,Honourable members interjecting,162
225,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Could the Deputy Clerk stop the clock, please. We will do this correctly procedurally so that everybody can be happy. Is there any objection to leave ing granted? I am in the position where the honourable member for Melbourne has sought leave to amend his motion and I am seeking an indication from the House whether leave is granted. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-There is much uncertainty in the chamber as to the nature the change that the honourable member wishes to move. It does seem that the proposed amendment is quite different in substance from the original motion moved. That is the perception that is being discussed formally in the chamber. For clarification purposes, could you read out the original motion and then read out the proposed amendment so that the House can be informed.",162
226,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The motion is as circulated in the Notice Paper. The amended motion is now being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. There is a oneparagraph suggestion of an amendment. Is there any objection to leave being granted? Mr Entsch-As a point of clarification, given that this was basically put on just before we were expected to speak on it, the original motion in relation to (a) and (b) has now been removed from it. This now replaces the entire one and in effect it is No. 2. Can I seek clarification on that.",162
227,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Without my getting into interpreting the motion, the original motion was in two parts. The second part was a call upon parliamentarians to gauge certain things. Basically, that is the amended motion that leave is sought for. Mr Entsch-Can I assume that No. 1 stands, or is No. 1 now deleted and No. 2 becomes the motion?",162
228,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The original motion in totality had two parts. The amended motion, as circulated, is the whole motion, as I understand it. I will get clarification from the be- member for Melbourne that the oneparagraph motion is the proposed amended motion that he wishes to place before the House. It is a single one-paragraph motion and all the rest in the first part of the original motion is no longer what he is proposing. I am only allowing this because of the excepof tional circumstances of this present parliament. This is not something that I will be in a position to allow in future. We must bring this aspect to a resolution. Is leave granted for the member for Melbourne to move the in- motion as he has proposed and circulated, which is a one-paragraph motion? Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-I have a point of order. The original motion-and the people who are listening to the broadcast are entitled to know-in part (b) calls on all parliamentarians to gauge their constituents' views on the issue of marriage equality. The proposed amendment says: The House calls on all parliamentarians, consistent with their duties as representatives, to gauge their constituents' views on ways to achieve equal treatment for same-sex couples, including marriage. Which is a totally different concept from the one originally moved. Ordinary rules of debate tell me that it is a departure from the substantive motion as originally moved and therefore would be out of order. I ask, Mr Speaker, if you could rule on that, apart from the question of leave, because quite frankly this has been brought on at the last moment, when the issue had been canvassed before. There was no consultation and I feel that it is a difficulty in the circumstances for a proper decision on whether leave should be granted or not to be reached.",162
229,The SPEAKER,PAIRS,To give certainty about what we are looking at I will rule on that point-and this is an advisory ruling-and say that if leave were granted for this proposed amended motion I would see it as being in order. Is leave granted? Leave not granted.,163
230,Mr BANDT,PAIRS,"I move the motion relating to same-sex marriage in the terms in which it appears on the Notice Paper: That this House: (1) notes that there is: (a) a growing list of countries that allow same-sex couples to marry including the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Spain, Canada and South Africa; and (b) widespread support for equal marriage in the Australian community; and (2) calls on all parliamentarians to gauge their constituents' views on the issue of marriage equality. Love knows no boundaries. Love knows no limits. And love knows when it has found its partner. There have been many attempts through history to limit love. All have failed. As we move further into the 21st century, I am confident that attempts to limit love will fail again and that full marriage equality will become a reality. This motion before the parliament does not seek to overturn the Howard government's change to the Marriage Act which sought to limit marriage to a few. My colleague Senator Sarah Hanson-Young has a bill before parliament that, when passed, will amend the Marriage Act to enshrine the right for all Australians to marry regardless of their gender or sexuality. In time the Greens will move for that bill to be debated. But with this motion we seek to provide an opportunity for members of parliament, the media and, most importantly, the community to discuss the importance of marriage equality. The motion is not binding on members of parliament or the government. Its passage will not in itself legally endorse or ratify the right to marriage equality. Rather it will acknowledge the reality of community opinion in Australia, which has changed. In moving this motion, the Greens want parliament to acknowledge that Australian public opinion is changing. We also want parliament to acknowledge that change is happening around the world. We want those who are still stuck in the old way of thinking to go out and engage with the people in their electorates to find out where they are now at. I welcome my colleagues who have chosen to participate in this debate today and I am encouraged by the fact that many more MPs would have spoken today if we had more time for speaking spots rather than the 10 we were able to allocate. I am also encouraged by the number of members of parliament, including ministers, who have indicated their support for marriage equality through the media. Some of them have raised the prospect of bringing forward their party conference to change policy. I am also encouraged by suggestions and support by various members for a friendship group that could progress these issues. This is all welcome. However, I would say that there is no need for such delay. If the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition were willing to shift direction, we could change the law right now. It is especially disappointing that the Prime Minister and the government continue to hold on to 20th century thinking on matters of love when the community is so far ahead of them. We know that the community has progressed. Recent polling shows that the majority of Australians support a move to full equality for marriage. When the Greens' Marriage Equality Amendment Bill was considered by a Senate inquiry, over 25,000 submissions were received. We know that there are many small groups who are well organised and well resourced and that they will continue to speak out very loudly in favour of discrimination. But it is a mistake to think that, because they speak loudly, they speak for everyone. I would ask members concerned about those groups to have a look at today's analysis of community attitudes appearing in the Fairfax press. What it suggests for those sitting in this House by virtue of a small margin is that the well-organised old-world lobby groups are not engaging the voters in your seats. Instead what you will find there, as Mark Davis writes, is that ‘permarriage haps the marginal seats are not as fussed by gay marriage as the politicians think'. That means the time is right to make this change. There are now so many people wanting to marry but whose love the law says cannot be recognised, and there are their friends and family members. It is these people whom this debate is ultimately about-the many, many people who want to marry and cannot because their partner is of the same sex and the many, many people whose sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, grandmothers and grandfathers, friends and neighbours all know someone who wants to be married but cannot because of this archaic legal discrimination. Today the online campaigning group GetUp! asked couples to submit their photos and their stories of why they want to be married. Tony Bannister wrote: The attached photo is of my beautiful partner Paul Walters & I. We have been together as a couple for over 13 years. We are committed to each other, our families and our friends. We have busy, successful careers, have a number of properties which we co-jointly own and we live our lives, just like most other ‘married' couples in harmony with each other in a caring and loving way. What we don't have is a recognition of our partnership in terms of legally or equality. Not only is this discriminating as to what this means to ours and others relationships but I strongly believe that this is at the root of discrimination in terms of educating our children that same sex partnership, marriage and unions are just as equal, loving and right as our parents and friends. Anyone we are connected to, from parents to friends to work colleagues, can see that what we have is no different from what they have yet agree that we should have the same rights and protections. Until this happens we are living in a world of ignorance and intolerance. That is an important point. When one considers what the arguments against same-sex are, it can only devolve to the basic proposition that there are two groups of people in Australia, one of which deserves more rights than others. When you have a young boy in a country town who is struggling with his sexuality, or a girl in a city school, for us in this parliament to be sending the message that there are two classes of people is completely unjustifiable and will not promote full equality in our community. The examples on the GetUp! website are just a few of the thousands of Australians who want to be married but are barred by the Howard government ban. There have been times throughout history when the civil rights of the group of people have been violated, often with legal sanction. Many of those struggles continue. The struggle to end discrimination and for full equality for LGBTI people did not begin with marriage equality and it will not end when it is achieved, but it is an important turning point for that struggle. There is a famous aphorism ‘Love conquers all'. As I said in my opening remarks, love is a powerful force and it is a powerful force for good. It is the power of love that has brought us to this moment in the debate over marriage equality, and it is the power of love that will force this parliament and this country to face the reality of what marriage and love mean in the 21st century. I know that some people have said that they do not need a motion to go and engage with their constituents and get their views. But what this motion does is ask members of this place to recognise that community attitudes have moved on. It is a call from those of us who believe in full equality to the rest of the members of this place to go and talk to the people in their communities and find out that their attitudes have changed. I commend this motion to the House. I know that this motion will not be the last step in the struggle for equality. This motion will not bind members to do certain things; this motion will not result in a change in the law. What will do is take another important step in the struggle for what some senators and members on the government benches have acknowledged is inevitable law reform in this country. I comment this motion.",163
231,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Wilkie-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,165
232,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"Berowra) (8.30 pm)The motion that we have before us needs to be read with the remarks of the honourable member. It is quite clear that the honourable member is seeking support for fundamental change to the law of Australia in relation to marriage. The opposition has a clear position on that question, and that is that it believes that marriage is a union between a man and a woman and that the opposition does not support any change to Commonwealth law that would diminish the institution of marriage and will continue to oppose any action that would alter that status. Having said that, let me make it clear that over a period of time there has been consideration of this issue. There was consideration by the High Court of Australia. It looked at the question as to what we mean when we refer to marriage. The court opined-and I notice that people pay great respect to the views of our court-that marriage is between a man and a woman. In fact, in May 2004 when I was Attorney-General I introduced the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill to prevent any possible further court rulings allowing same-sex marriages. The law was amended accordingly and it put beyond doubt the definition: marriage is a union between a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life. There have been other times when the matter has been the subject of discussion. The states have recognised that you can esit tablish a basis for civil unions for same-sex couples in which there is a recognition of the union between people that is very similar to the union that many others make-that is, a de facto relationship, which does not involve a marriage but which does carry certain rights and responsibilities. A de facto relationship would to all intents and purposes be for a same-sex couple very similar in its genesis in terms of the rights and responsibilities. I have often been asked why it is that there is so much emphasis upon a union being between a man and a woman. It is seen that marriage has been ordained over a long period of time as a basis for ensuring that a union that can give rise to the procreation of children is the subject of some regularity and order, particularly when the ongoing care of those children becomes relevant when there might be differences of view as to whether or not the relationship should continue. It is in that context that we have law dealing with marriage break-up and law which primarily has as its focus the issue of how children are dealt with. There has been a view over a long period of time in this country that in relation to children, while it cannot always be the case-for example, if there has been a death or other similar circumstance-that it is desirable that children have the role model of both a father and a mother available to them and influencing their upbringing and that is the preferable model for this country. It is self-evident that same-sex couples are unlikely to have children other than by the adoption of a child of one of those people in the union by another party or, if adoption same-sex couple over a man and a woman was permitted, which would generally would be seen as being less desirable in the context of the law dealing with adoption, where there are so few children available. I make the point that there are arguments that have carried a great deal of weight over a period of time that marriage should be for a man and a woman only and it not be available to samesex couples. But it should not be seen that the arguments that I put mean that I believe that there should be overt discrimination against same-sex couples. In fact, I have overseen a great deal of the work that gave rise to the development of the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-Superannuation) Act 2008. A lot of that work was done initially under the Howard government when the Law Reform Commission was looking at these matters. The Howard government wanted to see how we could progress the elimination of all those forms of discrimination which had been in place over a long period of time. I ought to make it clear that I supported very strongly the relevant legislation that brought about those changes in 2008. It brought them about in a number of areas: taxation; superannuation; defined superannuation benefits; social security and family assistance; the PBS safety net and the Medicare safety net; aged care arrangements; child support, where that was relevant; citizenship and veterans' affairs. Even in relation to immigration, I played a very early role in supporting measures that enabled same-sex partners to be reunited in Australia in circumstances where one partner was a resident and the other was not in Australia. Those changes, while they were not recognised on the basis of marriage or a de facto relationship, were like for same-sex couples as for the others. So I make the point that this is not a suggestion that we should have disto a crimination against same-sex couples in the wide range of other areas. I thought it was important that we were able to reform private-sector superannuation arrangements to ensure that same-sex couples could receive reversionary benefits. Similarly, I thought that for defined superannuation benefits, death benefits should be able to be conferred on same-sex partners. I think it was appropriate in the public sector. The best known case was that of Justice Michael Kirby. Changes were made so that his partner was able to benefit from the judges' pension arrangements. Equally, in relation to social security and family assistance, reforms were initiated that ensured that same-sex couples were recognised as couples and consequently would receive benefits on the same basis that opposite-sex couples, as the explanatory memorandum referred to them, received them. Likewise, the PBS safety net and the Medicare safety net arrangements, whereby samesex couples previously could not access Medicare or pharmaceutical benefits as a family, were amended. So I want to put beyond doubt that this is a measure that, if opposed, accommodates a view that people are opposed to same-sex couples being able to access benefits and other programs in the same way as married or de facto couples do. This is a very narrow issue that relates to the way marriage is defined. It is not designed to stop those who are described as being in love from being in a de facto relationship in the same way as other de facto couples are. All it does is recognise that marriage has always been seen to be different and that that basis ought to be kept, primarily because marriage deals with issues that arise when children can possibly be conceived.

233,Mr STEPHEN JONES,PAIRS,"I rise to move the following amendment to Mr Bandt's motion on same-sex marriage: That all the words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “this House calls on all parliamentarians, consistent with their duties as representatives, to gauge constituents' views on ways to achieve equal treatment for same sex couples including marriage”. I wish to make a few observations about the amendment. The first observation is that I do not pretend to be an early activist on this issue. When I think about the issues that I campaigned on this year, they were about dealing with youth unemployment, which stands at around 14 per cent in my area, reforming our economy to make it more sustainable and preserving our planet for future generations. It was about improving infrastructure and access to health and education services. Now, having focused on the issue and having applied the core Labor values of equality, fairness and dignity, I believe that there is a case for change. Indeed, it was these values that led Labor, in its first term, to conduct an exhaustive review of all Commonwealth laws to identify and remove all areas of discrimination against same-sex couples. In the last parliament the Labor government amended 86 separate pieces of legislation to this end. The second observation is that if change is to occur it must be built on community consensus. If legislation is to be changed it will require consensus, which will require more votes than any single party can muster in this chamber. That will not be achieved by a heroic dash but by careful advocacy that respects different views, respectfully. On this issue there are different views. There are some who, on theological grounds, believe that to celebrate marriage of two men or two women is an affront to their religion. I have thought carefully about this objection, and I cannot help but draw the conclusion that the real objection here is not to the marriage but to the relationship. We can be thankful that we live in a society in which those who hold this view are as free to hold it as I am to say, respectfully, their that I do not agree. We on the Labor side are opposed to discrimination. This opposition is grounded in the value of fairness and equity, and we are opposed to treating people differently because of gender, race, religion or sexual preference. There are others who argue that same-sex marriage is an affront to tradition. I have more sympathy for this argument because I am a great believer in the importance of tradition. It is often the stuff that binds us together, but it can also be the stuff that excludes and impedes genuine progress. We in this place must be very careful of mindless genuflection to tradition, because traditions change over time. There have been many matrimonial traditions which we now think of as absurd, if not abhorrent. Betrothal, dowry and a wife's matrimonial vow of obedience to husband come to mind as examples. The third observation I would make is that marriage is an important institution in our society. It is a special relationship where two people say to each other and to the rest of the world that they agree to be bound together in love, exclusive of all others, for life. I believe it would diminish us all as a society if we were to say that we may exclude gay and lesbian couples from this celebration. That marks them as somehow less worthy or even as biological oddities. I respect the right of religious organisations and others in our community to disagree with this view and to continue to practise in accordance with their beliefs. Indeed, no motion or act of this place can of itself change those beliefs. But it is an entirely different thing to ask of the state to enforce it. Finally, I come to this place as a representative of my party and my electorate. I will advocate for change, but I will do that in my electorate and in accordance with the rules and processes of my party in this parliament. (Time expired)",167
234,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Is the amendment seconded? Ms Grierson-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,168
235,Mr BILSON,PAIRS,"Dunkley) (8.46 pm)Madam Acting Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the debate tonight on the member for Melbourne's private member's motion. It originally sought to convey some current information about international trends and domestic opinions about same-sex marriage and it urges members to engage with constituents about community views. Email traffic that I have received, though, has interpreted the member's motion as being more about moving forward with equal recognition for all couples and a call for marriage equality. Others included one sent to me and presented as being from the webeditor@greensmps.org.au and actually coming from me, which I found quite amusing. I got an email from myself, which I did not write, that claimed that this motion was a ‘dangerous proposal' which would undermine society. Clearly, what the motion says-and the manoeuvres on the amendments tonight are one thing-and what many people believe it is actually about vary greatly. Tonight the motion has been varied on the floor, and we are now discussing a different subject. But with the vast majority of the communications I have had on this motion being about the broader topic of same-sex marriage, this is where I will focus my remarks. As I have previously stated, I do not support the definition of marriage being altered to include same-sex couples. I believe that marriage is a union between a man and a woman and I do not support any change to Commonwealth law that could diminish the institution. I would be supportive of a national register of civil unions and relationships that clearly captures and conveys the dignified and honoured status of a committed and durable relationship between two adults that can be witnessed by family, friends and a broader community. Countries with civil unions and registered partnership legislation include Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Greenland, Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and at least 10 states in the United States. This of course is an avenue open to Australia, and I urge its examination. I encourage an examination of civil unions and registered partnerships as a pathway that would afford an opportunity for special and dignified status and state sanctioned honour in a manner that I believe would engender public support and confidence. In my view public support and confidence matters. As public attitudes evolve, support for the continuing evolution and nurturing of this public view is important if moves are to be supported by the public. A celebration or a public commitment in the form of a marriage is one form of expression of the form, character, quality and durability of a relationship. is no impediment to having other relationships that are part of a public commitment and celebrated in another form, with another character, another quality and other durability. But the important thing is that if we are to move forward with this recognition we cannot do so by diminishing the sense of right and designation that people who have married have chosen for themselves. It is quite ironic that this charge for rights is being sued by diminishing the rights of those who have chosen to designate their relationship a traditional marriage. I do not understand that logic. People who have entered into a marriage as it is defined and recognised under the law, whether it be by way of tradition, custom, conservatism or religious orientation, have done so consciously, knowing that that is the designation they have sought, that that will be the designation they will secure and that the nature of the relationship they have entered into will be recognised as such by the broader community. We should not seek to remove that from people who have chosen that pathway and have operated within the current definition of marriage, which I agree with. What we should aim to do is offer another pathway, one that is a public commitment also, a celebration, an expression of the form, character, quality and durability of a same-sex relationship. But it does not need to appropriate the definition and the title of ‘marriage'. Let us call it something else. Let us grant the desire for recognition that some want. In conversations with my friends and the local community, the gay community are not as one on this voice. Many convey to me a belief in the importance and the quality of the relationship, not the title or the moniker that it attracts. Those in a traditional marriage hold fast to that distinction because that is a definition they chose for themselves. A It pathway forward should be able to accommodate both. (Time expired)",168
236,Ms GRIERSON,PAIRS,"I rise to speak on the private member's motion put forward by the member for Melbourne and to support the amendment by the member for Throsby that ‘this House calls on all parliamentarians, consistent with their duties as representatives, to gauge their constituents' views on ways to achieve equal treatment for same-sex couples including pur- marriage'. I personally welcome the specific inclusion of marriage in the amendment. That is where the debate is in our communities. I want to speak on this motion for several reasons: first, to demonstrate that this is a mainstream issue which affects many people who live in my electorate and in every electorate across Australia. This is not an issue confined to same-sex couples or to any particular lifestyle or to any particular place of residence. This is an issue that goes to the core of the human experience: the need to be loved and to love and the need some people feel to have that bond formally recognised in a union called marriage. Although it is my personal view that marriage as a legal construct has some serious limitations, I understand that to many people it is an important milestone in their quest to form a partnership in life based on lasting love and commitment. Second, it requires no elaboration other than to say that, amongst my wider family, friends, colleagues and community and within organisations that I deal with every day as an MP, there are many people in same-sex relationships who would like the right to marry. They would want me to put forward their view and oppose discrimination against them on the basis of their sexual preference and the nature of their relationships. I am pleased to do that tonight. Third, as a heterosexual mother of two heterosexual daughters, I do not come to this debate because of any intimate experience. But I am a mother and I empathise with the mother who emailed me to say that she has two young adult children, one who is married to the person they love and the other who cannot marry the person they love because they are of the same sex. There was a certain poignancy and regret expressed that I would think all mothers and fathers can understand. We hope our children find a special partner in their lives to love and support them as we as parents loved and supported them before they gained their independence. To loving parents, the gender nature of that relationship is secondary, as it should be. And as parents we hope that our children will be able to celebrate that special relationissue: ship with their family and friends. For many, the most important part of that celebration is marriage. Although the Constitution extends to us here the power to legislate on marriage and divorce, the first Marriage Bill introduced into the Commonwealth parliament in 1960 and reintroduced in 1961 did not define who could marry but made bigamy an offence. An attempt at the time to amend the legislation to define marriage as ‘a voluntary union of one man and one woman for life to the exclusion of all others' was defeated 40 votes to eight-a more enlightened time, perhaps. But in 2004 the Howard government introduced two bills which defined marriage as between a man and a woman and clarified that same-sex marriages entered into under the law of another country would not be recognised under Australian law. The then opposition, of which I was a member, supported those changes without division. As is the procedure within the Australian Labor Party, I spoke against that position in caucus but was bound by the caucus decision, based on ALP policy. Within the ALP we continue to apply that collective approach, but similarly I will continue to speak out to eliminate discrimination in all its forms. Tonight's motion is not to change the Marriage Act and it is not a debate to support or oppose same-sex marriage, but it supports honest dialogue in our communities and in our electorates about same-sex marriage, just like the debate that already is occurring. The recent Australian Story program Mum's the Word provoked much debate; the churches are having this same debate; and our community are considering this issue as they confront the reality for their family members, friends and work mates. That is a good thing. To the many, many people-hundreds-from my electorate who have emailed me on this thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. That is a good thing too. I also speak tonight as a member of the Australian Labor Party, a party that historically has brought about equality of opportunity in this country. Labor governments championed opportunity for all and led the way in bringing about fairness and dignity in the workplace. Labor governments delivered strong economic and social reforms to deliver better standards of living in this nation. And it was a Labor government in 2008 that removed discrimination against same-sex couples in 100 Commonwealth laws. That was a phenomenal achievement, one which was overdue and had wide community support. But for same-sex couples the Marriage Act remains the last hurdle in granting them equal rights. So I encourage continued debate within the ALP and within our communities and I personally hope that honest dialogue free from prejudice and intolerance will lead to same-sex marriage being recognised in this country and legislated in this parliament.

237,Mr ENTSCH,PAIRS,"I am very well documented as an advocate for gay rights and the right to equality and tinue to support the cause wholeheartedly. I have many gay friends who have been adversely impacted upon by discrimination in our communities, and I believe that equality should not be determined by one's sexuality under any circumstance. I am aware that there is a growing list of countries allowing same-sex couples to marry, and I agree that we need to gauge constituents' views on the subject of gay marriage. While I support gays and lesbians in having their relationships recognised, I think there are much bigger issues at play that need to be dealt with as a matter of priority. Just some of the issues that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people are facing through federal government discrimination include where some individuals are unable to access the necessary Medicare rebate codes required to provide medical treatment because of the way the government sees their sex. For example, they may have legally changed their sex, in the case of a transgender person, or they may be legally recognised as a male but have physical attributes usually associated with a female, in the case of intersex people. In both cases, where Medicare provides rebates for only men or only women, sex and gender diverse people get caught up in the middle of the red tape. Government departments have refused to recognise that while you were born a man you now live the life of a woman, due to various legal and financial hurdles involved in meeting government requirements. In these cases government communication often still contains the prefix ‘ Mr rather than ‘ Mrs or ‘Miss'. For a transgender woman living in a rural town, this can cause enormous mental anguish as your neighbours find out about your past. There are a range of other issues that face older gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in Australia. Many older people in I conthis community currently accessing agedcare services have lived a lifetime of discrimination and they continue to remain in the closet in aged care, fearful of discrimination, and are therefore largely invisible in the aged-care sector. Because aged-care services have largely not recognised gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender clients, they are forced to return to their closet in old age in the fear of receiving lesser treatment by their aged-care service providers. The transfer of responsibility for aged care from states to the federal government as part of the health and hospitals reform provides a unique opportunity for the federal government to address this issue and ensure that culturally appropriate aged-care services cater for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender older Australians. The definition of de facto spouse within the Sex Discrimination Act is the last remaining definition in federal legislation where there is a distinction between heterosexual de facto couples and same-sex couples. During the 2010 federal campaign it was the Liberal Party that was committed to protecting same-sex couples from discrimination by introducing protections on the grounds of relationship status. The change to include same-sex couples in the Sex Discrimination Act is a minor technical amendment that would bring the Sex Discrimination Act into line with the 2008 reforms passed by the parliament that enjoyed absolute bipartisan support. I might add it was a campaign that I initiated back in 2004 and during the next three years was able to convince both sides of parliament of the value of being able to proceed with the removal of this discrimination. The impact, however, of this amendment would ensure that the benchmark was set across Australia that same-sex de facto couples could not be discriminated against. Another area that also needs to be addressed is that identified by ACON's Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy that same-sex attracted young couples are at significantly higher risk of self-harm and suicidal behaviours, with many factors influencing behaviour. It is important that we deal with that. My point is that we are a long way from correcting much of the urgent issues facing this community before we tackle the recognition of gay unions. We need to get our priorities right. I am very keen to establish a gay, bian, bisexual and transgender parliamentary friendship group where gays and lesbians can have direct access to MPs to discuss issues of direct concern to them. This will us to bring these issues out into the open I believe it is an essential step in moving forward to greater equality. I am in the procthey ess now of establishing that as a cross-party parliamentary friendship group and I encourage all members to participate in that friendreduce ship group. It is a wonderful way of being able to get a greater understanding of these members of our community. (Time expired)",171
238,Mr WILKIE,PAIRS,"I am very pleased to support the motion of the member for Melbourne calling on members to gauge their constituents' views on the sue of marriage equality in Australia. My support for marriage equality is well known. However, for me, this important issue is not just to do with same-sex marriage. It is equality: that everyone, regardless of their gender, race, sexual preference or religion treated the same under Australian law. In essence, I believe passionately that all people are equal and should be treated as such. The fact is that in Australia, if you are a man and a woman and not married to anyone else, you can go and get married, but if you are a man and a man you cannot. The same situation applies if you are a woman wanting to marry a woman. In other words, the law is not treating people equally. It is legislated discrimination that treats some lovers as second-class citizens simply because of the people they want to marry. And that is not fair. Australia's history has other examples of legislated discrimination. For instance, if you were living in Australia a little more than 100 years ago and you were a woman, you simply could not vote. It was less than 50 years ago that, if you were a woman working in the Public Service in Australia, when you got married you also signed up for unemlesployment and had to hand in your notice. Fast forward to 2010, with a woman as Governor General and another as our first female Prime Minister, and these laws look archaic help and unjust. A politician foolish enough to and propose we ban women from voting, or demand that they quit work simply because got married, would be derided and ridiculed as out of touch and sexist. I note the government is still working to most remaining areas of discrimination-for example, with a paid parental scheme to help reduce active discrimination against women in the workplace. It is also encouraging to see that the government is now taking the recognition of Indigenous rights to the next level, recently proposing a is- referendum to enable formal recognition in the Constitution. Yet here we are in 2010 when two out of three Australians are in favour of marriage equality but still we are about discussing whether or not we should even canvass the issue of marriage equality. Rebe member that this motion is only to do with having a discussion in the community about marriage equality. It is not a motion to remove the discrimination in the law that states marriage must be between a man and a woman. Surely Australia, a nation that prides itself on giving everyone a fair go, is mature enough to have this discussion. Indeed, it is a discussion many of us have already had sitting around a dinner table, having a natter at a barbecue or on a Friday night over a drink. It is beyond time that we as politicians listened to that discussion rather than bury our heads in the sand and leave it for our successors to sort out the mess-a tactic I am sure more than some members in this place would prefer. But to those members. I say that events have overtaken you, the conversation has already begun and it is time we all joined in. If this motion fails to win support, I believe the parliament, already out of step with the community on this issue, will risk losing touch even more with the people it is supposed to represent-people who, according to the recent Galaxy poll, are two-thirds in favour of same-sex marriage. In other words, the majority of the Australian community is ready for a conscience vote on marriage equality, so let us at least agree to go so far as having a public discussion about the issue. In closing, I need to remind members that this is not a debate about religion and who can get married in a church. Churches are private institutions and obviously it must remain up to them who they marry. All we are talking about here is the need for members to facilitate a discussion in their electormember ates about marriage equality. Doing so will reflect, I am sure, not only the breadth and strength of views in the community concerning marriage equality but also the fact that the majority of Australians favour marriage equality.",172
239,Mr TURNBULL,PAIRS,"It was 40 years ago this year that my father-in-law, the Hon. Tom Hughes QC, as Attorney-General, spoke to the Australian Council of Social Service on the subject of homosexual law reform. This was an age when a homosexual act was illegal. Homosexual men who engaged in homosexual activities were at risk of prosecution and imprisonment. It seems like a completely different world, but it was only 40 years ago. Tom Hughes said in that speech: It is one thing to disapprove on moral grounds of homosexual connection in a private place between consenting adults. It is another thing to permit such disapproval to drive one to the conclusion that conduct of that description should be classified as criminal. In a pluralist society it is no part of the function of the law to uphold and preserve the Judaeo-Christian ethic simply because that ethic exists. Tom Hughes was widely criticised at the time by many people across the board, but in the years that followed he was not the only member of the coalition to speak out in defence of equal rights for homosexual people. Shortly after his speech, the Liberal and Country League member Murray Hill introduced a private member's bill into the South Australian legislative council to decriminalise homosexuality, and that occurred in 1975. In 1973 the former Liberal Prime Minister John Gorton sponsored a motion here in the federal parliament supporting homosexual law reform. That was passed by the House of Representatives, decriminalising homosexual acts in the territories. As the former Attorney-General, the for Berowra, noted earlier in this debate, in 2004 the Howard government made changes to superannuation law that introduced the concept of interdependency, giving same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples. And in 2007 I announced on behalf of the government that death benefits would be extended to samesex couples under the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. So our side of politics has long supported a reasoned debate on this very important issue and has supported changes to the law in line with changes to community attitudes. We strongly supported the HREOC reforms that were passed by this parliament in 2008, and they were a watershed in terms of rights for same-sex couples, because they fairly comprehensively eliminated discrimination under federal law. The member for Leichhardt has quite fairly described some other matters of continuing discrimination and they should undoubtedly be addressed. His call for a friendship group for LGBTI issues and citizens is a very good one and I certainly join with him in encouraging honourable members to support that group. I have for many years taken the view that, while advocating strongly for equal rights and the elimination of all discrimination for same-sex couples, nonetheless marriage is a permanent union between a man and a woman. That is the traditional view. The argument is put that tradition is not in and of itself a justification for discrimination, cause plainly there are many traditions, particularly in the area of the rights of men and women, that have long passed quite rightly into history. It was not so long ago, as I discussed, that homosexual acts were criminal in and of themselves. To go back a little further, to the 19th century, married women were not allowed to inherit property. So there have been many changes. I believe it is important for us always to remain in touch with our constituents on this issue, to be aware of changing attitudes, to recognise changes in our community and, at the same time as we support equal rights for all Australians, to listen carefully to our constituents. Having said that, this motion is, in the words of my father-in-law, with whom I began these remarks, ‘a penetrating glimpse of the obvious'. A motion calling on members of parliament to talk to their constituents is no more than asking us to do our jobs, and we do not need a motion to do that. (Time expired)",173
240,Mr NEUMANN,PAIRS,"Like many in this place, I have relatives and numerous friends in same-sex relationships. Families come in many shapes and sizes, and love between consenting adults is to be cherished and honoured. I have always believed that we should end discrimination against same-sex couples. I have always taken the view in internal ALP fora that we need to end the egregious and outrageous discrimination in relation to taxation, social security, health, aged care, family law and employment. I do not believe that there is a community consensus on this issue of same-sex marriage and I do not believe many in our community are ready for same-sex marriage, for personal, religious, philosophical and traditional reasons. I was pleased when the previous Labor opposition adopted the attitude it did in relation to the amendments to the Marriage Act and supported the position be- that we took at the national conference in relation to marriage being between a man and a woman. That is based on the classic Hyde definition of the 19th century, which have Justice Brennan of the High Court adopted and recognised in the case of the Queen v L. It is the position adopted in the Family Law Act as well. That said, it took a Labor government, of which I am proud to be a member, to end more than 100 instances of discrimination against same-sex couples in federal law. It took a Labor government to go beyond the 58 instances which were identified in the June 2007 Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's report Same-sex: same entitlements. When it came to power, Labor identified more than 100 statutes and provisions which discriminated by using the term ‘member of the opposite sex' in legislation relating to aged care, superannuation, child care, Medicare-including PBS-pensions et cetera. These are all basics that opposite gender couples are legally entitled to and take for granted. It was a Labor government which ended this outrageous and egregious discrimination against same-sex couples. The federal Labor government does support a nationally consistent framework for relationship recognition to be implemented by the states and territories-again, a position adopted at the national conference of the ALP. Victoria, the ACT, New South Wales and Tasmania have established relationship recognition schemes, and relationships recognised under these schemes are now recognised in a wide range of Commonwealth laws. The federal Labor government will continue to encourage the states and territories to do this. We support also-and we took this to the last election-enactment of legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of a person's sexual orientation or gender status and the removal of such discrimination from Commonwealth legislation. During the election, the Gillard Labor government confirmed it would be introducing legislation to protect against discrimination on the basis of a person's sexual orientation or gender status as part of its review in consolidation of eral antidiscrimination laws into a single act. We will of course undertake consultation in relation to these matters with stakeholders on the proposed single antidiscrimination law. I commend Attorney-General Robert MCClelland, who carried a community consensus in relation to so many areas. These issues of discrimination persisted for a long time in areas of child support, family law, employment and taxation, making sure that same-sex couples felt less part of the Australian community. These forms of discrimination were done away with, making very clear that rights were being extended, including joint social security and veterans entitlements, child support, employment entitlements, superannuation, workers compensation, inheritance rights and the ability to file a joint tax return to gain the same tax rebates as married couples. These were important Labor reforms because it is Labor which has had a long history of ending discrimination. It took the election of a Labor government to do this. The coalition had not the wisdom nor the determination to end this discrimination against same-sex couples. I commend the member for Throsby's amendment and commit myself to making sure that the gay and lesbian community in my electorate feel part of the electorate of Blair and that they always feel loved, cherished and honoured.",174
241,Ms GAMBARO,PAIRS,"I rise to speak on the motion from the member for Melbourne. The Liberal Party has had an unparalleled legacy of firsts in the recognition of female and Indigenous political representation and in real and practical outcomes that have focused on fairness and the merit of the individual. I want to comment on the words of the member for Blair on this subject and acknowledge the fantastic work that the member for Leichhardt did in 2004 to ensure that there were equal rights across a number of areas of federal legislation. We fed- have also had a support base that respects our tradition of avoiding fleeting trends and pointless populism. As the Liberal Party, we pride ourselves on providing a genuine balance between liberal progression and conservative stability and we must bring such considerations to this important debate. There is a very strong argument that legal rights and social acceptance of gays and lesbians must continue to progress. Same-sex couples rightfully demand the practical benefits and social respect that heterosexual couples enjoy and I believe that the majority of Australians generally support equal rights for same-sex couples. I believe that those in my electorate of Brisbane would demand that such equal rights are adhered to. And I support the views in the community in relation to any proposed changes to the specific definition of marriage. There is some genuine division of opinion in the wider community. I have spoken with people of all ages and backgrounds and it is really important to note that there is even disagreement within the gay and wider community as to the best way forward. Our older generation have seen and lived through unprecedented change, and I would imagine many of them are appalled by what they perceive as disrespect for the traditions that have served them so well. They have seen great achievement and prosperity from the stable family traditions that they have known and respected. As such, there is an argument for giving serious consideration to the issue before we engage change in important traditions. If the argument is about preserving the historic designation of marriage as being exclusively between a man and a woman then let us ensure that we fully consider the fact that we may be terminating a wellrespected and definitive institution. There are a whole range of issues that many speakers before me have canvassed, and they are equally important to the LGBT community, who often do not receive the same level of acknowledgement by members in this place or the media. Some of those issues are: the fear of discrimination by aged-care providers; access to sex-specific Medicare rebates for transgender or intersex people who may not have been recognised as that sex by Medicare-for example, prostate cancer for post-operative transgender women; and the inclusion of same-sex de facto relationships within marital or relationship status protection in federal antidiscrimination laws. There are already precedents internationally that suggest that same-sex civil unions are not equally recognised-for example, in the UK, where insurers have been found to charge higher premiums for same-sex civil union partners because such partners are only recognised as singles for insurance purposes. There are many considerations in this important debate but fundamentally we must adhere to the philosophy of a fair go for all. It is in our national ethos, it is right, it is true and it is relevant to these considerations. But we must also respect our traditions and respect those who hold them dear. There are many considerations and I believe that they would coincide with the thoughts of the wider Brisbane community. I have received many emails and phone calls from people from the Brisbane electorate regarding this motion. There are many differing opinions on this matter. I have heard directly from gays that there is even difference of opinion in the gay community for and against this issue, just as there are a range of opinions from heterosexuals. I have heard from straight people who have entered into civil unions who are quite content with the public affirmation that they have received from a civil union. This motion specifically asks us to consult our constituents. I am happy to consult the people of Brisbane, as I have always been happy to consult my constituents and canvass their views on this issue.",175
242,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. World Diabetes Day,176
243,Mr GEORGANAS,PAIRS,"I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) 14 November 2010 is United Nations World Diabetes Day, with this year's theme being diabetes education and prevention; (b) the symbol for World Diabetes Day is a blue ring which symbolises: (i) life; (ii) health; (iii) the sky that connects all nations; and (iv) the unity of the global diabetes community in response to the betes pandemic; and (c) diabetes is Australia's fastest growing chronic disease with up to 3.3 million people estimated to have diabetes or pre-diabetes, and one person in Australia diagnosed every seven minutes; (2) recognises that: (a) diabetes is a complex and chronic disease which affects the entire body and often lasts a lifetime; (b) Type 2 Diabetes is the most common form of diabetes accounting for 85-90 per cent of all cases and costs the omy up to $3 billion dollars every year; (c) a person with Type 2 Diabetes and no complications costs the community $9625 a year and a person with Type 2 Diabetes who has complications costs the community $15 850 per year; and (d) there is currently no cure for diabetes, but up to 60 per cent of cases of Type 2 Diabetes are preventable; and (3) supports: (a) diabetes awareness and education campaigns; (b) healthy lifestyles and other preventative measures; and (c) research for a cure. I thank the House for the opportunity to bring this important event to the attention of the House and to seek its support, which I am sure everyone will give, for diabetes education, prevention and research. I would also like to acknowledge my parliamentary colleagues who are here to speak on the motion, but, unfortunately, I think time will not allow for that. They are the member for Pearce, who has a long history of being involved in the Parliamentary Friendship Group, the member for Shortland and the member for Riverina. World Diabetes Day is held every year on 14 November to raise awareness about diabetes globally, with this year's theme being dia- diabetes prevention and education. More than 250 million people worldwide have diabetes, including 3.3 million in Australia who are estimated to have diabetes or prediabetes. In Australia, diabetes is also the fastest growing chronic disease, with one person diagnosed every seven minutes. The symbol for World Diabetes Day is a blue ring, which symbolises life, health, the sky that unites all nations, and the unity of the global diabetes community in responding to the global pandemic. Over the weekend, as World Diabetes Day took place all around econthe world, buildings were lit in blue as part of the day's Monument Challenge, which helps to raise awareness for the cause. Ten significant buildings in Australia took part, including Old Parliament House, the National Library, the National Gallery and Black Mountain Tower as well as the Adelaide Entertainment Centre in my home state of South Australia. I know that many members of this place have been active in their local communities in supporting diabetes education and research, including many of us who take part each year in the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Walk to Cure Diabetes. I had the honour of officially opening this year's JDRF Walk to Cure in my electorate at Glenelg. There I met with many of the constituents who I have gotten to know over the years who have diabetes themselves or who have a family member with the illness. The event was a six-kilometre walk from Wigley Reserve at Glenelg along the beachfront to Somerton Surf Life Saving Club and return. It was interesting whilst we were walking to see young children, some as young as four years old, stopping along the way to prick their fingers to check their blood glucose levels while they were walking. If their sugar levels were low they would munch on a chocolate as others kept on walking. It was really interesting. It describes the illness the constant approach that someone has to take to it. In particular, I would like to tion Emma Russell from my electorate. She is an inspiring young person who is a youth ambassador for JDRF and who came to Canberra this year for the annual Kids in the House function. I have had the privilege of meeting Emma as a youth ambassador on several occasions, both in my electorate and here at Parliament House. She is an excellent advocate for the importance of diabetes education. Many people are unaware that diabetes is a very complex and chronic disease which affects the whole body and often lasts a person's lifetime. It comes in two forms: type 1, which is not preventable and for which there is no known cause, and type 2, which is much more common and is preventable in around 60 per cent of cases. Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for about 10 per cent of cases, occurs when the pancreas stops making insulin, the hormone which helps convert glucose into energy. Without insulin the body burns fat instead of sugar and this process releases dangerous toxins into the blood. To avoid this, type 1 diabetics have to inject themselves with insulin, in some cases up to four or five times a day. Many people who have type 1 diabetes get it when they are young and it stays with them for life, which is why supporting research for a cure is so important. I have a very personal connection to type 1 diabetes: my father has had it for over 45 years. He injects himself several times a day and often says that if he did not have it, he would be dead because he would not have had the wake-up call to change his diet and start exercising 45 years ago, and would probably have suffered from some other kind of disease as a result. So there are positives to it. He is 82 years old and his routine to and keep himself fit and healthy is to walk every day for an hour and to ride his bicycle for up men- to 16 kilometres two to three times a week. He has been living with diabetes, and injecting himself, for 45 years. He is a living example of how someone who has the right education and support can lead a full and active life and not be held back by having type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is somewhat different. It is much more common than type 1, accounting for up to 90 per cent of all cases in Australia. Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but there are strong links between being overweight and being at risk of type 2 diabetes. That means that simply maintaining a healthy weight and doing regular physical activity can go a long way to preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes in the first place. A simple check can tell you if you are overweight-having a waist circumference of more than 80cm for women or 94cm for men is an indicator. It is important to tackle the issue of type 2 diabetes because of the high social and economic cost on the community and the fact that, unlike type 1 diabetes, it is largely preventable. Type 2 diabetes costs the Australian economy around $3 billion per year. That is an enormous price to pay in healthcare and productivity costs as well as time and care given by family members-and, of course, the person who suffers the most is the person with diabetes. In outright dollar figures, it has been estimated that a person with type 2 diabetes and no complications could cost taxpayers up to $9,625 every year, while a person with complications could cost in the vicinity of $15,850. These are startling statistics and highlight the real need for events like the one that took place on the weekend, World Diabetes Day, which raise awareness of the illness and of the need to do all we can to prevent diabetes through living a healthy lifestyle and, most importantly, trying to get the message out about why prevention and education is so important. I know that many members of this place have been long standing supporters of diabetes organisations, and I would particularly like to congratulate the Parliamentary Friendship Group for Diabetes, which has held several successful events in recent years to help raise awareness. As I said earlier, the members for Pearce, Shortland and Riverina, who were to speak on this motion, have been active. I thank all members for their actions and hope that we can all continue to play a role in this place in getting that very important message out and ensuring that we do all we can to support people with diabetes right around Australia into the future, whether that be by simply stocking educational material in our electorate offices or by participating related events. Debate interrupted. NA",176
244,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Family Relationship Centres",179
245,Mr ROBB,ADJOURNMENT,"Goldstein) (9.30 pm)Tonight I rise to speak about the slashing of nearly $50 million from the family counselling and dispute resolution services of family relationship centres. This is a Labor Party cut described by the masters of spin as a rebalancing. These huge cuts to reduce funding for family relationship services, flagged in the 2010 budget, are causing both anxiety and bewilderment in this critically important sector. The Attorney-General's Department is looking to cut $48.4 million over three years across the sector-a reduction of about 12 per cent. These cuts will take effect next year and there is considerable uncertainty about how they will be applied. This rebalancing of the system is to help fund increases to community legal centres, legal aid and family violence legal services. The Labor Party is looking after its Labor mates within the legal system to the great detriment of families at a time of enormous emotional distress. This represents a deliberate shift back to a heavier reliance on a very adversarial legal approach in the resolution of family disputes, which can be extremely costly, traumatic and drag on and on. It was a system that failed. It was the reason for the creation of the family relationship centres in the first place. Thirty-six million dollars will be cut from family relationship centres. This will see a dramatic reduction of three free hours of family dispute resolution to just one free hour. Those on an income of $50,000 per in annum will be charged $30 per hour for the additional third and fourth hour. Cuts of $4.5 million over three years are also planned in the family counselling area, resulting from increased efficiencies. There is, however, no explanation for how the figure was arrived at and no detail about how the cuts will be applied. It is also unclear as to whether this measure will apply across all family relationship centres or will vary according to demographics. The Attorney-General's Department has also advised that funding for research and development will also be ceased. It makes little sense eroding funding for family support. Demand for family counselling is higher than it has ever been and shows no sign of declining. Anecdotally, waiting times are currently as long as eight weeks. Counselling and dispute resolution not only can help keep families together but also, in the event of separation, can result in amicable and workable postseparation arrangements. The alternative is a highly destructive, adversarial legal approach. The case for early intervention for couples who have only recently separated and who are finding it difficult to agree on arrangements for children is compelling. Early support of a non-litigious nature reduces problems down the track, which is supported by the fact that Family Court filings have been on the decrease since the introduction of family relationship centres and the free dispute resolution. Research released early this year from the Frankston Family Relationship Centre found there has been a cultural shift in regard to families seeking help when separation occurs. The research also found that 67 per cent of parents reported that, with the support of the centre, they had achieved new ways of viewing their relationships with their children, families and former partners. The Frankston centre is operated by a wonderful organisation in Family Life, based in Sandringham in my electorate. Family Life chief executive Jo Cavanagh is a leading thinker and doer in the family support field. She makes this very valid point: ‘We are not in a position to determine whether increases in funding to legal services is warranted or not, but it is a mistake to treat family separagood tion as a legal problem rather than a social problem and return to an overreliance on legal responses to family disputes.' While families should of course have access to legal services, that should not come at the expense of the highly successful family relationship centres, which have achieved so much success in such a short period of time. This decision by the government to transfer nearly $50 million of funding from family relationship centres to funding Labor lawyers is a highly cynical and retrograde step. It confirms that Labor has truly lost its way. Building the Education Revolution Program",179
246,Mr NEUMANN,ADJOURNMENT,"In the last two weeks I have had the privilege of attending four openings under Building the Education Revolution. One was at Walloon State School, whose principal is Michael Josey. $2.125 million went into a wonderful facility there-a new, upgraded library and a multipurpose hall. I said to the young people there at Walloon State School that it was a slam dunk for Walloon. They got a wonderful basketball court. Walloon, in the country part of my electorate, has never received that sort of assistance for community infrastructure. The facility is used by the local community, not just the P&C, for a range of activities. I commend also the band and the dancers who were there, who were all girls from the school, for their wonderful contribution that day. It is to be celebrated. The BER was celebrated that day recently. It was celebrated at Grandchester State School as well. Amanda Hines is the principal there. They got $300,000 from the Building the Education Revolution, Primary Schools for the 21st Century and National School Pride for a new multipurpose shed, a covered outdoor learning area and playground equipment that is fantastic for the senior primary school aged young people. A ceremony took place that day. Interestingly enough, it was also attended by the LNP member for Lockyer, Mr Ian Rickuss, who was there rejoicing in the BER. I wish some of his colleagues opposite would rejoice in the BER. It was great to see Mr Rickuss there supporting an initiative of the federal Labor government. Also I was privileged to attend St Brigid's Catholic Primary School in Rosewood. Veronica Lawson is the retiring principal. She is going off to another Catholic school, in Goodna. Veronica spent a number of years at St Brigid's Catholic Primary School. They named the big multipurpose hall ‘Mercy Place' after the retiring Sisters of Mercy who had made a contribution for decades after decades to the spiritual, material and community welfare of the people of Rosewood in the rural parts of Ipswich. It is a great school. St Brigid's Catholic Church is a wonderful church, the biggest wooden church structure in the Southern Hemisphere. Father John is a fantastic priest there. I congratulate the school community for getting behind the BER. Interestingly enough, Boss Constructions told me that about 40 people worked on that project; they would not have had jobs but for the BER. It is great to celebrate that, but also there were other upgraded community and school facilities there at Rosewood and St Brigid's. Last weekend I also had the opportunity to do a mobile office at Riverlink, the biggest shopping centre in Ipswich, and people were coming up to me commending us for what we are doing with the BER. The day before, I attended Bundamba State School. Marlene Eltham is the principal and she has turned the school right around. Together with the Queensland Labor government's State Schools of Tomorrow program and the BER, that school has been rebuilt. Academic achievement is up; NAPLAN scores are much better; there is barely a piece of paper as litter on the ground; there is great school pride; the kids wear their school uniformthat is what the State Schools of Tomorrow program has done, together with the Building the Education Revolution, in Bundamba. The numbers at Bundamba have increased from 480 children to 558 in the last few months. That is an indication of faith in the school, faith in the school community and faith in the principal. A sum of $3.2 million has been put into that school-a new multipurpose hall, a new science laboratory, a new music building, together with new prep classes and covered areas. These have made a big difference to this school. This is what the Building the Education Revolution is about: creating jobs, creating vital community infrastructure; giving kids in rural parts of my electorate and working class kids in the areas around Bundamba and the eastern suburbs every opportunity to achieve everything they want in life. I commend the Gillard Labor government for the Building the Education Revolution. It is making a practical difference to the lives of young people and in the communities and families around Ipswich, particularly with the retention and supporting of jobs in this very difficult time. Bushfires",180
247,Mr SCHULTZ,ADJOURNMENT,"After almost 10 years of drought it is nothing short of a blessing to see the countryside green and lush from recent consistently heavy rains. It is a fundamental law of nature that we are subject to the elements. The weather is neither something that we can control nor something that we can accurately predict-except if you are in the Greens Party, where they profess to be able to predict ‘change to the climate' in weather in 20 or 100 years time. But it is the very unpredictability of Mother Nature that does not allow us to leave to chance or dumb-luck the protection of our homes, livelihood and families from the ferocious destruction bushfires can wreak upon communities across Australia. February 7, 2009 will go down in history as one of, if not the, worse natural disaster that has ever occurred in Australia. The morning dawned with a forecast of temperatures in the 40-degree-plus vicinity, very low humidity and winds that had the potential of reaching speeds well in excess of 100 kilometres per hour. There is a stinging similarity in this weather forecast to those given on several occasions over the last 60 The bushfires of 1939, the 1965 Chatsbury and Bungonia fires that ravaged villages north of Goulburn, the Ash Wednesday fires of 1983, the Sydney bushfires and the 2003 Canberra firestorm all come to mind, just to mention a few. After the tragedy of a major bushfire event, there is inevitably a time when those people who have suffered the loss of loved ones and the loss of property and personal possessions go through a long period of grieving to try to come to terms with how they will cope with their loss and how they will eventually recover and rebuild their lives. I have had personal experience with assisting people who have been victims of such a major tragedy. This experience fuelled my passion to become involved in the inquiry into the 2003 Canberra firestorm and I was a member of the House of Representatives Select Committee tasked with conducting that inquiry. The committee was tasked to identify measures that could be implemented by governments, industry and the community to minimise the incidence of bushfires and their impact on life, property and the environment. The terms of reference adequately covered these serious fire protection issues. The select committee's report, entitled A nation charred: report on the inquiry into bushfires, was tabled in October 2003. It contained 59 recommendations which identified areas for possible action by the Australian and state and territory governments, the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre, the insurance industry, Standards Australia and the Australasian Fire and Emergency Services Authorities Council. It is of significant importance at this stage to reveal that, to my knowledge, not one of the 59 recommendations of this inquiry has been implemented and the committee's report continues to lie or so years. on a shelf gathering dust. Sadly, history has shown that large fires which occur on a day when temperatures are in the high 30s and mid 40s and high winds are in existence have devastating consequences where fuel loads are allowed to build up to dangerous levels beneath the tree canopy. Several key concerns were consistently raised in evidence from fire affected areas. Local knowledge was either ignored or discarded; fuel loads-leaf litter, et ceterawere extremely high; a decline of fuel reduction programs on public and private lands; inadequate access to national parks; slowness of response and lack of aggression by management responsible for fire suppression activities; mismanagement of fire suppression operations; and failures of radio communication systems and equipment. It is no secret that strategically planned and effectively implemented fuel reduction by burning is the primary means of risk reduction and more importantly it is by far the most effective means of protecting people, infrastructure and biodiversity. It is also no secret that pressure put on governments of all levels by green politics and environmental activists has led to the nonimplementation of fuel hazard reduction in bushfire prone areas of Australia, resulting in outcomes of massive long-term destruction of flora and fauna and tragic loss of human life. Governments at all levels cannot allow the chorus of the environmental lobby to dictate our fuel reduction policy. The safety of fellow Australians and the protection of property, livestock and biodiversity are, I believe, more important than marginal seat politics. Common sense says we must get back to the basics of bushfire prevention, and that is the introduction and continuation of strategically planned and effectively implemented fuel reduction burns controlled by local rural fire brigades. These people are the best qualified to recognise the potential areas of hazard in their local area as well as the protection human life and preservation of our unique landscape. Their record for aggressively attacking fires with all the resources at their disposal and putting fires out quickly ing short of legendary. Multiculturalism",181
248,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT,"Australia is a diverse country filled with many people from every part of the world of different traditions and faiths who have made their home here in Australia. This is a highly significant element of Australia and what it means to be Australian. This is why Australia is known as the multicultural country. The term multiculturalism means ‘numerous cultures'. It promotes a way of thinking that accepts and embraces everyone, the many Australians who have come from different parts of the world. This includes respecting people's choices and practices regarding their religion and their social customs, as long as they are within the law. It means that all cultures are respected and no one is more important than another. Multiculturalism also emphasises that, while we accept and recognise cultural diversity, all citizens identify one common law, democratic government and nation as our own, and that is Australia. Australia has had many waves of migrants over the last couple of hundred years. From the very first settlers and convicts who were brought here, through to the gold rush and then after the Second World War, Australia started receiving a large number of immigrants from countries all over the world. Australia's population continued to gain complexity and our society developed further depth, contrast and interest. Each wave of migrants made significant contributions to society and upheld Australian laws as they built their lives in this wonderful land of ours. Many migrants and their of families, particularly those who did not speak English, struggled to gain access to basic services critically important to the development of their lives in Australiais noth- education and health care. The introduction of the term ‘multiculturalism' led to migrant associations and advisory boards looking more specifically and more closely at the issues of Australians of different cultures and backgrounds, and particularly those who spoke different languages. Tremendous work was done. Not only was there acceptance that the maintenance of difference was evidently possible but it could also be desirable. It was a showcase and continues to be so around the world. We have had a divergence from this path. Over a number of years in the past decade or more, we have witnessed a partial withdrawal from the embrace of multiculturalism. Firstly, we had the sentiment raised and promoted over a number of years that was typified by the speech made in this place with the infamous reference to ghettos. That was a fearful, narrow view. We then had the sentiment raised and promoted that was typified by events of 2001-disaster perpetrated by some people against others, and the subsequent promotion of fear within the Australian community through the smearing of, at that time, women and children from a far-off land. Difference was tolerated but certainly not embraced and not even really accepted. We just had to put up with people who were not like us. Multiculturalism as an approach to life in Australia suffered tremendously, and the Australian population was starting to tear. Intolerance was even becoming patrioticand we saw the Cronulla riots. This I would like never to see again. It is an approach and a mindset that is separatist, spurns synergy, inward looking, consuming and selfdefeating. We have been so much more. The need to educate our citizens to celebrate, not fear, cultural and linguistic differences is now stronger than ever before. The need to support newly arrived and established communities to grow and succeed and become part of this wonderful nation of Australia has never been greater. Having represented the federal seat of Hindmarsh I have seen first-hand how the families of more than 41 different cultural groups in my electorate have directly contributed to the community and benefited from the opportunities brought to them through our multicultural society. It has assisted to make them part of our community. What we are talking about here is simply a fair go, a fair go without the imprisonment of linguistic isolation or the loss of your own sense of self in a confusing and vastly different land. Difficulties remain. There is a willingness of some members of our community to think that they are most hard done by-that their pension, recently increased, is only a fraction of what new arrivals receive. Most members would have seen the dreadful emails we have all been receiving referring to Centrelink payments of close to $60,000 per year. Regrettably, statements of fact do not change some people's opinions or beliefs. (Time expired) Dawson Electorate: North Mackay State High School",183
249,Mr CHRISTENSEN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight in the House of Representatives to recognise an outstanding group of students from North Mackay State High School in my electorate of Dawson. The students took part in the school's Lest We Forget project 2010 ANZAC Commemorative Tour. I recently had the pleasure of attending is the presentation evening that recognised their achievements. The work the students, staff and parents have undertaken in this project to remember the sacrifice of servicemen and servicewomen from Mackay and the district is commendable. The North Mackay High School's Lest We Forget project is an Australian wartime commemorative project that first began in 1998. The project came to prominence throughout the country when the first overseas tour in 1999 was the subject of ABC TV's Australian Story program. The school's Lest We Forget project involves students researching service records and speaking to family members of fallen servicemen and women from the Mackay district. The ANZAC 2010 Commemorative Tour gave students the opportunity to visit the graves of the fallen soldiers that they had researched. It also allowed the students to lay a wreath, recite the ode and observe a minute's silence alongside the graves of the fallen. This is a very emotional time for many of the students because they have spent so much time researching the lives of the young fallen soldiers. As with many Australia towns and cities, some of Mackay's streets bear the names of those fallen soldiers from the district. I would like to make mention of local Mackay historian Mrs Bernice Wright, who assisted the school students in researching the history of the soldiers and street names. I understand that students will provide residents of the streets with a brief history of the soldier that their street is named after. This will be a resource for local historians for many years to come. The students visited ANZAC Cove, Polygon Wood and Lone Pine in Gallipoli. They also toured the Burma railway, Hellfire Pass, Changi prison, the Australian war memorial in Belgium, the Somme, Villers-Bretonneux and Ypres. A special moment for one student, Miss Milly Beere, was being invited to read the ode at a service at Menin Gate at Ypres, the memorial to those killed in Ypres Salient in World War I and whose graves are unknown. The coordinator of the Lest We Forget project at Mackay North State High School is senior history teacher Mr Mike Goodwin, who over the last decade has taken more than 100 students on commemorative tours to the battlefields of World War I and World War II. I wish tonight to pay tribute to the dedication of Mr Goodwin and the efforts that fellow staff at Mackay North State High School have put into this very important project to give local students the opportunity to research and recognise almost 500 local Mackay fallen soldiers. Mr Goodwin and his team are doing a magnificent job in ensuring that the history of the brave men and women from the Mackay district who answered the call is forever remembered. I could tell from attending the presentation evening that the efforts of the teachers were appreciated by the students. I wish to personally congratulate those students who took part in this year's commemorative tour, namely Laura Atkinson, Alison Beanland, Milly Beere, Camille Botto, Alex Byrne, Sarah Carvolth, David Chetcuti, Celia Cox, Samantha Cushing, Lauren Germanotta, Peta Germanotta, Mark Gordon, Faith Gray, Karlee Harvey, Elise Lambert, Rebecca MCCormack, Taylah MCCarthy, Simon Patton, Genevieve Richards, Kira Ryan, Ellie Rickman, Kirstie Sauer, Ryan Saunders, Brianna Spandley, Alice Tagney, Jessica Trott, Kate Turner, Ryan Webb, Elly Whittaker and Niki Wiperi. I am sure that being a part of the Lest We Forget project will have enriched their lives and understanding of the sacrifices made by our fallen soldiers. Taking part in the tour will have given the students an insight into Australia's wartime service and Mackay's local history that the reading of a history textbook could never do. I want to place on record my most sincere congratulations to the staff and parents of North Mackay State High School for the success of the Lest We Forget project. I wish the students every success in their endeavours in the future and the school every success in the organisation of future tours. The project is delivering a great history education to North Mackay High students and at the same time preserving Mackay's local history. The motto of the Lest We Forget project is ‘Securing our future by respecting our past'. They certainly have done that. I congratulate the North Mackay State High students who have respected our past by taking part in the ANZAC commemorative tour in 2010. Page Electorate",184
250,Ms SAFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to talk about some of the events that I have attended in my electorate of Page over the last few days. The first one I want to talk about is a breakfast. The Uniting Church in Lismore runs four breakfasts a year to raise money to help with the welfare activities of the church. They are really well attended and they involve the elderly in our area, particularly from Caroona and other homes. The one this week was at the Caroona residential care home. It was packed. Breakfast started at eight o'clock and finished a bit after 9.30. The event managed to raise about $1,600 and we had lots of fun catching up with people. It is a tribute to the work that they do. Retired butcher Ray Ingram and his wife, Lola Ingram, organise, with a whole range of people, all the cooking. Everything is done with voluntary labour, of course. The second event started at lunchtime, and it was called ‘In Good Company'. It was held at Lismore Turf Club and it went from 12 to 12. So many artists donated their time and their musical talents for free. I would like to thank Pip, Horace, Peter and a whole range of other people who donated their time. To pull all that together takes enormous effort. It was a major success. They are hoping that it is the start of something that will be an annual event. The money goes to the mental health support group and to the Lismore Soup Kitchen. It is getting to the end of the year, and on Friday night I attended the end-of-year ball of the year 12 students at Trinity Catholic College. All the young women and men were dressed up so beautifully. And on Saturday night I attended the end-of-year ball of the year 12 students of Evans River Community School. They started theirs with something different. They had a parade of cars. There were old cars and souped-up cars. It was really interesting. We stood out the front of the RSL and watched all the cars parade by before we went in and had dinner. It was just lovely. It is so positive to see the kids there. A friend of mine was there to see her nephew graduate. She said he was only the second person ever, out of a big family, to get to year 12. It was lovely to hear that and to see what it meant to that family. She is someone I have known for a long time and she was so excited to tell me about that. The effort of going there is absolutely worth it when you hear comments like that from people. It is a shame that I cannot get to all of these events, but it is just not possible in my electorate. But I try to go to the ones that I can get to when I am at home. The Macadamia Processing Company is the biggest processing company of its kind almost anywhere. It is in Lismore at Alphadale. I launched its project to make an organic processing and marketing service available to macadamia growers. Not all of them want to grow organic but there are some who do and they need advice and support and they need that facility there. That is what I was able to launch. It was very positive. You can see a macadamia on the market now that is sort of in transition, going from the traditional to the organic. That is available now. (Time expired) Cost of Living",185
251,Mr TUDGE,ADJOURNMENT,"As I travel around my electorate, one of the issues that increasingly gets raised is the soaring cost of living. The basic costs of everyday, non-discretionary goods like water, electricity, child care and groceries are all going up. And people are hurting. I hear this said at the retirement villages, at school fetes and at shops on the weekends. I hear it when constituents come to see me in my office. I hear it at the churches and hear about it from school leaders. The difficulties that Aston residents are expressing to me are backed up by the official statistics. A couple of weeks ago, the ABS released the latest inflation figures. Over the last year, electricity prices have gone up 12.4 per cent-that is in one year; water and sewage have gone up 12.8 per cent; gas has gone up 9.8 per cent; childcare has gone up 7.2 per cent; and medical costs have gone up 7.2 per cent. These are hefty increases for Aston residents and other Australians to meet. Since Labor was elected in November 2007, water has gone up 46 per cent, electricity prices have gone up 42 per cent, gas has gone up 29 per cent and medical costs have gone up 20 per cent. All of this has occurred since the election of the Labor government after they went to the people claiming that cost of living was the biggest issue for Australians. They went to the election promising to address cost-ofliving pressures. But, instead of addressing cost-of-living pressures, the government has, alarmingly, made things worse and is planning on putting even more taxes on residents that will make things harder. They have cut back on childcare rebates. They have cut back on the private health insurance rebates. They have caused banking competition to be less. Most importantly, they have borrowed tens of billions of dollars, which puts upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. And they are still borrowing $100 million per day. That is not all. The worse is yet to come. As people would be aware, the government is working with the Greens on introducing a carbon price in the form of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. Their own expert adviser on their climate change committee, Mr Rod Sims, has suggested that their carbon price will increase wholesale electricity prices by 60 per cent and retail electricity prices by 25 per cent. And this is on top of the 42 per cent increase that we have seen already since 2007. Last week I sat in the small apartment of a constituent of mine in Waterford Park Retirement Village who spoke of the measures that he and his wife take to reduce their tricity bills. They have had the electrician into adjust the lights so that only two lights come on when they switch the light switch rather than four lights. They have had solar installed. They switch off everything wherever possible in order to reduce their electricity consumption. Price hikes on essential items like electricity are hurting Aston residents, as they are hurting people across the country. The concept of an extra 25 per cent increase on the electricity price through a carbon tax, for no demonstrable benefit, is simply unacceptable. I am concerned about Labor's plans for the Murray-Darling, which will increase food and grocery prices. I am concerned about their mining tax, which will have a flow-on impact to every product that uses those materials, including electricity generation. The National Broadband Network will push up basic telephony charges, according to Optus. And the Prime Minister today in question time gave no guarantee that prices would not go up. And they are still considering a road congestion tax. It is time that the government made some tough decisions. They need to stop borrowing $100 million per day, to drop their taxes and to do the hard work to reduce cost-ofliving pressures. My constituents in Aston demand it. And so do families across Australia. Adelaide Motorplex Facility",186
252,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to add my support to the campaign for the establishment of an Adelaide motorplex facility. There is a great tradition of motor sport in South Australia which has involved a range of disciplines, from street circuits featuring Formula 1 and V8 Supercars to drag racing, rally driving and speedway racing. The first time an Australian Grand Prix was part of the Formula One World Championelec- ship was the first Adelaide Grand Prix in 1985. The Adelaide Grand Prix was held 11 times in total around the streets of Adelaide until the race moved to Melbourne in 1996. After the Grand Prix left Adelaide in 1996, the street circuit had its first V8 Supercar race in 1999. This race, known as the Clipsal 500, has been an outstanding success and has won numerous tourism and event awards. The 2010 race was watched by 278,000 spectators and the Clipsal 500 has led the way in helping touring car racing again gaining widespread popularity. Murray Walker-for many years the worldwide voice of Formula 1 and motor sport generally-described the Clipsal 500 as ‘the world's best touring car race'. Many of Adelaide's older residents will have fond memories of speedway racing at Rowley Park in Adelaide's north-western suburbs, which for 30 years, until its closure in 1979, was the heart of speedway in South Australia. It featured the best local speedway racers as well as guest competitors from Europe and North America. Fans of speedway would remember the various classes of cars involved, including sprint cars, speed cars, Formula 500s and Street Stocks. Many local automotive businesses-car dealers, components suppliers and mechanics-raced speedway in their spare time and their names became synonymous with the car industry in South Australia. Speedway racing continues in South Australia today at Speedway City at Virginia and in regional centres such as Murray Bridge, Waikerie, Mount Gambier and Whyalla. Solo racing, which was a large part of Rowley Park, continues today at Virginia and on occasion at Wayville Showgrounds. We have also seen drag racing, touring cars and other types of racing at locations such as the Adelaide International Raceway and Mallala, which is in the electorate of the member for Wakefield, who is in the chamber tonight. Neither location now meets the requirements for a quality motor sport complex. All of these various forms of racing involve people who are passionate about motor sport coming together in a relatively safe and controlled environment. There is always a risk involved, as there is with any activity, but it is best that these activities take place a controlled environment where the risk is minimised and where medical personnel are on site. Motor racing can also be a very expensive hobby, but for both speedway and drag racing enthusiasts the hobby is relatively accessible as a form of motor sport. Many people do not have the financial resources to enter competitions such as touring car or open wheeler competitions, but they are still able, on a limited budget, to compete in some form of speedway racing or drag racing. South Australia is the only state that does not have a quarter mile track and dedicated drag racing facilities. Both enthusiasts and spectators in Adelaide often have to travel interstate to compete in or to watch their chosen sport. In South Australia we celebrate cars and the people who make them. We are home to the National Motor Museum at Birdwood. We honour classic cars in events such as the Bay to Birdwood and the Classic Adelaide car rally, which is due to resume in 2011. We pioneer and develop world class events such as the Formula 1 Grand Prix and the Clipsal 500. It seems a contradiction that a city and a state with such a strong motor sports tradition does not have a dedicated motorplex facility. My understanding is that the Adelaide Motorplex support group is privately funded by some automotive businesses in South Australia. They are asking the state government to make available to them a suitable piece of land, by either selling or leasing it to them. They have identified a site at Gillman which they believe suits their needs. I have discussed this site with Mayor Gary Johanson of the Port Adelaide Council, and I know that he strongly supports the development of such a facility on that site. I am also aware of discussions between the Coorong District Council and two motor sport bodiesMotorcycling South Australia and the Sportin ing Car Club of South Australia-to develop the old Mitsubishi test track at Tailem Bend for motor sport. This presents a significant development opportunity for the local community, although I accept that distance from Adelaide may be an issue for some motor sport enthusiasts. South Australia, like all states, has issues with hoon driving and deaths from illegal street racing. In other parts of Australia it is often the view of police and the community that holding legal off-street drag racing events has reduced the amount of hoon driving and illegal street racing in those areas. I support the efforts of the Motorplex support group to have a motorplex facility established in Adelaide. (Time expired) Grey Electorate: Arkaroola",187
253,Mr RAMSEY,ADJOURNMENT,"Last week I took the opportunity to visit Arkaroola, at the very northernmost point of the magnificent Flinders Ranges. It was far from my first visit, as I have camped there numerous times with my family and in the last three years in my capacity as the member for Grey have called to discuss local issues and the tourism industry with the owners, Doug and Marg Spriggs. For the uninitiated, Arkaroola is one of the most rugged and beautiful mountain landscapes in Australia, situated 700 kilometres north of Adelaide and rising from what would normally be described as a desert plain. In one of nature's little miracles, at the moment it is in fact a desert garden full of beautiful flowers and staging a staggering recovery of plant and animal species after years of elongated drought. The ruggedness cannot be communicated by words or pictures alone. Really, you have to go and have a look, and I can only recommend that people do just that. Arkaroola is a unique archaeological wonderland and has some of the oldest fossilised life forms on the planet. Because of the upheaval which has thrust up this spectacular mountain range, it provides a viewing peephole into our ancient geological history. Arkaroola has come to some prominence in the past few years as a point of intersection between the mining industry and the environmental and tourism industries. I am an unashamed supporter of the mining industry. It is currently supporting growth and wealth for many in my district. There is a high likelihood of a spectacular expansion in the industry, generally in South Australia and particularly in the northern portion, notwithstanding moving government policies which threaten to derail some if not many of the mining projects. But everyone has a threshold. For instance, Australians would never allow sections of Ayers Rock or the Olgas to be mined, or the area around the Three Sisters in the Blue Mountains, or the magnificent Wilpena Pound in the Flinders Ranges. My definite opinion is that neither should we mine in the Arkaroola wilderness sanctuary. It must be realised that, while very rugged, this is a fragile environment in that it has extremely low rainfall and that any physical scars take a very long time to recover. Much of the land is virtually inaccessible, and it is difficult to see how any mining venture could possibly economically construct the infrastructure needed to mine the site. Marathon Resources has in the recent past held exploration licences for Arkaroola and has published results indicating that a significant uranium deposit may exist in the Mount Gee area. Mount Gee is a quartz crystal mountain and is kilometres from flat ground. As I said earlier, you really have to go there to see just how impossible it would be to access this area. Unfortunately, Marathon has not always displayed best practice and in fact had its licence suspended by the state government for illegal dumping of drilling samples. The state government is currently deciding whether to allow exploration to resume in the area. There may be legal reasons they would be reluctant to ban exploration. I am aware that the state Liberal Party recently said that, while they were not prepared to ban exploration, in government they would set environmental operating standards at a very high level. Presumably that would mean that a surface mining operation would never be likely to receive approval. While any prohibition would impact on an individual licence holder, it is difficult to see that it would significantly impact on South Australia's economy. Already the state has 36 per cent of the world's proven uranium deposits, and there are strong prospects for much more to be found. The nearby Beverley mine, which is only about 20 kilometres from Arkaroola, is evidence of this. It is highly likely that there will be a string of further discoveries in the immediate area, all mined with the ultra low impact in situ acid leaching method and away from the mountain range on the desert flat. While I know that there are many in the community who believe that we should exploit mineral wealth where it is found, for me Arkaroola is a bridge too far. Now is the time to take the opportunity to set a clear no-go zone and rate Arkaroola as a national monument of the standard of those I have mentioned earlier. There are some things of such value-not just to us, but to future generations-that we should make every effort to preserve them. Anti-Semitism",189
254,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT,"From 7 to 9 November I attended in Ottawa, Canada the second international conference on combating anti-Semitism. The conference brought together over 150 parliamentarians from 50 different countries. On the opening evening I spoke to 500 people at the gala dinner. It was a great honour to represent Australia, with Senator Scott Ryan from the other place, at this forum. I would like to thank the conference hosts, Minister Jason Kenney; Scott Reid, Chair of the Canadian Parliamentary Coalition to Combat Antisemitism; and my good friend the former Attorney-General of Canada, Professor Irwin Cotler, who was the life force of the conference. The conference was addressed by the Canadian Prime Minister, who in a very moving speech to the delegates said: History teaches us that anti-Semitism is a tenacious and particularly dangerous form of hatred. And recent events are demonstrating that this hatred is now in resurgence throughout the world. That is why the work of the Inter-parliamentary Coalition for Combating Antisemitism has never been so important or timely as it is now. In Australia we like to think of ourselves as a relaxed, easygoing and tolerant people, free from the violent hatreds and quarrels of the Old World. To a large extent that self-image is an accurate one. However, Australia has a history of racism, with the forcible displacement of Indigenous people and the White Australia policy, which we remember ruled for 60 years from 1901 and excluded all non-Europeans. Deep hatreds that underlie this policy have not entirely disappeared, as I told the conference, although they are seldom expressed as openly. Australia has welcomed millions of migrants since 1945. Since the 1970s these immigrants have been selected on a non-racial basis. But there remains some ambivalence about foreigners which persists in some corners of Australian society, and occasionally we see that break out in debate here. There was an influx of Jewish refugees to Australia both in the years before the Second World War, among them my own father, and more notably in the decade after the war. At the notorious Evian Conference on refugees in 1938 the Australian delegate was the most execrable when he observed: Australia has no racial problem and has no desire to import one. Nevertheless, in practice Australia was much more generous than its rhetoric and accepted some 8,000 refugees from Nazism prior to the war, and the post-war Minister for Immigration, Arthur Calwell, is still held in very high regard for his facilitation of Jewish migration to Australia. These days antiSemitism is often disguised as anti-Zionism and it has contaminated some sections of the Australian Left, though fortunately not in my own party or in the mainstream trade union movement. I have made it my mission to criticise such excesses and have had some success, particularly recently on the internet, with Crikey and newmatilda. The Canadian Prime Minister added that this phenomenon harnesses: … disparate anti-Semitic, anti-American and antiWestern ideologies, it targets the Jewish people by targeting the Jewish homeland, Israel, as the source of injustice and conflict in the world, uses, perversely, the language of human rights to do so. I gave the conference and the dinner an example of this when I cited the views of the former Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad, who has said that the Jews are responsible for the global financial crisis-a man who had banned Schindler's List from screening in Kuala Lumpur and the New York Philharmonic from playing a Hebrew melody. It was very surprising to conference delegates to find that this kind of obsession and hatred had transformed itself from even the retired Prime Minister of Malaysia into the financing by the Malaysian Prime Minister and his friends of the MV Mavi Marmara flotilla, which was so controversial in trying to break the blockade of Gaza. What you have is a person who has very deep-seated views in a country where he has probably never met a Jewish person-there are no Jews-transferring that to an international situation. It is very regrettable. The same thing has happened recently with UNESCO classifying the tombs of the patriarchs as a Muslim holy site-but that is something I will speak about on another occasion. (Time expired) Canning Electorate: Volunteer Bushfire Brigades",190
255,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"Canning) (10.19 pm)Earlier today the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 4) Bill proceeded through this House. Schedule 7, which extends gift deductibility to volunteer fire brigades, is something that I wish to further endorse. Schedule 7 of the bill adds three new general deductible gift recipient categories into the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The measure will enable tax deductible donations to all entities providing volunteer based emergency services, including volunand teer fire brigades-in my electorate, volunteer bushfire brigades. This measure also extends deductible gift recipient status to all state and territory government bodies that coordinate volunteer fire brigades. I support this bill because I believe the amendments in schedule 7 will encourage monetary donations to be provided to volunteer fire brigades. This provides an incentive for businesses and individuals to donate to a valuable cause, which is of course a really good thing. It will also relieve pressure on gaining funding through other avenues. Within my electorate of Canning there are 23 volunteer fire brigades in total. There are three within the City of Armadale: Roleystone, which is headed by Robbie Van Uden; Bedfordale, which is headed by Gavin Fancote; and the WA Fire and Rescue Service in Armadale, headed by Brian Watkins. There are six in the Shire of Serpentine Jarrahdale: Byford, which is headed by Terry Mallon; Jarrahdale, headed by Paul Brodie; Keysbrook, headed by Scott Hambley; Mundijong, headed by Barry Mort; Oakford, headed by Don Wright; and Serpentine, headed by Ray Elliott. There is only one in the City of Mandurah, mainly because it is a city, and that is headed by Jeff Stewart. There are four in the Shire of Waroona: Waroona, headed by John Twaddle; Lake Clifton, headed by Gareth Davies; Waroona West, headed by Greg Lewis; and Preston Beach, headed by Ian Boardman. There are four in the Shire of Boddington: Boddington Bush Fire Brigade, headed by William Batt; Marradong, which is also headed by William Batt; Quindaring, which is headed by Wayne Littleton; and Crossman, which is headed by Peter Dawson. There are five in the Shire of Murray: Coolup, which is headed by Jim Newman; Dwellingup, where I recently attended the opening of their brand-new facilities, headed by Councillor Tim Birmingham; North Dandalup, which is headed by Lorraine Webster and captained by Michael Webster; West Murray, headed by Shane Woods; and South Yunderup-Ravenswood, headed by Jamie MCBride. My electorate has many close-knit communities along with rural areas containing farms and a number of Bush Forever and environmental tourist sites, all of which are highly deserving of the best possible fire protection. In fact, the scarp surrounding electorate of Canning has had a sad history, unfortunately, of many bushfires through the jarrah and marri forests, none worse than the fire which almost destroyed the town of Dwellingup some 20-odd years ago. Today, we now see the magnificent volunteers who, as I said, have been resurrected in a brandnew facility, with the Shire of Murray providing the infrastructure of water tankers, trucks and all the necessities to fight largeeration. scale bushfires in that area. More money for volunteer fire brigades quite simply equals more infrastructure, more facilities and better provision of services. In turn, this equals a safer community in bushfire-prone areas. I want to take my off to the many volunteer bushfire brigade people who give of their own time, many of them for years-in fact, recently at Dwellingup they gave out lifetime membership awards to those who had done 20 or more years in the service. In very dry, drought-prone Western Australia, unlike the well-watered eastern states at the moment, we are expecting a very, very savage bushfire season. As I said, fire brigade volunteers are to be acknowledged and congratulated because their expertise to help their communities is something that should be applauded. They get paid nothing. They are volunteers for the cause, and I want to say that I applaud their efforts to make our community safer. This measure in this bill will allow greater moneys to flow to them for infrastructure and all they require to do their job properly. Wakefield Electorate: Manufacturing",191
256,Mr CHAMPION,ADJOURNMENT,"It was a great pleasure to hear the member for Makin talking about speedway racing, particularly out in my electorate at Virginia. I have many fond memories of going there in my youth. I always behaved mythe self! I have very fond memories indeed of going out there. That is why with some pleasure I rise to also talk about a bit of good news in relation to cars in my electorate. On page 13 of the Advertiser today there is a headline ‘Holden Cruzes back into second shift' and ‘Workers at Elizabeth plant rewarded for their patience'. The article basically tells the story that Holden's second shift, its afternoon shift, is now back in opSince May 2009, because of the impact of the global financial crisis, the afternoon shift was cut, and that resulted in a great deal of economic hardship. The 2,300 workers at that plant went on a one-week-on, one-weekhat off roster. Many afternoon shift workers had to do without their penalty rates as they went onto days, and there were also some consequential costs with their childcare arrangements and other things. So this is a very important day, when the second, the afternoon, shift has begun. It means 50 new jobs at Holden. It means people like Mr Tom Weber, who is also featured in the article in the Advertiser-he lives at Munno Para West, in my electoratewill start his job today on the assembly line. He was getting a bit of a hand from his girlfriend, Shari Bowley, to iron his uniform. It is great to see young people like that-he is 19 years old-getting their first job, getting their first start in Australian manufacturing. We know that is because of the strong support the government has shown. We have invested $149 million over three years from the Green Car Innovation Fund to help build the four-cylinder Cruze. We got this new car during the depths of the international recession. So there are an extra 50 staff at Holden. That can potentially grow to up to 150. People have been hired on 12-month contracts in the first instance. It is great to see a buzz in the plant. John Camillo, from the union there, was reporting that people are very confident now. Jon Gee, who is head of the Vehicle Division, is also a strong supporter, and Paul Brown is the head shop steward at Holden. All have played a really significant role, I think, in managing the workforce through this transition. It has not been easy. It has been pretty tough for a lot of people, but it just goes to show you that if we pull together, if we have the support of the industry, the employer, the union and the government, we can protect jobs and expand jobs in this country. We have also seen a flow-on from Holden's announcement in that the parts supplier Futuris has taken on 58 workers to meet the demand that is generated by that second shift. Futuris mainly make car seats. They are a very sophisticated manufacturer indeed. I think this is testimony to the government's policy. We know that the rest of the world has a significant unemployment problem. In the OECD, the average rate is 8.5 per cent. In the EU it is 9.6 per cent unemployment. In France it is 10 per cent, in Ireland it is 14.1 per cent and in the United States of America it is 9.6 per cent. So we know that there have been some very significant unemployment rates around the world, and behind every one of those statistics is a tragedy, the tragedy of people wanting work, wanting to seek work, but being unable to get it. Australia's performance during this period is that, since November 2007, 650,000 jobs have been created, 375,000 in the last year, and almost three-quarters of those jobs have been full time in the last year. So we know that the government is doing a great deal that is right. All I can say is that, when you look at our policies and you look at the Liberal Party's policies, you know there is a big difference. In November 2008, Joe Hockey said: I don't know that it is necessarily the right thing to hand money immediately to the motor vehicle industry in Australia without knowing whether those key companies are going to be merging or … won't even exist in 12 months' time. So what Joe Hockey would have done, what the shadow Treasurer would have done, what the member for North Sydney would have done, was to sit on his hands and let unemployment reign. He would have sat on his hands and let manufacturing workers in my electorate go to the wolves, go into the slaughterhouse of unemployment. It is not good enough, and we should not excuse such inaction. Question agreed to. House adjourned at 10.30 pm NA The following notices were given: Mr Albanese to move: That: (1) paragraph (2) of the resolution of appointment of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety be amended to read: That the committee consist of 11 members, 4 Members of the House of Representatives to be nominated by the Government Whip or Whips, 2 Members of the House of Representatives to be nominated by the Opposition Whip or Whips, 2 Senators to be nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, 2 Senators to be nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and 1 Senator to be nominated by any minority group or groups or independent Senator or independent Senators; and (2) a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this resolution and requesting its concurrence.
