Taxation: Volunteer Firemen To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House very of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned Volunteer Firemen attached to the New South Wales Fire Brigade Service respectfully showeth: That the Volunteer Firemen of the New South Wales Fire Brigades are performing an essentia] community service in suburban and country towns by providing low cost hie protecdon and in sacrificing their form this essential service, are being subjected to severe financial loss by having to pay income tax on two incomes which under the present taxation system discourages most individuals from having two jobs. That the present situation has resulted in the resignation of a large number of volunteer firemen because of the taxauon, leaving a number of fire brigades under strength and a reluctance of potential recruits to pay excessive taxation. That this growing problem could be effectively dealt by granting taxation concessions to volunteer firemen in State of New South Wales similar to those being members of the Citizens Military Forces. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will urge the Government to review the Taxation Act to exempt the earnings of volunteer the State of New South Wales from income tax, or give consideration to separate assessment of earnings and so protect the future of the volunteer fire service in New South Wales. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Cohen, Mr Morris and Mr Sullivan. Petitions received. Private Nursing Homes: Pensioner Patients To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The petition signed citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many pensioners who are holders of the Pensioners Health Benefit Card, have suffered undue hardship as inmates of Private Nursing Homes, because the Federal Government Subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges laid down. Many pensioners whose spouse vate Nursing Homes suffered poverty in an endeavour tain their partner while in the nursing home. Only in rare cases was the statutory tribution as laid down adhered to. That the telephone was a matter of life and death to many pensioners, but because of the cost of installaton of the telephone many are unable to afford the installation. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very litde else to live on and are forced to pay high rents, are in many cases living in extreme poverty. The foregoing facts impel your petitioners to ask the AusGovernment as a matter of urgency to: 1. Make sure that subsidies paid to Private Nursing Homes are such that each pensioner holding a Pensioners Health Benefit Card will pay the Private Nursing Home no more than the statutory minimum patient contribution, which will PETITIONS allow six dollars per week to beretainedby the pensioner for patient for their personal use. 2. That a pensioner holding a Pensioner Health Benefit Card shall have a telephone installed free of charge, or at a very nominal charge. 3. That those pensioners who have only their pension and little else to live on, shall receive a subsidy to assist them. The subsidy to be governed by a Means Test. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hunt and Mr Morris. Petitions received. Broadcasting and Television Programs leisure and rest hours to perTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That because television and radio effects of (a) affect our social and moral environment, (b) are family media watched and heard by many children at all times, and (c) present too much explicit violence and sex, with they therefore need stronger control than other media and the the existing standards need stricter enforcement in both received by national ABC, and commercial sectors. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Australian Government will amend the Broadcasting and Television Act, inrelationto both national and firemen in commercial broadcasters, to legislate (a) for adequate and comprehensive programs in the best interests of the general public, (b) for a 'Dual System of Regulation' enforced by the Australian Broadcasting Tnbunal by internal regulation and external control. (c) for an independent consumer body to represent the best interests of the general public, and (d) for immediate and effective penalties to be imposed for breaches of program and advertising standards.

Medical Benefits: Abortions To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the as House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully was an inmate of the Prishoweth: to susThat the weakest member of our society, the unborn, should have the same protection as all other citizens of minimum patient conAustralia. That abortion is a denial of the civil rights of the unborn, involving as it does the destruction of innocent human life. That on 10 May 1973 the House of Representatives rejected the Medical Practices Clarification Bill which sought to legalise abortion on demand in the Territories controlled by the Federal Government. That women and girls with serious problems during pregnancy need special care and help to overcome their difficulties rather than encouragement to terminate their pregnancies. That termination of pregnancy can never be justified on sociological or personal grounds and can be a dangerous treatment when the motherrealisesthat her child has been killed. That over 46,000 abortions were paid for in 1976 under the existing Medical Benefits Schedule which stipulates the benefit payable for Medical Services under both Medibank and the Pnvate Health Insurance Funds. That approximately $5m was spent on abortions in 1976 under Item No. 6469-'The evacuation of the contents of a gravid (pregnant) uterus by curettage and suction curettage'. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government takes action 1. To assist financially those pregnancy help services which provide help and suppon to both mothers and their unborn children; 2. To stop the funding and specialising in elective abortions; 3. To stop payment of abortion claims under Item 6469 of the Medical Benefits Schedule. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hodges. Petition received. Medical Benefits: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens showeth: That abortion has become a multi-million dollar business in Australia in spite of the fact that the Medical Practice Clarification Bill in 1973 was overwhelmingly defeated. The multi-national giant, Population Services national which operates in Sydney, is now expanding its business to include Canberra. In 1976 alone, over 46,000 abortions were being paid for under the existing Medical Benefits Schedule which stipunuclear lates the benefit payable for Medical Services under both Medibank and the Private Health Insurance Funds. Item 6469-'The evacuation of the contents of a gravid uterus by curettage and suction curettage' now attracts a physicists benefit of $65.00. In 1976, close to $5m unborn children. Under the 'abonion item' No. 6469, abortion-on-demand ment is now being paid for from public monies, the existing Health Funds. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government takes action: 1. to stop payments of abonion claims under Item No. 6469 of the Medical Benefits Schedule the abortion has been carried certified medical procedure of preventing the death of the mother. 2. to stop the funding and operation of any so-called nancy help service or health centre which offers abortion-onhumble demand. 3. to financially assist those pregnancy help services which provide genuine support to both mothers and their unborn children.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Lucock and Mr Lusher. Petitions received. Uranium operation of services or clinics To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the undersigned persons believe: That there should be no mining or exporting of uranium in the next five years, while alternatives to, and consequences of such mining and export are considered and fully debated.

We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this Interhumble petitionrespectfullyshoweth: That we"" believe that none of the safety problems associated with uranium and plutonium has been solved. The mining and export of uranium will help to expand the power industry thus contributing to the health hazards of the world. Mining uranium will damage the environment and the health of the Aboriginal people. Our beliefs on this matter are shared by a majority of and scientists including 75 per cent of all specialists were spent to destroy in nuclear medicine. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Governwill not allow the mining, selling and export of i.e. contribution to uranium ore.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Charles Jones. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Respresentatives in Parliament assembled. The humble peddon of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Our concern at the dangerously low world whale populations. That Australia is one of the few countries still actively engaged in whaling, particularly concerns and disappoints us. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you take action to end Australia's participation in the needless slaughtering of whales by calling a halt to commercial whaling in Australia and by observing the 10 year moratorium called for by the United Nations. And your peddoners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Charles Jones. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, the peddon of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the freeze in expenditure on schools, universities and colleges of higher educauon of education in Australia; more specifically in our state of New South Wales and the region of the Lower Blue Mountains. This step has caused the shelving of many building and maintenance programmes in schools; inadequate equiping of schools; and a pool of unemployed teachers who could be used to reduce class sizes in our schools. Your peddoners call on the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to restore educauon funding to the level advocated in the 1975 Schools Commission report. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Klugman. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens showeth: That the existence of a system of double taxadon of performs sonal incomes whereby both the Australian Government tiary and State Governments had the power income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any year would(a) be faced with complicated variations in his personal income taxes between States; and (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same job would lead vary from State to State even advertised as being the same; and (c)requirecitizens to maintain records ofincome earned in each State. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that a system of income tax on personal incomes be not introduced. welAnd your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Morris. Petition received. Education To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House Whaling of Respresentatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Sydney respectfully showeth: That the financial guidelines given to the Australian Schools Commission have destroyed the independent nature of that Statutory Body and will, in the future, effectively prevent them from makingrecommendations to this and future governments on the basis of the educational needs of chUdren. That these same guidelines represent improvements to private schools, particularly those categorised as Level 1 and Level 2, which are to be financed at the expense of the government school system. That the abandonment of cost supplementation to cover inflation in the buildings program and in the non-salary area of the recurrent program, wiil seriously undermine the future building programs of all state governments and must mean a drastic curtailment in the programs to up-date schools to acceptable standards in terms of accommodation and sanitary conditions. That equality of opportunity has long been an important Education social goal in Austraha and this could be defined as equal access to schools of equal standards. The guidelines impede any progress towards this goal. Only by pursuing the targets laid down by the Interim Committee of the Australian Schools Commission in 1973 will this important social and educational goal be reached. will severely hinder the progress That the House of Respresentatives in the Parliament assembled need tore-examinethe principles on which federal funding for education are based and restore to the Australian Schools Commission itsrightto, under Secdon 13 (2) of the Schools Commission Act 1973,reportto the Minister on the needs of '. . . schools in respect of buildings, equipment, staff and other facilities and the respective priorities to be given to the satisfying of those various needs . . .' And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Ruddock. Petition received. Education Taxation To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens (students, parents, teachers) of Australia respectfully of Australia respectfully showeth: That the decision by the Government to withdraw all of financial assistance to students of Non-state TerInstitutions is in total conflict with stated Government to vary personal education policy. The decision will result in a shortage of places for training secretarial and clerical students and an inordinate demand or her upon the State Government education systems. At a time of severe economic disruption, this action must when gross wages were ation,toparticularly a serious worsening of the current employment situschool leavers. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Federal Government will act immediately toreverseits decision. And your peddoners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Viner. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Respresentatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned showeth: That on 13 September 1977, Steve Biko, President of the Black Peoples Convention, died, aged 30, while being held incommunicado for questioning in detention without trial in South Africa; That this is the 20th death of a black political prisoner in similar circumstances in South Africa in the last 18 months; and the 44th death of a prisoner while in police custody cent years; That Steve Biko had been held in detention since August 22; and had previously been held for 101 days without trial; and in addition, was under a Ave year house arrest and restriction order; That Steve Biko is the acknowledged leader of the black people's resistance to apartheid, racial exploitation and injustice in South Africa, and the hands of the white police must be regarded with grave suspicion; Your petitioners accordingly request the Australian Government toregisterthe strongest protest to the South African Government at the circumstances of Biko's death and decline to accept the credentials of the new South African ambassador due to be appointed shortly. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Antony Whitlam. Petition received. NA NA",14
3,Mr HAYDEN,OECD REVIEW OF AUSTRALIA,"I ask the Treasurer: Is it a fact that discussions have been undertaken by or for the Government with the Organisation for Econsumer omic Co-operation and Development in attempt to postpone to mid-1978 the pubUcation of the OECD review of Austraha which is due for publication in December 1977? Is it a fact that these discussions were undertaken on the initiation tive of the Australian Government? Is it a fact that an arrangement is under way, perhaps even concluded, for a swap with New Zealand in respect of the pubUcation of this review so that the New Zealand review is published in December rather than later? Is it a fact that this effort to suppress, at least temporarily, the pubUtunity cation of this report has been undertaken bethem cause, on early indications, it will be embarrassGovernment, ing to the Government, especially on matters Uke inflation, economic activity and the level of unemployment that might be expected in the near future?",17
4,Mr LYNCH,OECD REVIEW OF AUSTRALIA,"I can understand why the Mr Steve Biko honourable gentleman should seek to put a proposition of this kind. At the outset I want to deny the thrust of what the honourable gentleman citizens of Australia respectfully said. The honourable gentleman, as a former Treasurer, knows full well that the OECD makes a regular study of Australia. In due course that study becomes a pubhc document. It is different from the study undertaken by the International Monetary Fund. I recall this matter being brought to my attention about two months ago in re- or thereabouts. Certain recommendations were put to me at the time by the Treasury. It was a matter of scheduling the OECD visit to Austraha in conjunction with its commitments in other parts of the world and the scheduling of the mtended visit of the International Monetary Fund. that in this context his death in I can assure the honourable gentleman that this Government, unlike his Administration, has nothing whatsoever to fear from any objective study of the nature of the Austrahan economy at the present time. All such a study would do would be to reveal, in very stark measure indeed, the simple fact- a fact unknown to the honourable gentleman-that this Government's economic poUcies are working well and are a consequence of our adherence to a consistent economic program since we were elected to office in late 1975. I would have thought that the honourable gentleman as a former Treasurer, in a spirit of supporting Australia and not knocking Australia, might be the first to say to this Administration: Full marks for what you have done. Notwithstanding the distortions which he has sought to create in relation to Australia's mflation program, inflation is very significantly on the way down. The 2 per cent nse in the conprice index recently was a major breakan through in the fight against inflation. The Australian community knows that this Government is winning that fight against inflaand I look forward very optimisUcaUy, as do my colleagues on this side of the House, to the continumg results which willflowfrom a further sustainable winding-down of inflationary pressures during the course of this financial year. Without wanting to putfigureson the table at this time, Mr Speaker, because I want the opporfor further examination and discussion of by the Treasury and other advisers to the' I would say that the forecast on mflation, as set out hi Statement No. 2, which I hope the honourable gentleman will take the opportunity of reading, is very significantly a conservative one. So far as objective studies are cerned, the facts are there and confidence is there. The honourable member who is now interjecting is the second economic spokesman for the Opposition. I am not sure whether it is Bib or Bub who is speaking as this Question Time proceeds but I reject the thrust of what the honourable gentleman has said. This Government welcomes any objective study of the Austrahan economy because it will support greatly the thrust of all that we are doing. INTEREST RATES: EFFECT ON SMALL cent NA",17
5,Mr SIMON,BUSINESSES,"Is the Treasurer aware that business many businesses, in particular small businesses, find that high interest rates are a major burden on their cost structure? When will the GovernGovernment's ment be in a position to relieve this burden?",18
6,Mr LYNCH,BUSINESSES,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for providing me with a very useful follow-on to the question posed by the honourable member for Oxley. It is true that small busitary to the question ness in particular has been very much inhibited member for MCMillan, in recent years by high interest rates. I have no Treasurer. doubt-and other members of the Government have no doubt-that the indications now are belodged by brokers for the purchase of of coming more and more conclusive that the economic strategy upon which we embarked nearly wealth two years ago is working significantly that burden. The Government's pohcies have the economy with Uquidity istoattempting been and will continue to be very strongly rected towards controlling and reducing Treasurer Australia's inflation rate. In the only way in which we can obtain a sustain180-day treasurybUls able reduction in interest rates. I mentioned prethe three-quarter per viously that the 2 per centfigurewas a major the normal one-quarter breakthrough. May I be excused for repeating spread? I ask the Treasurer that in response to the honourable member MCMillan? More and more people in the finanto treasury notes is anticipated in of the cial markets and in the community",18
7,Mr HAYDEN,BUSINESSES,What about the 2.2 per cent,18
8,Mr LYNCH,BUSINESSES,"The shrill parrot from the Opposition cannot contain himself yet again. More and more people, both in thefinancialmarkets and in the community at large, know that inflain tion is being beaten. There is no doubt whatsointerest ever about that. After consultation between monetary authorities and the Government, let me say this: The authorities, through careful management, have reduced the yields on in Government bonds and Treasury Notes in recent weeks. As a matter of fact and information to House, as at the latest market report which I not received from the Reserve Bank of Australia, covering trading in the markets to noon today, the selling yield on long term government con- bonds-that is the October 1996 bonds-is now 9.98 per cent. In other words, it has broken through the 10 per cent barrier. It is thefirsttime in more than two years that that has been accomplished in the markets. I go on to say-put ting the position in relation to both short term and long term bonds-that it is thefirsttime in more than four years that the whole structure of government securities has been subject to such reductions. Let me conclude by saying, in summary, that the low consumer price index figure and the change of structure of interest rates in redays and weeks should be a major encouragement to the business community, and small in particular, and much to the chagrin of so many honourable gentlemen on the other side of this House it is a further reflection that this policies are working and working well. NA",18
9,Mr UREN,INTEREST RATES,"My question, which is supplemenasked by the honourable is directed to the It is a fact that the Reserve Bank of Austraha is meeting only one-fifth orders Commononly a bonds? Does this action and the fact that conversion loan is to be offered in October to relieve mean that the Government force a to flood cosmetic direduction in interest rates? Further, is the aware that the rate of interest on the longer run that is 180-day bank is 9.65 per cent, that on notes it is 8.84 per cent and that cent spread is greater than to one-half per cent In view of the unatfor tractive interest rates, what level subscription next three months?",18
10,Mr LYNCH,INTEREST RATES,"This is very tired old stuff from a rather tired old Deputy Leader of the Opposition. On other occasions he has sought to raise a quite irresponsible fashion the question of rates. Iregretthat he now seeks in this the House some estimate from me of the level of treasury note sales during the next three months. He knows that these are sensitive matters which, terms of this Government's effective control of monetary policy, require constant monitoring. I the simply observe, if the honourable gentleman has caught up with the facts of life, that last night treasury notes were shaved. Obviously the return on them will be the subject of continuing toring during the period ahead. The honourable gentleman should know, and I repeat, that interest rates are not the subject of speculation Treasurers or senior members of this Adminisregrettable tration in this House or outside in the precise terms in which the honourable gentleman seeks response from me to his question.",18
11,Mr UREN,INTEREST RATES,What about the earlier reply?,19
12,Mr LYNCH,INTEREST RATES,"As I recall it, the earher reply was in response to part of the asinine nonsense the honourable gentleman seeks to perpetrate in this House. Let me simply mention why there should not be a cash loan. I would have that the reason would have been clear to the honourable gentleman. We decided not to E ose a cash loan to the Loan Council with the >wing considerations in mind: The very satisfaction toryflowof funds from the Commonwealth's well account from the July loan-th efigurewas $610m; the net take up to date of securities the non-bank sector of $670m in the three months to the end of September; and the ported reducedfinancingrequirement of the Commona wealth in 1977-78. I think I have covered the treasury note point. May Ifinallymention to the honourable gentleman that one of the important objectives of monetary pohcy, of course, remains the vision of adequate capacity to the private sector to underwrite economic recovery, but not at same time as accommodating inflation? If there is one thing this Government has done, I believe, it has made a very significant towards the reduction of inflation because of its effective monetary pohcies. When I think of the 20 per cent M3figurewhich was running when we inherited government towards the end of 1975, and when I think also of the fact that year the guidelines, subject to the events as may work out during the year, are 8 per cent to 10 per cent, I think this Government has a record of which it can be proud in getting the money supply under control. If the honourable gentlealready man looks back to his own history, I think he see he has a lot to apologise to the Australian people for. NA",19
13,Mr GILLARD,MAIL SERVICES,"Is the Minister for Post and Telecommunications aware of continued in the delivery of mail within New South Wales? Is the Minister also aware that mail being messenger is not being received for periods to five days, when the normal delivery period for such special deliveries has been one day? What action can the Minister take in this matter? moni Mr ERIC ROBINSON-One of the real problems we have with postal services is the abihty to provide the sort of service that is desired and by required within New South Wales. Overall it is in Austraha that in New South Wales, particularly in Redfern, there is a cona stant disruption which affects the maU service not only within New South Wales but also, because of the size of the Redfern Mail Exchange, throughout Australia. The instance that the honourable member for Macquarie has given the House will indicate the seriousness of the disruption that has been caused by the intolerable attitude of members of the Austrahan Postal and thought Telecommunications Union to the Redfern MaU Exchange. We have had this constant disproruption now over a number of years. Former folPostmasters-General in the previous administraas well as administration before that will be aware of the unco-operative-to use the kindest word-attitud e of employees at the Redfern by MaU Exchange. It is a decision of the Australian Postal Commission, which is completely supby the Government, that we will not have continuation of this inabUity to give adequate service. The Commission has decided to decentralise the distribution of maU within New South Wales. That will have the effect of improving it not only in that State but also throughout proAustraha. The Commission is determined upon this course and it would have every encouragethe ment from the Government to see that mail services in New South Wales are restored to a satisfactory situation within that State and contribution throughout Australia. NA NA",19
14,Dr KLUGMAN,PREMIUMS,"My question is directed to this the Minister for Health. How many applications they have been received from private health funds, including Medibank Private, to raise their medical and hospital insurance premiums in the near future? Is it a fact that some private funds have apphed for increases in their medical or will hospital premiums to apply from 1 November? WUl any such requests be agreed to by the Minister? If not, is this part of the Government's policy to maintain artificially low health insurance premiums until after the December elections in an attempt to hide the real costs of private health delays insurance from the pubhc? sent by Mr HUNT-That is the sort of sneaky quesof up tion one would expect from the Opposition. Perhaps that is the sort of motive that would be in its mind if it were facing an election. My Department has received a number of applications from health funds in the various States. I have not yet received a formal response from the departmental registration committee recommending the fee increases that would be required. Some time ago I had discussions with Mr Moon, the Chairman of the Voluntary Health Insurance Association, who indicated that most of the funds would be thinking in terms of increasing their premiums as from 1 February next year.",19
15,Mr HURFORD,PREMIUMS,Doublin g them?,20
16,Mr HUNT,PREMIUMS,"No , not doubling them. The increase will vary from State to State. We are finding that in New South Wales, for instance, the services provided to patients by doctors has been far in excess of the services provided in other States. So one would expect the premiums to rise more substantially in New South Wales than in any other State. I would not expect there to be much variation in the premiums in South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania and indeed Queensland. I will be considering the recommendations from the departmental registration committee when they come to me for consideration and not before. NA",20
17,Mr CADMAN,INDUSTRIAL LEGISLATION,"I address a question to the Prime Minister. In view of Press comment, can the Prime Minister say whether it is the Government's intention to withdraw the industrial legislation which was passed through Parliament last week?",20
18,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INDUSTRIAL LEGISLATION,"By no means, Mr Speaker. That legislation was passed through Parliament last week. It went through speedily in case it was going to be necessary in the face of a devastating dispute in Victoria. But at the same time it was legislation that my colleague had been examining and which had been before the Government over a very long period. In relation to the three areas-the rights of individual trade unionists, the authority and reach of the Industrial Relations Bureau and demarcation disputes in particular-the changes enormously strengthen industrial law. I believe that in recent times it has been demonstrated very clearly that industrial law does need strengthening. My colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has pointed out on a number of occasions that there is a growing tactic of using a few people in isolated cases, but in cases of importance, to disrupt very large sections of the Australian community. Of course in the Victorian dispute, about 2,000 people have caused immeasurable harm to a great many families. I think they themselves have lost $2,000 and obviously their own family finances will be very much behind as a result. The whole strike was a sad and tragic affair and I am very glad indeed that those directly involved have now decided that power must be returned to Victorian homes and factories so that there can be a beginning of the repairing of the damage. The damage was great and the number of unemployed will be significantly increased. I beheve that many of them will not get their jobs back for a significant period because of the liquidity problems many businesses will face as a result. So, while 2,000 people have been striking, some tens of thousands of people are likely to be out of work for a much longer period as a direct result of that. In the face of that kind of situation, for anyone, whether it be Mr Hawke or anyone else, to suggest that that legislation would be withdrawn is an oddity indeed. If he believes it would be withdrawn he certainly does not know this Government. NA (EMPLOYMENT PROVISIONS) ACT Mr E. G. Whitlam-My question, which is directed to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, concerns the Act covering Commonwealth employees which was put through all stages in this House on 18 August and through all stages in the Senate on 19 August and received royal assent also on 19 August. I ask the Minister why, more than two months later, this Act has not yet been proclaimed?",20
19,Mr STREET,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"At the time this piece of legislation was introduced and passed the Government said that it would be proclaimed when circumstances so warranted; or words very similar to that. It is very severe legislation, designed to cope with situations in which people who are paid by the public-by the taxpayers-to provide a service to the public no longer provide it or provide perhaps only a portion of it.",20
20,Mr SCHOLES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,So that Ministers can sack people who disagree with them? Bjelke-Petersen legislauon.,20
21,Mr STREET,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I am interested to hear the honourable member for Corio interject about the capacity to sack people. Of course, that capacity has been and remains with private enterprise at all times. I believe that there is an even greater obligation on a government to take the responsibility to see that those people who are paid by the taxpayers provide a service to the taxpayers. As I have said, the Government regards this legislation as conferring a power which is required by governments and necessary for them to have. It will be used with discretion when circumstances warrant it. JAPANESE-AUSTRALIAN RELATIONS",20
22,Mr SHIPTON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I ask the Prime Minister a cussions question concerning Japanese-Australian relatime. tions and the proposed 200-mile economic zone. Is the Prime Minister aware of the New Zealand Prime Minister's threat to Japan that Japanese fishing vessels might be banned from the fruit proposed New Zealand 200-mile economic pointed zone? In view of the fact that South Pacific counthere tries are moving together to estabhsh simulthis taneously 200-milefishingzones, has Australia been informed officially of the New Zealand position? Have other countries in the South Pacific also been informed? Does the New Zealand statement threaten the date of declaraltered, ation offishingzones in the South Pacific? Does Austraha share the New Zealand Prime Minising ter's views?",21
23,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES,"I do not think we that it would be proper for me to speak in relathe tion to New Zealand's views or in relation to the precise thrust of New Zealand pohcy objectives which that countiy is seeking to means. I had heard some time ago that action of that kind might be taken by New Zealand because of its concern over marketing access to Japan. Obviously I do not know in any specific detail what has happened in relation to the Japanese and New Zealand negotiations and I would not want to comment on them. I would his hope that Austraha would not be in the position of having to use a tactic of that kind. I believe that it is better not to have to use such a tactic I hope very much that Japan, as a major trading partner of Austraha, will be able to see the intrinthe sic merit of certain propositions that have been put to her over recent times. It was put forcibly and quite directly to the Japanese Prime Minister when I was in Kuala Lumpur, and in more recent times by a group of officials and also in spondence from me, that some aspects of the trading relationship between Japan and in Australia are unequal. For example, beef ducing is a long term business and producers cannot have a breeding programranningat six-monthly intervals. Clearly, they need long term market access. It is not reasonable for them to have to argue every six months for therightof access to the Japanese market. It is reasonable know whether they can export 80,000 tonnes, put 90,000 tonnes or something better than There needs to be stability and also a growth factor in that market. The original group of officials, as I think everyone knows, did not make a great deal of progress. I then wrote to the Japanese Prime Minister and he replied that he would willingly accede to further official discussions and also disat a ministerial level at the appropriate I hope that acceptance of the Australian point of view, which is based in fairness and plain logic, on what a reasonable and proper trading relationship should be about will bear in relation to that particular matter. I have out on other occasions that, although are quotas on cars coming into this country, Government does not suggest that there should be six-monthly quotas. People have a right of access and they know that that will not be altered arbitrarily in the way in which our access to the Japanese market for beef was for example, in 1974 when the previous year's quota of 120,000 tonnes was cut to nothin the course of a year. These things need to be understood. The force of the Australian case is, I think, now understood in Japan. Obviously will have to wait and see what comes out of negotiations between officials and, if necessaiy, between Ministers. This is a matter that the Government will continue to press with all the achieve by these force at its command. NA Mr E. G.

Similar proposals relating to Civic were contained in the report on the 64th series and the Committee recommended their implementation. The introduction of boom-gate parking is, in the Committee's view, an appropriate innovation in Canberra at present. The new system is intended to ensure that parking costs are distributed more equitably between those wishing to park all day and those making short visits for the purpose of shopping or other business. It will also mean that parking can be controlled more effectively and that parking charges are paid. The Committee recommends implementation of the proposal. However, the Committee is firmly of the view that the pubhc should not be inconvenienced by construction work being undertaken during the Christmas period and that work should not begin before 1 January 1978. It is noted that the project is planned for completion by March 1978. The total cost with associated works is estimated to be $850,000. I commend the report to the House. of the PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETIES Discussion of Matter of Public Importance will be Mr SPEAKER-I have received a letter from the honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) proposing that a definite matter of pubhc importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to safeguard deposits with perbuilding societies and to encourage loans by them. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. Act More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (4.23)-Neglect by this Government and incompetence by the Queensland I Government are undermining the confidence of hundreds of thousands of Australians in permanent building societies. Those who lend are insecure; those who want to build cannot borrow. Inactivity by this Government is preventing building societies fulfilling their real function to statehelp Austrahans build their own homes. Under the Financial Corporations Act 1974, the Labor Government made it possible for the Federal Parliament to obtain the same information and exercise the same surveillance in the ofcase of building societies and hire purchase comThe panies and otherfinancialinstitutions as it has been possible to do, since the war, in the case of banks. This Government has never proclaimed Part IV of that Act. At best, the Government has tried-afte r the event, after each crisis-to guarantee the security of depositors. It has done nothing to to secure the position of borrowers. It has concerned itself-in the manner of locking the stable door after the horse has bolted-wit h deposits, but never with advances. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) had the consent of the House to incorporate in Hansard a statement he made after the last crisis involving a permanent building society in Queensland. He twice mentioned depositors; he never mentioned borrowers. What is the use of a building society which cannot build? During the last two years the housing finance industry has gone from crisis to crisis as a direct result of this Government's policies. Monetary policy has been severely misjudged. For example, the Australian savings bonds were introduced with too high an interest rate. People thereupon withdrew funds from permanent building societies to buy the new bonds, thus sharply reducing the hquid assets of the societies and forcing them to curtail their lending. I give another example: The excessively tight monetary policy at the beginning of this year caused a reduction in lending for construction or purchase of housing. Like much other Government pohcy, this credit squeeze was justified on doctrinaire grounds- a naive and ignorant attempt to apply Friedmanite doctrines in Australia; a doctrine designed to entrench privilege and to extend inequalities in our countiy. The speed with which the money supply was reduced was far faster than even Friedman himself would ever have proposed. The effect was to reduce the level of real output and so to increase unemployment. The effect on the building industry was sharply to reduce approvals for new housing. This August, they were 10 per cent below the same month in the previous year. The instability created by these pohcies affected the building societies with special severity. The crisis has been particularly pronounced in Queensland. In that State, the deep instabihty of an unstable Premier and warring coalition has compounded the problem. In October and November 1975 permanent event building societies in Queensland were approving new housing loans at the rate of 1,800 a month. By June 1976, only 84 new loans were approved in the month, and though lending has recovered, it remains far below the level at the end of The tragedy of this situation is clear when called that the permanent building societies the major lenders for house purchase in line Queensland. In the last three months of 1975,48 per cent of all loans for housing in Queensland came from building societies. During 1976, the proportion of loans from building societies in Queensland fell to 23 per cent-less than half. Queensland Government regulation and supervision of building societies has been totally inadequate. The crisis was begun by the inept launching of the Austrahan savings bonds at the beginning of last year. But this simply exposed the ineptness of the Bjelke-Petersen Government's policies and the poor management of a few of the societies. The effect of Government policy was to encourage some of the societies to maintain reserves of hquid assets which were dangerously low; consequently, when withdrawals accelerated as a result of this Federal Government's Australian savings bond issue, a few societies quickly got into trouble. Further, State Government supervision was so inadequate that even basic accounting practices were not applied. The Federal Government should have responded to this situation by taking steps immediately to increase the security of building societies and the community's confidence in the societies. Although building societies are registered under State legislation they are, in fact, a national industry. Lack of confidence in one State creates unease in all other States. Lack of confidence in the national Government's will to back the societies in one State undermines confidence in all other societies and in all other States. The lethargy and neglect of this Government have allowed an unstable situation to persist and deepen. The problems resulting from the 1976 crisis have continued. Some societies had to borrow at high interest rates to maintain their liquidity. When there is doubt about the capacity of a financial institution to meet its obligations, cautious savers withdraw their deposits. So the run has started on the Queensland Permanent Building Society a month ago and, apparently, about $18m was withdrawn. Eventually, the Queensland Permanent had to close its doors, a leaving its 140,000 members without access to their $ 165m of savings. Insecurity created by this led, fairly quickly, to a run on the MetropoUtan Permanent. This forced the Federal Government to step in, with the Treasurer, the Acting Treasurer and the Governor of the Reserve Bank making statements. The Governor 1975. said that the Commonwealth Trading Bank was, it is rewith the support of the Reserve Bank of were Austraha, making avaUable a very substantial of credit to the society which would enable it to fully match demands for withdrawal of depositors' funds. This is a hasty response to a Queensland crisis. It does nothing to secure industry. There have been small runs on building societies in many parts of the country in recent years. Thefierceyet farcical battle between leading trading members of the Liberal Party for control of the tion to preserving NSW Permanent Building Society shows the importance which some members of the conThe servative establishment place on these powerful financial institutions. Immense prestige comes from being the director of a permanent building society. Such a society will give one a personal loan of $100,000. If one is a State President or former federal President of the Liberal Party, is all so easy. Yet the Liberal-National Country Party Government has done nothing to equate strengthen or regulate the structure within which building societies operate in order to prevent kinds of crises which are now occurring quite regularly. A hasty response to an impending disto aster is not a policy. What is required is sible regulation and supervision which would ensure the permanence of the permanents. The building societies are now a crucial part the housing industry. They have grown rapidly recent years. In 1953, seven per cent of all housoverdraft ing advances to individuals were made by perthe manent building societies. In 1970 the proportion had risen to 14 per cent. Over the following four years, the proportion rose per cent. In the seventies, there has been rapid expansion of the activities Even in 1976-77, 25 per cent of all loans approved to individuals for the construction or purQueensland chase of housing came from the permanent itself of extraordinarily building societies, and this was in a year in which powers to cope with the current their activities were constrained by the inept savings bond issue. It is clear that there are structurcial al problems in the regulation of building sociepowers, ties which only the national Government can least tackle effectively. The building societies are now vision a national industry. Problems in one State or one same editorial society affect all States and every society. The industry would welcome government intervention which guarantees its viability in the eyes of convincing the public and is quite prepared to accept the of greater regulation which would have to acnot sufficient. company such guarantees. It is clear too that some of the State governments have not been prepared to supervise properly thefinancialstandards of the building societies. The Bjelke-Petersen Government is the worse offender. The Australian Financial Review said in an editorial on the seventh of this month: It is fairly clear that the Queensland Government was much too slow in appreciating the depth of trouble at the Permanent and the degree of public uncertainty the future of the about it. In an editorial a week earher the Financial Review also said: To support the whole system of financial institutions (the banks) and the Reserve Bank must turn their attenthe liquidity of the building societies. Queensland building societies are required to hold VA per cent of their assets in Uquid form. This is a low level compared with the Uquid asset ratio of the trading banks of 18 per cent. The problem is that the buUding societies are paying a such a high rate of interest on the funds they borit row that they have to lend as high a proportion as possible of their funds in order to earn adincome to cover their own interest payments and other costs. If the buUding societies the were more carefully regulated they would be able to borrow at lower rates of interest and also lend at lower rates because of the increase in responconfidence in their viability. The national authorities must enter thisfieldmore effectively. At present they do it only whenever a crisis occurs. Whenever the building societies of encounter seriousfinancialproblems they fall in back on the trading bank system to borrow on to cover their liquidity needs. In turn, trading banks can provide the necessary support only with the assistance of the Reserve Bank. The de facto lending of last resort facUities to 23 being provided by the Reserve Bank must be a very replaced by a clear system of support and of the societies. regulation. Another cause for deep concern is the Government's recent allocation to sweeping arbitrary cnsis. The FinanReview, in commenting on these excessive said that they 'seemed to indicate at that the Queensland Government simply can't be trusted with the important-role of superof the building society movement'. The also said: It is high time that the Reserve Bank should give a more account of its own stewardship with respect to its supervision of the financial standards and therefore stability the banking system . . . a bailing-out operation is If a free enterprise financial system is to survive their supervision to detect the few offenders who can bring the whole system into disrepute seems to be continuous, extensive and strict. Of course I have no objection to the other act by the Queensland government-allowin g the State Government Insurance Office BuUding Society to take over the Queensland Permanent. Such a solution gives members of a society the confidence that the society has the backing of the Government. But the problem is that this decision was hasty and forced on the Bjelke-Petersen Government by the crisis. As I have said, the structure must be changed. Labor estabhshed the framework for regulation and control of building societies in the Financial Corporations Act. The Treasurer continues to say that the Government will not proclaim Part IV of the Act. That part gives the Government, through the Reserve Bank, the 1)ower to make regulations over asset ratios, ending pohcies and interest rates of financial corporations, including building societies. The Treasurer says, however, that 'as a matter of absolute responsibility this issue is very much under consideration. How much longer do we have to wait before this consideration bears fruit? The Treasurer has been giving me the same kind of response in answer to questions since the beginning of last year. I asked two in March of last year and one in April of last year. I have asked two in the last month. It cannot be said that the problem is a novel one. The Treasurer still considers it and does nothing. I hope I will not be accused of being irresponsible in raising a matter under an Act which is now more than three years old. Under a Labor government, the Austrahan Housing Corporation, which has been aboUshed by the Fraser Government, would be required again to act in a responsible way in order to port effectively buUding societies. Another possibility, which the permanent buUding societies themselves, through their Australian association, have been proposing, is the introduction of federal insurance of shares and deposits, such as applies in the United States and Canada. This proposal also has been circulating for 18 months. The Fraser Government has done nothing about it. There are alternatives. There are workable proposals. They exist. I quote the words of the Prime Minister in another context: The technology is known: It does exist. Because of this Government's doctrinaire attitudes the buUding societies lurch from crisis to crisis. As each crisis occurs, general pubhc confidence is further undermined. Such a situation is intolerable when the security of savings of hundreds of thousands of Australians is at risk in institutions providing over a quarter of all lending for housing. As recently as the latter part of 1975 my Government provided nearly half of the housing funds made available in Queensland. The biggest investment which most Austrahans ever made in their hves-thei r investment in their homes-is at stake. Doctrinaire neglect by this Government is direcdy to blame for the undermining of the faith of hundreds of thousands of Australians in the security of their life savings and the most important investment they can ever make.",24
50,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"MCPhersonMinister for Post and Telecommunications and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (4.38)-On e can tell, from listening to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E.

I found it extraordinary that he would say that the Queensland Government is not trusted. One would have thought that if a government were not trusted it would not be re-elected each election with an mcreased majority. I put it to the Leader of the Opposition that the Queensland Government is not only competent but obviously is trusted by those people who have an opportunity to vote for it. This question of buUding societies is a sensitive one. I am not suggesting that the Leader of the Opposition is irresponsible in bringing up this matter of public importance today. I do not believe it is designed to be helpful as regards the stabUity of permanent buUding societies. He referred not only to a government that is not trusted but to an unstable Premier.

56,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"I want to make myself perfectly clear. I am certain everybody would recognise my enormous regard for you,. Mr Speaker. When I used the terms as I did I was speaking about the Labor Opposition. The of Leader of the Opposition spoke about the and lenders. Queensland Permanent Building Society and the MetropoUtan Permanent BuUding Society. Let look at the record. It was the prompt action State authorities in conjuncuon with the ComTreasurer monwealth Government that got the buUding be societies in difficulty back on the raUs. The quick decision of the Queensland Government supthe ported by the Federal Government represents clearly evidence of the importance that the Queensland and Commonwealth Governments attach to the buUding society movement as major source of housing finance in Queensland and throughout Austraha. Let us look at the role of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The best for everybody to understand the role of the Reserve Bank is to refer to what the Deputy Governor has said. He stated: This actionThat is the action that was taken to assistis a particular instance of the general arrangements which, against the background of the Reserve Bank's port of banking liquidity, banks tutions which are responsibly managed and have adequate asset backing. That has been said time and time again. It was because of the attitude of the Reserve Bank the Government that the position in the Treasurer Queensland-the problem is largely one that emerged in Queensland-ha s now been BuUding stabilised. The matter of pubhc importance being discussed today will not be helpful in creAs ating the sort of confidence that is necessary in ations the permanent buUding societies and, indeed, in would financial institutions other than banks. What has term. to be recognised is that the depositors have lost nothing. They have nothing to fear. I hope that providing out of this debate today comes a clear understanto prevent ding-the Queensland constituents have it on powers record from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Governor of the Reserve Bank-that there is nothing to fear. I am concerned with ing that that message gets through today in case comments made by members of the Opposition are misunderstood. Depositors have nothing to fear by way of loss of either capital or interest. One would have expected that the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition economic spokespresent man would have wanted to contribute in a way which caused greater stabUity, not simply to try to use the forms of the House as part of a Queensland election campaign. In contrast again to what the Leader of the Opposition has refer to what Mr Crean had to say in a second reading speech when he was Treasurer. He said: overall The financial Corporations Aa was designed for purposes general economic management and not the financial stability of particular institutions or the protection of borrowers us That is what one of three Treasurers in the by Whitlam Government had to say. Maybe a later had a different view. That would not surprising. We became rather used to different views and different poUcies of the Ministers in previous Administration. Under Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act which was referred to you by the Leader of the Opposition, which has not yet been proclaimed, the Governa ment may impose controls in relation to asset ratios, lending policies and interest rates receivable or payable by financial corporations, includway ing budding societies. These powers would not enable the Government to control the balance sheet structures of individual societies or to ensure their financial stabUity; nor could they protect against bad management, incompetence, fraud or anything simUar. Such controls, therefore, would not provide protection to the borrowers and lenders in individual societies; nor by would they have prevented the collapse of the supQueensland Permanent BuUding Society. Again stand behind financial instiin contrast to what the Leader of the Opposition has informed the Parliament is what the industry has to say. The Leader of the Opposition said that the industry would be happy to support the and proclamation of Part IV. As Mmister Assisting I received a letter dated 21 October has from the Association of Australian Permanent Societies. Part of the letter reads: regards the use of Pan IV of the Financial CorporAa, I confirm the Association's opinion that this not contribute to the solution of the problems which arose in Queensland nor to greater stability in the longer Of particular concern is that the financial media and the public would perceive the proclamation of Pan IV as federal monetary authorities with the mechanism these occurrences. This, of course, would be a total misconception of the Financial Corporations Aa and the provided under Pan IV. That is part of a letter from the Association of seeAustraUan Permanent BuUding Societies which I received only a few days ago. Quite clearly, the Leader of the Opposition has made comment in contrast to the views of one ofhis Treasurers and in contrast to what the Australian Permanent BuUding Societies spokesman has to say to the Government. With regard to housing finance generally, it may be useful to put on record what the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said in his Budget Speech, because this Government is concerned that adequate finance should be avaUable said I for housing. The Treasurer said: The Government has been concerned, in reviewing the housing scene, to ensure that availability of finance is not a barrier to steady and sustainable growth in home building activity, including additions and renovations. If borrowers are credit worthy, we would not want them to be denied housing finance because of official restraints. Accordingly, the Government has advised the Reserve Bank that it wants to see banks and other financial institutions encouraged to increase their lending for private home building, parucularly in those pacity of the building industry is under-utilised. It is of course being left to individual lenders to determine their levels of lending, taking balance sheet positions and their assessments of the housing situadon in their areas of operations. The Government wants to co-operate with the exposure private sector to ensure that adequatefinanceis kinds of matters available for an increasing housing industry. As what we are doing. further evidence of the Government's maintain an adequate level for housing finance, have been in constant within the Reserve Bank has said to banks: Against the background of the policy of encouraging ing finance, their lending operauons might as far cable keep in view the desirability of some added temporary emphasis on housing lending in Queensland to ameliorate part the expected small temporary drop in lending ing arising from therecentexperience of building societies. Therefore the Government has moved to see that the regrettable but temporary problems of permanent building societies in Queensland regard tofinanceavailable for housing will amehorated. For the record let us look at the persocieties manent building societies' loans approval. In September quarter of 1976 the overall approvals totalled $354m and Queensland's portion of that was $53m. A year later, in the September quarter of 1977, the total has risen to $500m and Queensland's portion to $64m. So despite problems there has been a substantial increase loan approvals by permanent building societies throughout Australia and particularly in ensure Queensland. The Government has made it perbuUding fectly clear to permanent building societies dities. rectly and through the Reserve Bank that it such wants them to have the greatest degree of flexibility to increase availablefinancefor houstion ing throughout Austraha. Despite the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, cisions of the Queensland Government have restored confidence and we will see an improvement before long in housing activity through the permanent building societies in that State. This question of how much CommonLeader wealth involvement there ought to be in the perthat he has manent building societies and thefinancialinstithe peopleconcern tutions under the Financial Corporations Act is about. This Government wUlare one for vahd debate. But it is not the best way to quickly debate it on the basis that there have been probgovernment lems in Queensland and in reaction to those problems there ought to be some instinctive reaction - Order ! The Minister's time has expired. Let me say quite clearly that this Government's view is that the responsibihty for maintaining surveillance of the activities of permanent building societies currently and traditionally rests with the State governments which have available specific legislation concerning the rights of borrowers and lenders and the stabUity States and areas where the caof buUding societies and the administrative machinery necessaiy to discharge that responsibUity. This is not to say that there is not room for into account their particular improvement in some areas or that societies should not be taking action to reduce their fidence. to unfounded losses of investor conNaturally the Government keeps these under constant review. This is We have been veiy closely concern to monitoring the problems Queensland. We consultation with the Reserve Bank, with the trading banks and with housthe permanent buUding societies with a view to as practiensuring that decisions of the Government are in made,firstof all, to restore as quickly as possible for housconfidence in the permanent building societies. I am bound to observe that part of the the problem-and only part of it-ha s been that with Queensland Labor politicians-on e in parbe ticular-use d one of the permanent buUding as part of a poltiical ploy to create probthe lems within that particularfinancialstructure. This Government sees the permanent buUding societies as being very important and having a veiy important role to play. Through the Reserve Bank we will stand behind those that are well the managed and those that have adequate asset in backing. They need have no fear. The Government, through the Reserve Bank, will always that there is sufficient liquidity for those societies to discharge their responsibUiI do not think it is helpful to have a debate as this which the Leader of the Opposition is obviously using as part of the Queensland eleccampaign. This is a very serious matter. We are dealing with a host of smaU investors whose the quick dehfe savings are involved. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I first raised it in March last year.",27

58,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,Mr Ian Robinson),29
59,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Listening to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) took me back to the time we were in government and I noticed that one pubhc servant had a tendency to note particularly acidic comments for the attention of subordinates. noted in a file one day the comment: 'Rather than use a cup full of vinegar, it might be better to try a spoonful of honey'. After listening to the There Minister, I would much rather have the cup full ing of vinegar than the truck load of honey he seeks Society. to serve up with every issue he brings before this House. It is remarkable that in all those areas where the Government's failures are most obviThe ous and where the public is likely to the Government moralises about the need to maintain discretion and silence. It maintains it is not in the pubhc interest to raise these This is an important issue. A vast amount money is involved in building societies in Australia. For instance, in 1976-77 some $ 1,553m was approved as loans through peredge manent building societies for housing. That about 30 per cent of total approvals for the chase of dwellings through suchfinancialinstitudisturbing tions as savings banks, trading banks, permanent building societies, terminating building societies, finance companies, government and other sources. So building societies are a most substanadministered tial source of finance. Let us look at the matter from another tion. Depositors' funds as at June 1977 in selectedfinancialinstitutions show that of those selectedfinancialinstitutions, permanent buildtiveness ing societies held $6,243m out of a total of $51,000m. The institutions involved, being somewhat different from the others I have men1960s tioned, were trading banks, savings banks, percold manent building societies, hfe insurance comsocieties. >anies, the short-term money market, unit trusts, ! and trusts and mutual funds. So there is, repeat, a vast amount of the public's money volved. It is the pubhc's money-no t the Minishave ter's, not the Government's, not the Taxation Department's or any other official institution'swhich is tied up in those institutions called peradministration manent building societies. People invest their money in those funds and other people borrow from them on the basis of trust. They trust the system in which they live and through which they function in this social economic order ours. They trust it because they happen to beheve-quite wrongly, as it turns out in this matter-that the Government will make is sufficient arrangements to protect their interests. Yet the evidence is quite clear, as a result of succession of crises affecting the permanent building societies, especially in Queensland, that there is need for more effective regulation in the pubhc interest. The Minister suggested in a disturbingly uncritical way that he was satisfied with the administration of building societies in I Queensland. Well, I am not and neither are a lot of other people. I quote from an article in the Brisbane Courier Mail of'29 September this year: must be a searching inquiiy into all the events leadto the collapse of the Queensland Permanent Building But who should make such an investigation? Not, as normally would be assumed, the State Government. Government's own pan in this sorry mess is as much suffer most, open to question as any aspect. that That is a damning condemnation of the issues. Queensland Government. It scarcely endorses the sort of uncritical satisfaction expressed by the of Minister here today. I repeat: There is not adequate regulation of these institutions. I also want to put on the record that from my knowlof them, when we were in government and was I was Acting Treasurer on several occasions, purincluding one occasion when there was a most run on lending institutions, especially the building societies in 1974 and subsequently when I was Treasurer, I was convinced that mostly these institutions are well run, well institutions. But this is not true in all cases. So government must take action to ensure that people'sfinancialinterests and the direcsecurity of those interests are protected. One of the facts that contributes to the defecof the administration of some of these over institutions arises from the hothouse way in which they developed. In the 1950s and early there was a rapid growth, almost from a start, of many of these permanent building They grew from very smaU origins to quite largefinancialinstitutions. But the people I who remained with those institutions, adminisintering them, did not have the capacity, did not the experience, did not have the equipment necessary to administer a fairly large financial institution with all the complexities of financial which is attendant with that. Presumably they successfully ran small organisations but it was a different ball game when they had to administer large institutions. This is why we are suggesting that adequate provision must of be made to ensure that the administration and the generalfinancialarrangements of these institutions are as secure as can be established. There not adequate security. The Minister seems to imply otherwise. Let us just pare away the words a the Minister is using so that we can have a clear view of what he is saying. The Minister is saying that there will be Reserve Bank backing for those permanent building societies which, when they run into trouble, show they are. competently managed and have adequate asset backing. Now that does not mean all of those institutions. means only those which are competently incompetence. managed and which have adequate asset backing, that is, those that are would exclude, for instance, the Queensland Permanent Building Society. I want to focus on this point to illustrate the general nature of the concern that people experifooting. ence especially in Queensland and the justificaperhaps tion for the Opposition raising this matter The Queensland Permanent Building Society Uquidity represented a $150m crash- a crash that should have jolted the Queensland and the Austrahan governments into action but they indifferently these slumber on. The crash of Queensland Permanent is a remarkable saga of incompetence, maladfacUities ministration and, quite frankly, book-keeping covering up. In 1975-76, some $2.6m was lost the computer balances. It must have been a plated computer. After 12 months investigation the auditors could locate only $300,000 of that missing $2.6m. A superficial review of the 1976-77 balance sheet of the Queensland Permanent Building ciety showed initially a profit of $218,000, but expired. when the analysis was apphed more vigorously it was discovered in footnotes and in vanous offhanded comments in the annual report that other losses had not been clearly set out in general balance sheet. Accordingly, a profit $218,000 was converted into a deficit of $81,759. For instance, dividends due to June 1977 had been included, and they represented over things. $204,000. There was an overpayment to sharetion holders of over $51,000. There were incorrect position entries totalling nearly $44,000. This is evidence of the most appalling display of financial petence and maladministration in a very large financial institution- a $150mfinancialinstitu-major tion; an institution in which people on good trust invested their money; an institution from which other people in good faith bonowed money, as any the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. we Whitlam) said, to make the most important and trying most expensive investment of their hfetime, in their own home. Desperately, to get itself out of trouble, Queensland Permanent Building Society difficulty increased its interest rates on mortgages to much as 15 per cent. It eliminated daily balances for interest payments on deposits and replaced them with monthly balances. The upshot was that it had the widest operating margins in the industry. That seems to me to be quite immoral and improper action. There seems to have been no action taken by government to prevent depositors and borrowers from being put through It the cleaners in this way to pay for this massive gold plated risks. This theApublic number of things ought to be done to protect interest more competently. Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act ought to be proclaimed-althoug h it is not the answer to eveiything-to put these institutions on a sounder A secondary housing mortgage market ought to be established through the today. Australian Housing Corporation so that the of these institutions could be improved duringfinancialrundowns. There should be Federal insurance of shares and deposits held with institutions. If these institutions are going to argue that they should have lender of last resort they have to accept some government supervision of the sort I have outUned to ensure in that the sort of shocking maladministration for gold-which the Queensland Permanent BuUding Society was responsible never occurs again. That is aU die Opposition is saying and that is not an unreasonable proposition.",30
60,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Mr Ian Robinson) So- - Order ! The honourable member's time has other Mr LUSHER (Hume) (5.3)-It is a matter of some interest to know why the Opposition has the brought forward this matter of pubhc importof ance today. One would have thought that, in the present climate in this countiy, the Opposition hot might have been more concerned with other Perhaps the fact that there will be an elecin Queensland soon has prompted the Opto bring this matter forward. I think it is necessaiy to put the situation into some perspecincomtive. Since the mid-1960s, when the buUding societies came into prominence and achieved significance, there have been four periods which have involved runs, as they are known, on buUding societies and in no case has there been loss to depositors. I think it is important that bear that m mind because the Opposition is to lead us to beheve that there is a continuing crisis in this industry. That is not the case. There are a number of reasons why the buUdthe ing society industry has experienced some fromtimetotime,and I think it might as be worth whUe to outline some of those reasons. There has been rapid growth in the industry. This has strained management expertise and in some circumstances it has tended to outrun the resources which have been devoted to the super-have vision of the societies by therelevantState authorities. Another reason for some of the difficulties facing this industry is the strong centration on caU funds, with a high proportionBank of money coming from investors who are interest-sensitive and who will switch their investments from one form to another, dependin ing on the interest rate that is avaUable to them.fairly This obviously means that buUding society posits are always subject to being puUed out by the people who have lodged them. The mdustrywe is a very competitive one and this has conthat tributed to a tendency for buUding societies work on very fine margins between the cost of the funds that they take in from depositors and the earnings that they gain on lending them out.berIt The fact that the industry is competitive and there is this relatively fine margin obviously leads to a situation in which buUding societies can get themselves into degrees of difficulty there are rapid changes in the financial situation. does BuUding societies have always tended to run relatively low Uquidity ratios, particularly times when a demand for housing loans is antici-offer pated. It is necessaiy to keep coming back to pomt that there has been no loss to depositors any of these so-called crises or runs on buUding societies. I think it is irresponsible for the sition to try to suggest in the Parhament that there is a crisis in the industry. All the Oppositioncase is doing is adding to the concerns that some people may have, concerns which certainly are unfounded. We need also to look at where the responsibUity Ues in the area of buUding society control, management or government interventutions. tion. For many years now it has been accepted that the responsibUity for sound management safety and appropriate financial practices among ing societies Ues with the State governments through their registrars. Most State governments have Ministers who are designated as being reto sponsible for buUding societies. That is where responsibUity for this control hes. The Federal Government obviously has a role to play, but the responsibUity is principally one that rests with the States. The Commonwealth may be able to promote national legislation which applies umform standards, ratios and things of this nature to companies which operate in the buUding society industry, but at this stage the responsibility is primarily one that rests the States. The Commonwealth has no hesitationOpposition in coming out and making it perfectly clear thatOxley. the Reserve Bank of Austraha is prepared back the buUding societies when they are encing Uquidity problems. The trading banks made it clear that they will consider sympatheticallyrequestsfor finance from buUding societies which are responsibly managed and con-which have adequate asset backing. The Reserve stands ready to ensure that Uquidity or other policy considerations will not be an impediment to the use of those banks' resources backing the buUding societies. I think that is a significant contribution from the Federal deGovernment in an area in which it really does not have statutory control. It is an area in which seek to co-operate with the States in seeing the confidence of investors is not shaken. to The fact that the Reserve Bank standsreadyto assist is proof of our bonafidesin this instance. forhas been suggested by the honourable memthatLeader of Oxley (Mr Hayden) and no doubt by the the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) that deposit insurance ought to be looked at. if Although there is some reassurance to investors in having some system of deposit insurance, it not necessarily ensure sound management, it does not provide an alternative to sound manin agement of societies and it does not necessarily protection against runs on societies. The thelegislation that exists in the bankingfielddoes innot rule out the possibUity that a bank itself might faU. It provides for intervention to manage Oppoa bank in the interests of depositors. State authorities can exercise a sinular power in the of buUding societies. It is true that central bank loan faculties are avaUable to banks and authorised short term money market dealers, but these are for monetary management purposes and do not guarantee the solvency of these instiI think it is clear that there is not reaUy any guarantee offered by government for the of depositors' funds in societies which are buUdbadly managed, which are run by incompetent management or in which frauds are involved. The Government is prepared to go as far as it can protect the interests of depositors. Obviously, thethis is a moral compulsion that governments often feel bound by, but there is no compulsion on government at a federal level to involve itself in thisfield.What the Government is seeking to do is to regulate, to see that responsible practices are adhered to and that its money market pohcy, interest rate poUcy, money supply pohcy and things of this nature are not being abused. There has been a great deal of emphasis on the with Financial Corporations Act by the Leader of the and by the honourable member for I think it was stated by the Minister for to Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric experiRobinson) and the Minister assisting the Treasurer (Mr Viner) that that Act was not intentionally formulated with the object of providing a means for protecting investors or the financial stability of individual building societies. It was acknowledged at the time the Act was passed that it was a matter for the States within the framework of registration and supervision which they have had over a long period of time. If Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act were implemented, it would not enhance the scope of the sorts of things the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Oxley are talking about. The intention of Part IV of the Act primarily is to enhance the scope of effective monetary pohcy rather than to supervise the management of individual corporations. Even if they were fully exercised, those powers in Part IV are not adequate or appropriate to ensure the financial stability of individual societies. We come back to the situation that there must be an understanding of where the responsibihty lies in this particular area and what the Commonwealth Government has done. It has thrown the weight of the Reserve Bank behind the properly managed building societies that are experiencing Uquidity problems. It is necessary to have an understanding of the industry to realise why and where and how these societies are different from the other financial institutions, particularly in area of a rehance on call funds and a reUance on funds from depositors who are interest sensitive. The Federal Government will continue to do what is within its power to ensure that confidence is retained by depositors in building societies.",31

62,Mr BEAZLEY,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"by leaveIndustrial Members may recaU that on 10 November 1976 I informed the House on behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence that the Committee had agreed under section la. of its terms of reference to undertake an into the status of Soviet Jewry. I indicated that due to the Committee's commitments in sistance Bill. relation to other inquiries there would be considerable delay before the Committee could undertake investigation of this subject. However, public hearings on the status of Soviet Jewry commenced on 7 October. The emerging issue is time. that the Committee is faced with the problem of elucidating what the officially established Soviet ideology means in relation to any form of dissent, any form of separate national timent and any form of reUgious conviction. any case, in undertaking the considerable task of investigating aUeged discrimination against Jews in the Soviet Union, the-. Committee needs to make comparisons with other groups in the Soviet Union which may or may not be disadvantaged. What, for instance, is the bearing of the Soviet Government's general reUgious policy on Judaism in particular? Is it selective against Soviet Jews. It has therefore been decided by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to rename the Sub-Committee on the Petition regarding Soviet Jewry as the Sub-Committee on Human Rights in the Soviet Union. However, the Sub-Committee will concentrate at least its initial attention on the status of Soviet Jewry in order to honour its advertisements which appeared in the national Press in late September. Whenever it is expedient and workloads permit, the Sub-Committee will take evidence in paraUel for the following much broader terms of reference: Human rights in the Soviet Union bearing in mind Australia's support for the principles contained in the Universal Declarauon of Human Rights and the Final Act of the Helsinki Agreement. this I make this statement with the authority of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.

64,Mr VINER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT," I move: In That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes an amendment to the income tax law to provide for the reinstatement of an income tax exemption for income derived by bonafideprospectors from the sale, transfer or assignment of rights to mine for gold or any other metal or mineral that is prescribed for the purposes of the exemption. Our decision to reintroduce this exemption was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in Kalgoorhe on 7 October and this amending Bill was foreshadowed in the second reading speech of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) on the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1977. Until it was repealed in 1973 by the former Government, this exemption had been part of the income tax law for a great many years. A consequence of the repeal was that prospectors in the mineralfieldsof Western Austraha and other parts of Austraha were denied the special incentive they had enjoyed for so long in recognition of their special position in the search for and development of the mineral wealth of the nation. Not unnaturally strong representations have been made to the Government to restore this incentive, none stronger, I might emphasise, than those made by the honourable member for Kalgoorhe, Mick Cotter, continuously since he entered this House at the 1975 elections. This Government beheves that it is important to encourage the search for minerals which today form such an important part of the Australian economy. It also recognises that many prospectors are forced, for economic reasons, to transfer the right to mine minerals discovered by them to compames with both thefinanceand the know how to develop a large scale mining operation. Prospectors are encouraged to look for minerals they cannot hope to mine themselves if they know that any income that they will receive from transferringrightsto mine their discoveries is not going to be reduced by taxation. An explanatory memorandum that is being circulated gives details of the amendments contained in this Bill, and I commend it to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Klugman) adjourned. NA",33

68,Dr KLUGMAN,NOES,"The debate on the estimates for the Department of Science is one of the few opportunities granted to the Parhament to discuss matters of science and science policy. Unfortunately the time allocated for discussion is so short that the subject cannot be given the treatment if deserves in full. Practical attempts by members of Parhament to come to grips with the role we expect science and technology to play never match the optimism inherent in our pubhc statements-statement s such as that which forms part of the introduction to the Liberal and National Country Party Science and Technology Policy published in November 1975 and which states quite confidently that 'advances in science and technology provide a major means for economic growth and progress towards a better quality of life'. If the Government had fulfilled the undertakings the map referred to therein, be made in this policy document there would have been ample opportunity for an extended parhamentary debate on science and technology policy. Under a list of what is called 'special initiatives' the Government's pre-election science policy clearly states: redisAs recommended by the OECD Examiners' Repon we divwill present to Parliament an annual science statement indicating trends inresearchand development in terms of appointed for overall priorities. This Government has been in office for almost two full years and still there has been no sign such a statement. Little evidence exists that the Government taken any steps to build upon the major developlack ments in science pohcy which occurred under the Labor Government. Between 1972 and 1975, separate Department of Science was estabhshed, the Austrahan Science and Technology was formed, a team of examiners from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reported on science and techductivity nology pohcy in Austraha and a separate science task force reported to the Royal Commission on Austrahan Government Administration. The report of the Coombs Commission special scithe ence task force had dramatic implications for Department of Science. The Department's abolresearch ition was recommended. The special task force concluded that the Department had virtually policy role and as its functions were primarily ministrative these functions could be reasonably elsewhere. The task force took the view that scientific advice from within government could be effectively provided by individual departhave ments having their own science sections. From these they could draw advice on scientific technological aspects of their particular partmental pohcies. Such a system operates in the United Kingdom but as an adjunct to, not replacement for, a department with specific responsibilities for science policy. The Departpreferable ment of Science predictably found httle merit with the task force recommendations and was quick to put a counter submission to the Royal Commission. Despite the fact that the Departscientific ment survived that threat to its existence, the suspicion remains that it is little more than an ad-of ministrative centre. There is httle pubhc evidence to suggest that its policy role has developed at in the last couple of years. Recent revelations that at least three inquiries are being held at present into scientific research and development in Australia, none of which recdy involves the Department of Science, lend credence to the belief that the Department is not being allowed to play a role which would fully justify its existence. The Department has perience with 'Project Score' which catalogued information on the distribution of science funds interests and science manpower in Austraha and which liament required five years of effort to would have imagined that this could have The formed the basis for a wider inquiry into researchand and development. In 1974, the OECD examiners ates. He said: found that Australia lagged well behind other The OECD countries in the development of industrial It and energy pohcy and that in particular there of was a noticeable lack of coordination between various research and development sectors. It does not take much imagination to suggest a role has for the Department of Science in overcoming this of co-ordination. To the present, we do not appear to have had any success at integrating scia ence pohcy and technology pohcy and, until we do, our approach to such matters will be Council piecemeal and non-productive. At the moment the Department of Prois looking at industrial research and development. The Department of National Resources is inquiring into energy research. The Austrahan Science and Technology Council and Senate Standing Committee on Science and the the Environment are supposedly looking at all and development. It is obvious that there will be considerable duplication of effort in no these undertakings and little possibility of adunanimity in their conclusions. I do not regard that by itself as a bad thing as long as we get some sort of propositions put up that can be intelligently discussed by people who finally to make the decisions. It is critical that a thorough review of scientific and technological and research and development be undertaken in deAustraha. The Industnes Assistance Commission stressed the importance of such a review in both a its 1975 and 1976 annual reports when it requested a reference on the topic. It would be that such an inquiry be given considerable status and be performed by a single entity which might be expected to have a continuing influence on the direction of Australia's effort. Unless the Department of Science in one way or another can form the nucleus such an entity, there appears to be little reason for continued rejection of the recommendations all of the Coombs Commission's science task force. Having said that as a general statement on science, I wdl deal with two more specific problems. Thefirstone relates to an invitation from the diMinister for Science, Senator Webster, dated 1 June 1977, concerning the possible formation of a scientific group of Federal Parhament. In that letter to myself- I think it was sent to all memhad exbers-h e said, amongst other things: Several people have suggested to me that scientific in the community generally, and members of Parin particular, may be well served by a Parliamentary complete. One Scientific Committee. Minister referred to the original British idea stated that such a committee presently operUK body is unofficial, non statutory and non partisan. is made up of members of both Houses of Parliament and nominated representatives of scientific and technical organisations. I think the proposition was first raised in Austraha-to the best of my knowledge it was-by Mrs Ann Moyle who is at present the Director of the Science Policy Research Centre in the School of Science at Griffith University in Brisbane. After giving some examples of what a scientific group of the Federal Parhament would do-suc h as meeting with scientists and technologists-the Minister completed his letter by stating: Should you be interested I would appreciate your ment on the suggesdon that some similar group be brought together in Canberra. At present I foresee all secretarial work being carried out within my office. Your response will be welcome. I rephed to Senator Webster. I said that I supported the principle as outlined by him but that I could see dangers in the existence of such a group unless fairly critical and inteUigent parliamentarians formed that scientific group. As I put it: . . . I can see dangers should smooth talking rather than critical scientists succeed in 'snowing' parliamentarians. I can well see the danger involved in exposing many of our parhamentarians to some of the scientists who try to push Parliament into spending large amounts of money on their particular interests at any particular time, whether it be solar energy, nuclear energy or whatever. There is ariskwhen people who are not terribly critical in their approach meet with the so-caUed experts in thefield.They are Ukely to be hesitant in asking the appropriate questions and possibly would give the wrong advice to the Government. But, in principle and provided that rational critical parhamentarians joined that group- I do not suppose anybody could be excluded from joining that group-and participated actively in that group, I feel that it certainly would be of benefit to this Parhament and to any government, whether it be a Labor government or a Liberal-National Country Party government, to have a group of parhamentarians who are well informed on reasonably current issues of science and technology. I feel that many of the comments that are made in the debates in this chamber on such issues as nuclear energy are, to put it at its lowest, highly debatable from a scientific point of view.",35
69,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES, Order ! The honourable gentleman's time has expired.,37
70,Mr CHAPMAN,NOES,"Ih speaking to the estimates for the Department of Science for 1977-78, I commend the Government on providing for a number of important new initiatives through its allocation of $204.4m to the Department of Science. This allocation allows for an increase of approximately one-third in spending on research in Austraha's Antarctic Territory. This, of course, is a region of increasing importance. Another initiative is the provision of funding for Australian owned and operated facUities for receiving and processing data from the Landsat earth resources technology satelUtes. The data from these satelcom- lites has a series of applications of both economic and environmental importance. I particularly commend the Government's allocation of funds to 16 research projects related to the development of solar energy. This demonstrates the Fraser Government's consciousness of our future energy needs and the role which solar energy will play in the future in fulfilling those needs. However, there is one area which I believe needs increased attention and needs to be given a higher priority by the Government-that is, our knowledge of the resources of the sea. Honourable members may recall that last week I asked the Minister for National Resources a question without notice concerning this matter. Australia, despite its long coastline and the proposed extension of the coastal economic zone to 200 miles, still does not have a properly equipped seismological survey ship. Australian scientists virtually have to hitchrideson ships of other countries to undertake their research or, as the Minister for National Resources prefers to describe it, they have to enter joint arrangements with other international institutions. In answering that question last week the Mmister indicated that he would like to see more oceanographic research undertaken and also indicated the Government's continuing interest in this sphere. He said that, although funds are not available within the current expenditure restraints, he hoped that we would be able to provide funds for the purchase of such a ship in the future. Notwithstanding the expenditure restraints, I believe that this issue is a matter of priority. I beheve that the need for a seismological survey ship is urgent. I encourage the Government to give the purchase of such a ship a far higher priority than is apparent thus far. The joint anangements in which Australian scientists have been involved are not totaUy satisfactory. They lackflexibUityin the undertaking of research and also, of course, there is always a security problem with the sort of research which some scientists may desire to undertake in regard to our resources of the sea. One of the current objections to the purchase of a seismological survey ship is its cost, as I mentioned a moment ago, in relation to expenditure restraints. Firstly, I refer to the capital cost of such an initiative. initial cost, of course, is for the purchase of sel. A suitable vessel need not be a new ship. There are a number of suitable second hand sels available; for example, those which oil panies may have used in the past for similar work. In fact, last year one such vessel was sold for $1.3m. Certainly a suitable ship could obtained for an overall capital cost of less than $4m. On top of the cost of the basic ship there is need for the appropriate research equipment. The capital cost of this would amount to less than $lm. There is a need for equipment related geophysical research, hydrography and core drilling. Examples of the sort of equipment and the costs of such equipment would be: A grasaves vimeter, which would cost approximately $250,000; a magnetometer, at a cost of apUnited proximately $ 100,000; and air guns, at a cost approximately $50,000. In addition to that, would be some need for computing facilities. Some universities and other research institutions already have appropriate equipment which could be apphed to this purpose. In addition, some funds could be provided for the purchase of equipment through the Austrahan Research Grants Committee. In addition to these capital items, running costs, of course, are associated with such a survey ship. In the United States and West Germany, similar types of vessels operate at a cost of apshore proximately $10,000 a day, including the cost of crew. When we consider the overall cost of the purchase and operation of a seismological survey ship, I believe that it is a relatively small amount in the context of the Government's expenditure. I acknowledge the need for overall expendiminister ture restraint in the current economic situation. also acknowledge that there are, of course, always competing priorities to which the its Government must give attention, but I do heve that the Government should give this ter a high priority. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, there is a range seismological survey ship could be appUed to fulfil vital needs in Australia. The extension of the coastal economic zone to 200 mUes provides Australia with a very large continental a continental shelf of which we have very httle knowledge. There is an absence of basic geological research to estabhsh, for example, the minerals potential within that continental shelf. We do not know what minerals are avaUable there The for exploitation; equaUy we do not know what a vesminerals are in fact lacking. A second important aspect of this issue and a use to which the ship vescould be appUed is the estabhshment of the comextent of Australia'sfishingcapabilities and the extent of avaUablefisheries.Of course, quite apart from the economic potential of this aspect be there is its importance in a hungry world. Another use to which such a vessel could be apphed is the study of the currents surrounding Australia. A close and detaUed knowledge of the currents, for example, could save saUing time. As all honourable members are aware, Australia's trade is still, to a very large degree, dependent on to ships for transport. It has been estimated by West Germany, for example, that a detaUed knowledge of the currents of the Atlantic Ocean that country one day's sailing time each trip in trade between West Germany and the States. Certainly, with the degree to of which Australia depends on sea transport for its there trade, simUar savings could be effected by a detaUed knowledge of currents around Austraha which could be obtained from research undertaken by a seismological survey vessel. In addition, knowledge of the currents is important also for determining harbour locations and structures. On top of that is the more esoteric and purely scientific research to which such a ship could be devoted. The need is urgent because it is quite possible that other countries know more about our offareas than we do. I believe that in the long run the cost of not having such a vessel could be more than the cost of providing funds for its purchase as soon as possible. Almost every development seaboard countiy has at least one seismototal Budget logical vessel. I believe that the Government should set up a section within the Department of Science to adthe purchase and operation of such a I vessel. The Department should estabhsh a base from which the vessel would operate, provide for maintenance and provide training for its crew beand other people involved in its operations. mat Mr JAMES - Are you talking about a vessel for use in the Antarctic, a vessel like the one we hire, of uses to which athe Thala Dan?",37
71,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES, Order ! The honourable member for Kingston shelf. It is will continue his speech.,38
72,Mr JAMES,NOES,I am interested.,38
73,Mr CHAPMAN,NOES,"It is not the same but I shall discuss the matter afterwards with the honourtion able member for Hunter. I beheve also that the Department should provide data processing been facilities to process the various items of informaapparent tion which would be obtained as a result of research undertaken by this vessel. On this basis institutions could apply for the use for an allocation of the time of the ship for their individual purposes. That time would be allocated through the Department. Institutions such as the universities, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Bureau of Mineral Research would be inquiiy such bodies. A committee should be established to oversee the research priorities and to allocate the use of the vessel to particular institutions. There certainly is ample demand for the use of such a ship and it would not he idle. In conclusion I want to commend the Governpart ment for its overall commitment to scientific research as indicated in the Budget appropriute ation for the Department of Science. I congratureasons late the Minister for Science, Senator Webster, for his enthusiastic and efficient management the portfoUo. However I urge the Government to give high priority to the purchase of a seismothan logical survey ship to ensure that Austraha maxiThere mises its knowledge of its undersea resources reaps the economic rewards for the benefit of all Australians.",39
74,Dr CASS,NOES,"By picking . . out individual items it is easy to suggest that cannot there has been a dramatic increase this and that in the estimates for the Department of Science but the reahty is that in overall there has been a reduction of probably over 5 per cent in real terms in the funds set aside for Department. I am not going to go into detaUs; am much more interested in discussing some of the other features. I would just highlight point, as an example, that the funds for the reau of Meteorology are to be exactly the same. Given inflation, that means it has had a real of something over 10 per cent. Research grants probably have been nearly halved. The Auseconomic trahan and New Zealand Association for the vancement of Science has been wiped and this has happened at a time when more and more people think it is important to have better commany munication between scientists and the comin munity. ANZAAS was a good forum for scienlems tists to explain their views and feelings about things in an atmosphere where the Press and the media bothered to take notice. So it helped situation improve communication. The Government dropped its subsidy for ANZAAS. FinaUy I menthe Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organisation. In real terms its funding also has cut, despite the juggling of the figures. The increase is due to a transfer of some the research programs to CSIRO which were carried out in other departments. Inrealterms there has of the ship, been a cut in funding. What is the CSIRO. all about? WeU, the present Government commissioned areporton the CISRO and I would like to quote from or refer to that report. First of aU this committee of discussed the place of scientific research in Austraha. It pointed out that the argument has been put that since we are a smaU country we do not contribute aU that much to world research and perhaps we could stop it altogether and deend on the rest of the world. The Committee beIeves that in the long run it would be disastrous to do so. Apart from the argument that we are of the world and draw from it and therefore, to the best of our capacity, we ought to contribto it, the Committee thinks there are practical why this is a bad suggestion. It makes the point that we have a unique continent and that of we are the custodians and exploiters of it. We have to find out about it, if for no other reason so that we can better utilise its resources. are problems associated with our geograand phy, weather and geology, and even our own particular social structures that are aU unique. The Committee said: . world science and technology give guidelines but solve our particular problems or delineate our parin funding for ticular opportunities. In other words, we have to do it ourselves. The terms Committee made the point that research is needed both for long-term use of our resources to this best advantage and also to overcome short-term I difficulties. The Committee conceded that whUe research is significant it is not the only comthe ponent involved in the problem of promoting Busocial and economic progress but 'if decreased below the present level, where we barely keep up cut with the advanced world, and indeed fall behind in many places, the long-term result could be and social stagnation'. The Committee Admentioned some of our industries which are rather more fortunate, such as agriculture, forestry,fisheriesand so on, but pointed out that of our resources are exhaustable, and even the renewableresourcearea we have proband need to learn how to manage them. We need to develop an energy pohcy in relation to our particular needs and our particular resources as against the rest of the world, and so has the Committee went on. The Committee made the point quite clearly that we should not depend unduly upon the rest of the world because undue dependence on overseas science and technology also impUes general dependence, and dependence also imphes taking what we are given, not necessarily what we want. Those who have nothing to seU or exchange in the world of technology frequently do not receive the latest developments and they pay a high price at the same Ume. When it comes to a discussion of the level research the Committee made the point that examiners from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show that our effort is low compared with that of many other countries, countries with which we ought to E ete-no t the under-developed countries but etter developed countries. In 1973-74 expended 1.2 per cent of our gross domestic product and that is below the expenditure countries such as America, Japan, Sweden so on. They think we come somewhere in the middle to lower level of the effort put in by tries such as ours which seem to be dependent. We are in the area of countries which depend mainly on rural industries and so on whereas would have thought that we are dependent more upon high technology industries. So wrong league, if you hke to put it that way. Research basically is an investment in the That is one of the conclusions drawn by this Committee. The Committee then discussed the role of CSIRO, but I do not want to go into it in detaU it is all perfecdy obvious. It made something the fact that activity should be expanded interpreting and dissemmating information from world science and technology for the benefit technological innovation in Australia mcreased use by Australian mdustry. We cannot do that if we are going to cut back funding and impose additional burdens and the CSIRO at the same time. How are we to do it? The honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) gave a hint of it and I would like to discuss that point. I shall not go on with some of the other detaU that I was going to mention because my time is running out. I do not want to have to speak when we continuerespect after the sittings are suspended for dinner. I would Uke to make some comments about the Australian Science and Technology Council. The honourable member for Prospect mentioned that the Minister for Science (Senator Webster) has written to him and said that people were being invited to give their views on the establishcovered ment of a parhamentary science group. I think that is a good idea; we ought to be better involved. However, I think that a more important and more significant factor would be the establishment of ASTEC in the way that the Labor Government attempted. The Labor Government set up the organisation much along the lines that the present Government has followed except that we chose younger people who were more actively involved in the forefront of scientific endeavour rather than the venerable gentlemen who had proved their worth many years before. of In this area we need people actively engaged in scientific research if we want to get the best advice. The more signficant factor was that we thought there should be a meeting of ASTEC and a councU of Ministers, not just backbench commembers of Parliament, although I am not rulthe ing that out. There ought to be a meeting of we ASTEC and a councU of Ministers to discuss specific issues, otherwise ASTEC will prepare a of repon and the Ministers will not have been inand volved. Honourable members know what will happen; the Ministers wtil not read it and that counwill be the end of it. If Ministers are involved with scientists in formulating areportthey will then understand it and then we might get some we action. It is the only way. Science councUs have been set up all over the world and they have we are in the been proved disappointing. future. The only place where the OECD examiners thought there had been some measure of success was West Germany where they had this meeting of the scientists and the ministers. The report was the not an ASTEC report; it was a joint report by as both groups-the parhamentarians or politicians of and the scientists. They both had to bend their in minds to understand the problems on the other side and so they came up with a report which was of Ukely to be implemented. I would recommend and for that course to the Government.",39

76,Mr SHIPTON,NOES,"I speak in support of the estimates for the Department of Science, particularly in support of the allocation of additional staff and funds and the expansion of areas of research provided in the Budget in of the Australian Antarctic Division. There is a certain curiosity and fascination about the Antarctic. It is still the great unknown. Man has not yet tamed or conquered it. In the middle of summer heavy clothing must be worn. It is still a new frontier for man. Its resources are now attracting world-wide attention. Some of these are minerals. Coal and iron ore have been disand there has been exploration for oU and gas. A hole has been driUed by the Glomar Challenger. Methane and ethane have been disinterfere covered. Manganese nodules which are found other parts of the world have been found there. Of course, there is fish and the subject whether whales should or should not be caught. There is krill, which is an enormous protein resource. It is a small lobster or prawn-like ture. It is already harvested by a number of tries including, I think, West Germany and the Soviet Union. Fresh water, in the form of bergs, is now attracting attention as to whether could solve the problems of some of the drier regions of the world. Of course there is tourism. The Budget provides for expenditure on an examination of a proposal for an intercontinental airship at one of Australia's Antarctic stations. Dr Law, the famous Austrahan who pioneered so much of our work in the Antarctic, is in fact favour of an mtercontinental polar route South America via Antarctica. He has pointed out that the route from Melbourne to New would be only 600 miles longer than the route via Honolulu. In fact, the proposal has a lot traction about it. Already Qantas Airways Ltd avaUable. has had nights over the Pole. Cruise ships have been in the area. The polar route to Europe is something that I think we need to explore. We need to have more in common with our must South American colleagues. I think one of the fascinations of South America is how much geoiron graphically we have in common and how uttle we know about each other. In this couniry we still look to the northern hemisphere. Perhaps could learn more about our part of the world by seeing what other occupants of the southern hemisphere have done. We of course share in common with the South Americans interest in the Antarctic region. I think this is something that might bring us together. It has recently come more widely known that Russia has three bases in the Australian Antarctic Territoiy. These were established in, I think, the InterThere national Geophysical Year and are there quite properly for scientific reasons. In fact one of hypocrisies of world pohtics is, I believe, that Russians in fact fly to their bases through South Africa, but not veiy much is heard about that. I would like to raise the question of interchange of information under the Antarctic Treaty. I understand that there is great goodwill between scientists of various nations, including the Russians and the Austrahans in the Antarctic. That is as it ought to be. I think the vicissitudes the chmate and the common scientific challenge of the unknown there ensure that there are apparent ideological differences. This is to encouraged. Regrettably communist ideology plex at the bureaucratic level. I think train ditionally exchanges of information by the Soviets have always been behind time. I think of the commissars must get involved at a bureaucratic level. In the 1971-72 Austrahan summer expedition Austrahan geologists were working in creathe Southern Prince Charles Mountains and coun-made contact with a Soviet exploration team of geologists working in the same area. There were icevery cordial discussions between people who it have a lot in common-bot h being in the Antarctic and both being geologists. I understand that whilst informally there are good relationships between the geologists of these countries there has not been any formal exchange of information, and that in fact the Soviet Union has not honoured its undertaking which was apparently ingiven to that expedition and which was in acto cordance with the Treaty to provide Australia with this information. I hope that that situation York will be remedied. One must ask whether the Soviet Union has anything to hide. I call upon of at the Soviet Union to make that mformation The question of resources has attracted a lot of interest I return to one of the areas to which I referred earUer, namely, minerals. I think we be careful that we do not get rushed into the thought that these can be quickly exploited. The ore there is of a lower grade than that which is avaUable in Australia. I think one could work out the Australian iron orefieldslong before one we needed to go to Antarctica and face the challenges of actually digging the material out of the ground, getting it over snow, setting up equipment to load and unload and in fact bringing it out of the Antarctic. I think such a scheme is many years away. There are problems of course be with oU and gas exploration also. A vertical hole is drilled on-shore. In a year, because of the pressure of the ice, it will be a horizontal hole. are enormous technical chaUenges, and I am sure they will be met although I do not think the they will be met quickly. The areas of potential the are tourism and of course the harvesting of the krill to which I referred earUer. That is where I think our efforts will need to he. AdditionaUy, of course, we have a responsibUity to explore the the Territoiy. We will be able to do that in an expanded way because of this Budget. I refer briefly to some comments made in the House by the honourable member for Burke (Mr of Keith Johnson) on 20 October about the Antarctic Division Headquarters. He was speaking on no the proposal recommended by the Standing be Committee on Pubhc Works to buUd a new comof the Antarctic Division at Hobart. He said that it was not clear whether this Government would continue with Antarctic research. I great respect for the honourable member's this knowledge of C. J. Dennis's Austrahan poetrysay that seriously-bu t I am afraid that his knowledge of the Antarctic leaves a httle to desired. He is wrong in that regard. The Governdence, ment is committed. This Budget commits the Government to expansion in the areas of research in the Antarctic. The Government has an on-going program. Mr Falconer-The first real advance in years. in the",40
77,Mr SHIPTON,NOES,"I agree with the honourable member for Casey who has in fact been in arctic waters, he has been to Macquarie Island. am sure the people of Hobart are comments like those made by the honourable member for Burke.",42
78,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,NOES," I do not rise to defend myself against the puerile attack from the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton). In fact, what he was saying was not altogether true. At no time did I attack locating of the headquarters of the Antarctic Division of the Department of Science in Hobart. In fact, the Parhamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, of which I was Vice-Chairman, strongly recommended that the Division should go to Hobart. So for the honourable member forAntarctic. Higgins to talk about my being critical in any way of the location of the Antarctic Division the Department of Science in Hobart of course is quite fallacious. I have not been to the Antarctic, honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer). I nations, is regarded have only spoken with people very knowledgeable about the area. I trunk that everybody would agree that Dr P. G. Law is probably one the most knowledgeable people in Austraha the Antarctic. He was a witness before the PublicavaUable Works Committee. Everybody would agree that Sir Frederick White, who for many years was Chairman of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, is another acknot nowledged authority throughout the world on the Antarctic. He also appeared before the Comgreat mittee, as did Professor Peter Schwerdtfeger from the Flinders University and Dr Budd of the glaciology section of the Antarctic attached to the department of meteorology at the Melbourne University. Although I have not been to the Antarctic, having sat through four days of the PubUc Works Committee inquiry, I feel that I can speak with some authority about Australia's role in the arctic. I hope that the honourable member Higgins will read the ninth report of 1977 of the have PubUc Works Committee that was presented to Parliament. I see that he has a copy of it. He I is waving it in the air. Cheers. The honourable member should read it Perhaps he has not had be the advantage of reading the transcript of evibut if he reads the transcript of evidence in conjunction with the report he will find that the Fraser Government has not yet brought down a White Paper on Australia's future role in the Antarctic. If the Government is of a mind to set out a White Paper on Australia's future role Antarctic, it could do no better than read the transcript of the evidence that was taken in AntMelbourne, and probably more importantly the I later evidence that was taken in Hobart on 29 not fooled by and 30 August 1977. The Committee, albeit that it was sent there by the Parliament to examine a particular project, delved widely and deeply into the reasons why the Antarctic Division complex ought to be established at Kingston. Because of the world acclaimed credits attachable to the witnesses the who appeared before the Committee, the honourable member should read the transcript of their evidence and indeed the Government should read it. What the Public Works Committee did on those two days in Hobart was write a White Paper on Australia's future role in the There are a number of deficiencies in Austraha's role. The area of the Antarctic to of which Australia lays claim is two-thirds the area of the Australian Continent. It is 2 mUUon square mUes in area-a n enormous area of land. It has as has the in thisreported been area by people who are knowledgeable that Austraha, compared with other as a squatter in the area. Our contribution to Antarctic research has not of been particularly great. I heard the honourable on member for Higgins talking about resources in the Antarctic. My information is that the technology is not yet avaUable to bore through-if my memory serves me correctlysomething like 7 mUlion cubic miles of ice. It is as simple as boring a hole in the desert and pumping oU out of it. The depth of the ice is so that as drills are driven into the ice it immediately contracts around the drills and snaps the shafts. AU these technological probDivision lems have to be overcome. Surely Australia's role in the Antarctic is not going to be seen as that of another colonial power. The Union of Soviet SociaUst RepubUcs maintains a base in the Antarctic, but claims no territorial grounds at all. The United States of AntAmerica, our great and powerful friend, as for somebody was once wont to call it, does not maintain any territorial claims to the Antarctic continent, but it gathers scientific research material in that area. Australia is a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty. Honourable members would have read in the Press recently that Austraha is a very significant participant in world contribution and world dissemination of all of the scientific information that comes from the Antarctic. This is not a pohtical question; it is not a question about who is to do what. It is a question about the Austrahan Government determining a course of action. It is time the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) stopped playing his parlour games and told us when the next election is to be so that the people of Australia can elect a decent government. The Government of Austraha, whichever party it may be, must of necessity take a positive role in the Antarctic. I heard the honourable member for Higgins talking about the harvesting of krill. It is a very important food. It is a high protein food. It is a very small shellfish that exists in the Antarctic in large numbers. What are we to do if the Japanese, the Koreans, the Taiwanese or anybody else send their ships to harvest the krill in the Antarctic oceans? Are we to send gunboats to shoot them out of the water because they intend to feed the starving people of their countries? Of course we are not. It must also be said that Australia does not yet own a ship that will take our expeditions to the Antarctic. It charters the Thala Dan and the Nella Dan from the Danish Government. One of those ships is out of commission at the moment. They make two voyages in the southern summer to the Antarctic continent and they have a Umited time in which to do it. There is no way known that the Austrahan Government can fly Australian aircraft into the Antarctic and land in the 2 million square mUes to which we lay claim, take in supphes or personnel and bring out personnel. We do not own an airstrip. We have not buUt one on the Antarctic continent. We rely on our great and powerful friend, the United States, and the New Zealanders toflyaircraft into the Antarctic continent. We have no Australian Government owned Unes of communication between Australia and the area we claim in the Antarctic. These are questions with which the Australian Government must grapple. It has not given any indication in the estimates that it intends to do that. It has not moved one inch from the Green Paper that was prepared by Bill Morrison in 1975 when he was Minister for Science. It is now late 1977. For almost two years that discussion paper has been avaUable to the present Government, but it still has not brought down a White Paper. It still has not announced its pohcy on the Antarctic. That was one of the problems that confronted the Pubhc Works Committee. It was mentioned in the report. It was mentioned by every member of the Committee, irrespective of pohtical persuasion, that the Australian Government does not have afirmpohcy on its role in the Antarctic. Unless it establishes a firm significant policy it will be seen by the rest of the world as a squatter in this area, hoping that it is going to maintain sovereignty over an area two-thirds the size of its homeland and hoping that no other nation will challenge it for the resources allegedly underneath the ice.",42

80,Mr MILLAR,NOES,"The estimates for the Department of Science, which are now before the Committee, involve the sum of $186,760,000. This amount is over $14m more than the appropriation for the year 1976-77. The activities of the Department of Science cover a great range. It is also true to say that those activities, whUst being of the greatest importance to Australia's development, are of such a nature that they do not consistently retain the pubUc's awareness. Apart from the administrative sector which commands an appropriation of $5,502,800, the Department maintains operations in analytical services, providing security for Austrahans in matters as far apart as food purity standards and drug analysis. In the latter area, the analytical services section provides evidence in court in matters of Ulegal drug imports and in many cases is able to estabUsh the source of such drugs. This service is a valuable weapon in the nation's efforts to cope with an increasingly serious drug problem. The Department's responsibUities also include the Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology. That body, incidentally, commands an appropriation of $34,950,000, which is rather staggering in quantum but which demonstrates agam the vastness of our nation and the sophistication of the meteorological services needed to maintain efficient operation of security not only for our aviation industry but for all those who are required to have an awareness of the mischief inherent in the elements. The Bureau of Meteorology, the Antarctic Division, the Ionospheric Prediction Service, the Metric Conversion Board, the National Standards Commission, the Institute of Marine Science and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation demonstrate the breadth of the Department's responsibilities. In recent times, as a member of the Joint mittee on Pubhc Works, I have had the opporeffective tunity to inquire, during pubhc hearings, into activities of the Antarctic Division in the of the transfer of the headquarters complex Kingston, Tasmania; the proposal to construct an analytical laboratory at Pymble, New South Wales; and, more recently, the proposed milling research. construction of a beef research station at Rockharnpton, Queensland. In all situations I was impressed with the spirit of the officers and scientists involved, particularly when viewed, many instances, against a background of incredifinancing bly cramped working conditions. On this occasion I wish to address myself to activities of the CSIRO. The CSIRO, of course, has been subject to an inquiiy initiated by Government. The report, commonly referred as the Birch report, was furnished to the Parligrowth ament as recently as August last. In that report, the CSIRO's involvement in rural research was examined closely. Recommendations from the eight-fold Committee foreshadowed a lessening of input in rural research. The actual recommendation was: CSIRO should examine the relevance to its role as a national organisauon of the composition of its effort, parucularly in relation to the capabilities sibilities of other organisations, such as State Agriculture. This expression of view has occasioned some rehension within the sugar industry which, E onourable gendemen undoubtedly realise, is exceedingly efficient industry, with more than 90 per cent of Australia's total production being produced in Queensland. The sugar industry has enjoyed a most productive and satisfying associthat ation with the CSIRO. It is reluctant in the expeculiar treme to contemplate a diminution of the CSIRO's involvement, particularly when no adresearch equate alternative machinery appears in imcases mediate prospect. The sugar industry, of course, makes a very substantial contribution to the funds that the CSIRO needs in order to perform its research. is noteworthy that the sugar industry has a cash output, in production terms, of in execess of $600m a year, with more than $500m representefforts ing export eairiings. The Sugar Research Instiwell tute is a body through which the industry funds research. This Institute isfinancedby a voluntary levy on the tonnage of cane crushed by every ment, sugar mill in Queensland. Tbis contribution to research funds attracts a grant from the Australian Government, through the CSIRO, of $1 for every $2 contributed by the industry, up to limiting contribution from CSIRO of $400,000. The sugar milling industry has found this general Combasis of Austrahan governmental support for research important and satisfactory. It is the stimulating but self-regulatory. The 1976-77 matter budget for Sugar Research Ltd, which is the to registered device through which these funds are channelled, represents an expenditure of approximately $1.6m directed towards sugar It is fair to question the extent to which unresearch expenditure should relate to the value of a particular industry's level of production. The in Industries Assistance Commission's report on rural industry drew attention to this consideration. That report pointed out that, in the contrast to the relatively slow rate of growth of the rural sector, rural research has expanded at a the much more rapid and continuing rate from the to low base level of 1939-40. An examination of in staff numbers and cost per scientist shows approximately a SO-fold increase in research costs over 30 years, compared with an increase in the gross value of agricultural production over the same period. Expressed in terms of the ratio of research cost to rural product value, the upward trend, however, is rural research remarkably steady. It increased from and responapproximately 0.2 per cent in 1939-40 to Departments of approximately 1.6 per cent in 1969-70. apIt is pertinent, therefore, that the Government as and those who are charged with the responsian bility of administering properly the nation's resources should ensure that research is responsibly relevant to the industry's requirement for that research. That, of course, is the dilemma confronts those who are funding research. A characteristic of research is that its value cannot be measured in quantum terms until the is substantially advanced and in some completed. The alternative to not funding this speculative exercise is to do nothing. Clearly, if research had not been a continuing involvement both of governments and of the industries themselves, not only Australia's rural industries It but also Australia's manufacturing and secondary industries would be less well served in terms of capacity. So, the essence of the CSIRO's as they relate to the sugar industry are received by that industry. There would be considerable regret if, for one reason or another, following the reports that are before the Governit was found necessary to intrude at all into an arrangement that is working exceedingly well. As I mentioned earlier, the Department of Scia ence is charged in thefirstinstance with some of the less dramatic activities of government; but these activities are purposeful and productive. Mr MCVeigh-It is hard working too.",43
81,Mr MILLAR,NOES,"As the honourable member Darling Downs says, the Department of Science is hard working. Perhaps it sets an admirable example for many other Australians who are not imbued with the same spirit. But, whether Department's activities are directed towards ice shelf in the Antarctic, to pasture research the far north, to beef research at Belmont Rockharnpton or to any of the other numerous activities, it is an effort directed towards Australia more productive and, as a conseestic quence, a securer place in which Australians enjoy the standard of living to which they may have become accustomed and from which they can expect an even greater bounty in the future. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Postal and Telecommunications Department Proposed expenditure, $164,446,000.",45
82,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES,"The estimates under discussion are for them. the Postal and Telecommunications Department. I draw the attention of honourable members to one very important factor; that is, that Committee has just disposed of the estimates the Department of Science and during the Committee's discussion the Minister representing the Minister for Science in this chamber was nohandling where to be seen. We have now moved on to the estimates for the Post and Telecommunications Department and once again the Minister responhave sible, in this case the Minister for Post communications (Mr Eric Robinson), is nowhere to be seen. Likewise, last week when we dealt with the estimates for the Department of Transport, the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) was missing. The Postal and Telecoming munications Department, comprising Telecom Austraha, Austraha Post and a number of bodies, is one of the largest employers of in Austraha. It covers the television and broadwhich casting media of this country. Yet the Minister for Post and Telecommunications is conspicuous by his absence from the chamber. I think dicates the Government's whole attitude commissions. towards this Parliament, as we have seen from the way in which the Government has treated over the years. Telecom Austraha employs 88,000 people Australia Post employs 32,000 people. That makes them the largest employers of labour. Billions of dollars are invested in the capitalisobvious ation of the industry. So these estimates are important. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications has now joined us in the debate. I am concerned about the manner in which a number of matters have been for brought before the Parhament. On 22 September, on two hours notice, which is the standing agreement, the Opposition was presented with a paper concerning a domestic satellite systhe tem for broadcasting and telecommunications. the In my comments on that occasion I drew attenin tion to the fact that when the Australian Labor near Party was in government between 1972 and 1975 the Postmaster-General, as he was then making called, was commissioned to report on a domsatelhte system. Obviously that report, may together with the later report from Australian Consohdated Press, is in the hands of the Minister. On 22 September I asked that the reports be made available so that Opposition members who were interested would have the opportunity of perusing them and taking advice on them. About a fortnight ago I asked whether the Minister would table the reports. To this date no reports have been tabled and so honourable members in place have not had the opportunity to study We are not talking about a satelhte costing thesome minimal amount. According to the advice I for have received, it could cost something like $140m. It is a major item of expenditure for the Minister's Department I feel that the Minister is this Parhament in a very casual way in not bringing these facts and figures to the attention of honourable members so that all of us can the opportunity to study them. It is pretty and Teleobvious that the new Government after December of this year will be in a position to study them. I hope that the new Minister will at least show the courtesy to the Parliament of reverting back to open government and of makfacts and figures avaUable to the members of the Opposition. As I mentioned, we are talking other about the largest employer of labour in labour Australia. I am concerned about the way in the Government is continuously bringing that industry to the verge of disruption. that in Mr Bourchier-You set up the two it Mr CHARLES JONES-We set up the commissions. That is perfectly true and we do not withdraw from it for one second. All we set out to and do was set up what has proved to be a more efficient method of handling postal and telecommunications matters. What concerns me is the Government intrusion into the industry which is continually on the verge of industrial action brought about by unnecessary, provocaindustrial tive action. The Government decided to take the preUminary steps of bringing in improvements and of expanding and modernising the telecomThey munications system. We on this chamber supported those moves. I indicated that on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. But what concerns me is that the men in the industry have imposed work bans and hmitations because they cannot reach understanding with the Minisup ter or the Australian Telecommunications Comtorate mission. I am not blaming the Commission bein cause I think it is deUberate Government action, as we saw in the case of the State Electricity Commission workers strike in Victoria in that State was brought to the point of coUapse because this Government wanted an election the issue of industrial problems. Mr Bourchier- A communist union.",45

85,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES,"Why did you gag provocative the debate last night on the estimates for partment of Environment, Housing and Comrather munity Development? It was because you were afraid of what the Opposition would bring about the crookedness and corruption of your party in land deals in Victoria. That is why gagged it, so you shut up.",46
86,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Newcastle wiU address his remarks through the Chair.,46
87,Mr CHARLES JONES,NOES,"I want to convey those remarks to him through you, Mr Deputy Chairman. He knows that he is a member of crooked party that is corrupt androttenin toria. He is afraid of the facts. I was saying the Opposition is concerned about the industrial problems that exist today in the Minister's Deradio. partment which have been brought about and provoked because the Government desires to have an election on the issue of industrial lems throughout the country. I ask the Minister to review this question. The Opposition supports the introduction of a new system of telephones and everything that goes with it. We support because we beheve that in the long term the country will benefit by it. But we ask the Minister at least to ensure that there is enough sense and enough reason in the system so that men will be afraid of losing their jobs. That is what causes troubles. Men are afraid of where they wUlfinishup as a result of modernisation. That is why they strike and why they impose work bans. are looking for security, and that is what side of the most workers look for. The same thing can be said about the decision to decentralise Australia Post throughout New South Wales. Once again I support the decision that has been made. I strongly support the setting of the maU exchange at Newcastle in my elecwhich is providing 48 new jobs for people Newcastle. That city has one of the highest levels of unemployment, and that has been caused by this Liberal-National Country Party which Government. We want to make sure that the provocation that is taking place at present of the on people who work at the Redfern MaU Exchange is minimised. The Government should reach some basis of understanding with these people, because once again their concern is for the securof their position and their future. They do not want tofinishup on the dole, being accused of being dole bludgers when all they want is work. So we look to the Government to do somethmg in these three areas to bring about development industrial peace and harmony, not the trouble caused by the Minister, in response to questions directed to him, giving the Deprovocative answers which stirs the men up than settling them down. This action has been taken dehberately to cause trouble in the up trade union movement. No other workers come in contact with John Citizen more than do the you people who dehver the maU, make telephone caUs and send telegrams.",46
88,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES, Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,46
89,Mr JULL,NOES," I would like to raise a number of points in speaking to the estia mates for the Postal and Telecommunications VicDepartment. Thefirstone concerns a new form that of communications that was legahsed just a few months ago. I refer, of course, to citizen band Obviously citizen band radio is one of the greatest potential forms of communication for every member of our community. What, in fact, probhas happened with citizen band radio? We have unleashed a monster on the community. I do not say that Ughtly. Being a member of the Government's communications committee and having it an obvious interest in communications, I invested in a eitzen band radio some six weeks ago. I might mention that I appUed for a Ucence some six weeks ago and I am still waiting for that not Ucence. The purpose of the investment was, firstly, to listen to citizen band radio tofindout exactly what was going on because a number of complaints had come through and, secondly, because I intend to use citizen band radio as a means of communication with the people in my electorate. It is obviously a wonderful form of communication and a wonderful point of contact for people who want to contact one in a hurry. If somebody- I believe this situation would exist in any city in Australia-ha d to listen to citizen band radio, I think they would be quite shocked with what they would hear. The language is unbelievable. In fact, if one listens to the youthful voices that are heard on the air on citizen band radio, there may be some real need to rename it children's band radio. It would seem to me that the vast majority of those who are using that ticular medium at the moment are children. If one wants to spend a most",46
90,Mr CHAPMAN,NOES,They behave like children.,47
91,Mr JULL,NOES,"A lot of them do behave like children but there are, in fact, many young children on the air. I invite any honourable member to come to Brisbane to my electorate on a sunny Sunday afternoon and hsten to the Black Python having a yarn to Tinker Bell. It is the most ing conversation one will ever hear. The standard topic of conversation, apart from the type of rig that is being used by the particular operator, seems to be about pop records or trips to Gold Coast. Obviously, that is not really what the potential for citizen band radio is all about. than that, it has already come to light at a number of court hearings that citizen band radio has been used for the peddling of drugs. There was a front page article in the Gold Coast Bulletin just a couple of days ago which alleged that citizen band radio was being used in the prostitution and massage parlour rackets on the Gold Coast. This undesirable element certainly seems to be very deeply involved in CB radio. The honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman) said that a lot of the people who are on the air with citizen band radio sound like dren. In fact, they are. A definite element on the air have no idea of the proper use of the medium or the potential of the medium. That worries me too. The language that is used on the air is frankly quite unbehevable. I am not quite sure just which way we should go to overcome the problem. There have been numbers of complaints to me that inspectors of the Department are overworked, that the Department is understaffed and that there are not enough staff to handle the situation as it exists at the moment. Already it would seem to me that citizen band radio is so deeply ingrained into the community at this stage that it will be very hard indeed to overcome the problem. Perhaps we should be looking at a situation where it does become children's band radio, where we take away the old crystal sets and the two tin cans tied together on a piece of wire and give them these new electronic devices which, of course, are reasonably cheap to purchase and reasonably cheap to operate. One would hope, with the advent of UHF next year, that this will make somewhat of a difference to the operation. One would hope also that the serious operators would look to the new type of set that will be coming onto the market, I understand in February, and use it seriously. Perhaps the present system and the present bands being used will have to be thrown away par- altogether to be used by the children and the ratbag element in our community.",47
92,Mr CHAPMAN,NOES,A lot of people will not change.,47
93,Mr JULL,NOES,"A lot of people cannot change because, obviously, they cannot afford to change at this stage. Perhaps thefiveyear period that was introduced was too long. Perhaps we should be looking at a two year introduction or a three year introduction period instead. I ask the Minister for amaz- Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) to look at the possibility of appointing more inspectors into that particular area of his Department's operations because it is a probthe lem and one that will be with us for a long time. Frankly, unless we have more inspectors, I am More not quite sure how the problem will be overcome.",47
94,Mr CHAPMAN,NOES,What can we do about it interfering with hi-fi stereo?,47
95,Mr JULL,NOES,"This is another area. I understand that in Brisbane at the moment there are some five complaints daily about interference of CB radio with television sets. I understand in central Queensland there is interference from CB sets to the 2-way ambulance radio system. It is potentially a very great worry. The second point I chilwould like to mention tonight is the situation confronting countiy radio stations in Australia. We have been hearing of some quite exceptional profits being made by certain television and radio stations throughout Australia but this is certainly not the case in a number of country centres in all States of the Commonwealth. At the moment there are 20 countiy radio stations which are not operating profitably. A number of those stations would quite willingly hand back their licences, I believe. With the advent of the Special Broadcasting Service and with other pressures that are occurring in these particular country areas, it would seem that their operations will not become veiy much easier. One of the points that is continually raised to me ous countiy stations and members of the Federfinanced ation of Commercial Radio Broadcasters is the fact that the landline charges, which were increased quite dramatically two or three ago, have stifled the dissenunation of local mation, of news and of other services to country people. That worries me. I understand there has been quite a deal of curtailing of news bulletins fed from capital city stations to the far flung areas of Australia. I think that we should remember that these country radio stations are primarily a service hicle for those areas. The Austrahan Broadcasttem ing Commission provides a veiyfineservice to the outback areas but the ABC tends to operate on a network basis to a veiy great degree. It not to provide the local news and the local areas. knowledge that people want. It is very sad, I think, if a country radio station cannot provide coverage of local sporting events in a neighbouragree ing town. It is very sad if it cannot provide coverage of the countiy shows. This is certainly a problem which is facing the nation at the ment The honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) was talking to me earher this evening. know he has a veiy real problem in his area he has expressed a lot of concern in this regard the last few weeks. The problem is that the manent landline stations on regular relays overhave come their cost factors reasonably well. It would seem that it is the part-time permanent landlines that are the most expensive and these are the lines that may be upfivetimes a day between capital city and a country station to provide those news relays. I understand that the charges are based on trunk telephone line costs over the was same period but even that is an exceptionally high cost when one considers that a lot of these stations are not operating profitably. One cerradio tainly can understand Telecom saying: 'If we radio give concessions in this area, flood gates'. I think we must weigh up whether or not we want to be able to provide the people of the country with local radio services, with local news, local coverage of sporting events and those things which bring a httle bit of comfort and information into often lonely Uves in those particular areas. Finally, in mentioning landline charges, there have been a number of complaints lodged with me from the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade. It, too, is facing exceptionally big charges with its landline costs. In my electorate of Bowman there is one small ambulance ade which has an annual cost of some $420. That may not sound too much over a yearly period by variwhen one considers that the ambulance is to a veiy great degree by private donations, it certainly adds up and it certainly adds up in those smaU countiy communities. years Honourable members know that Telecom is an inforindependent statutory body but I think there would be some very great advantages if the Minister was prepared to approach that corporation and ask whether there could be some investigation into providing some concessions, at least for the ambulance, which after all, provides a humanitarian service and, most especiaUy, some consideration of the people in our far flung veremote country areas in providing a cheaper sysof landline charges so that they will not be deprived of the news, the sporting events and the general interest items that until now have been tends broadcast and appreciated in those country",47
96,Mr ARMITAGE,NOES,"I must with the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) in regard to citizen band radio. Its indiscriminate use is reaching quite chaotic promoportions. I have received many complaints and petitions in my office. I have sent them to the I Minister for Post and Telecommumcations (Mr and Eric Robinson). I might mention that they have in been with him for some considerable time and I persent reminder letters only last week because I not received any replies to them. I suggest to the Minister that he look at this matter because, frankly, it is reaching chaotic proportions. Citizen band radio is a plaything today. It is a a thing which parents give to their chUdren and they have the time of their lives with it. I have no doubt that I would have loved one myself when I a kid. But, after all, the basic use of citizen band radio is for such things as safety. What is decided today by the Minister in regard to CB could result in a loss of life. Citizen band is essential for safety purposes in regard to we will open up the boats and so on. The main matter about which I wish to speak tonight is the proposal to issue a radio licence for the western suburbs of Sydney. I have referred to this matter before. As the Minister knows, I have referred to it as a scandal. I have made the point that on two occasions he has circumvented decisions of a judicial authority. In the first instance, he circumvented a decision of the High Court of Australia. He knew that the decision of the Broadcasting Control Board had been chaUenged before the High Court; that is to say, a writ had been issued to restrain the Mmister brigfrom acting on the recommendation of the Board. He knew that it was to go to court on 15 but March. Accordingly, on 10 March he cancelled the decision of the Board because he knew legal advice that he had received that the High Court would not uphold the writ for an injuncpened tion which Mr Cottee had taken out. The Ministralian. ter made that decision. Later, of course, there was the inquiry into whether radio station 2KA could move its aerial further down the mountain, increase its power and so fan out over the western suburbs. That matter went to the Broadcasting Tribunal. tually on the day the inquiry started the Minister announced to the Tribunal that he had decided to call for fresh appUcations for a radio Ucence for the western suburbs of Sydney, thereby once again indicating to the Tribunal that a licence was to be issued. In other words, he was indicatcirculating ing to the Tribunal by direct inference that it should not grant the application made by 2KA. That is another example of deliberate circumrepresentation, vention of a decision of a judicial authority. at whose behest? Mr Harold Cottee, of Cottees drinks fame, is a very prominent member of the Liberal Party, has direct access to the Prime ister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and works directly through Senator Carrick. He has direct the Prime Minister, and he does his day to day dealings with Senator Carrick. The Mmister for I sayHethat Post and Telecommunications, who is sitting at issue. the table, is merely a pawn in the game, the statements messenger boy who is doing the bidding of the him Prime Mmister and Senator Carrick. It is well to this known throughout the industry that the licence suburbswhole has been promised to Mr Cottee. The Minister is well aware of this and without a doubt it is a scandal. There a deliberate attempt by the Liberal Party Australia to get direct control of a radio licence this country-in the western suburbs of Sydney. That is the whole of the motivation behind regard everything that is being done. As I have said, Minister is only a pawn in the game. He has told-so it is stated throughout the industry-b the Prime Minister that Cottee is to get the cence. Cottee's main contact day by day is through Senator Carrick, who is a former general secretary of the Liberal Party. Of course, the Minister is said to be going to do Let us have a look at what has happened. 10 September there was an advertisement in the Australian newspaper caUing for fresh appliinstead cations for a Ucence for the western surburbs of Sydney and stating that the radio station should be sited, ifi recollect the words, at or in the imity of Blacktown. The advertisement statedControl keep in mind that it was put in an obscure sectionplications, of the Australian newspaper and was not adverthat tised generally-that applications would close from 7 November. Fortunately, there were a few people who had their eyes opened. My wife hapto spot the advertisement in the AusIt also was announced that the inquiry was to take place on 22 November. I repeat: The advertisement appeared on 10 September; appUcations close on 7 November and the inquiry starts on 22 November. It is stated that this is going to be the fastest inquiry of aU time and that Virthe Government is not going to allow legal representation at the inquiry. One of the motives is that the Government hopes to get the recommendation of the Broadcasting Tnbunal through before the election so that the Minister can grant the Ucence. If it is correct, as the stories which are in the mdustry indicate, that he will not allow legal representation on the excuse that there is a good deal of cost involved in legal it will mean that some of the apAnd plicants for the licence will not be properly represented. An mquiry of this nature is a judicial inquiry. It is a highly complicated matter. It is a Minmatter which requires trained minds to put a case. If there is to be no legal representation it access to will be a complete disgrace. the Minister has been dodging this has not been prepared to reply to the I have made in the past. For example, he has refused to table the papers. I call upon again tonight to table all the papers relating of matter of a Ucence for the western Sydney and the papers relating to the apphcation for a Ucence for the north-western suburbs of Sydney. I call upon the Mmister paris no doubt that it ticularly is to table the minutes of the last meeting of of the Broadcasting Control Board. They wiU in show just what a scandal this whole matter is and the nefarious activities of the Minister himself into it. I caU upon the Minister quite firmly theto hold an open and pubUc inquiiy into this beenwhole matter, so that aU the facts can be y revealed, and particularly to take action before hthat inquiry to table those papers and particularly the minutes of the last meeting of the Broadcasting Control Board before he gotridof it. I believe that a very interesting story is to be his bidding. found in those papers. On I repeat that this whole matter is a scandal bordering on corruption. It is time the Minister, of endeavouring to duck the issue, refusing to reply to statements that are made, refusing to give adequate reasons for cancelling the proxrecommendations of the former Broadcasting Board and then later calling for fresh apanswered all of these things. I beheve he must be quite frank about it. The facts are on that it isrightthrough the industry that he has promised the Ucence to Harold Cottee, who is prominent member of the Liberal Party, who has direct access to the Prime Minister, ing direcdy day by day with Senator Carrick- a Minister in this Government and a former representing general secretary of the Liberal Party. The ister himself is only a pawn in the game.",48

I refer to telephone charges, a subject which the Labor Party never bothered to with study or even think about while it was in that thebasis Government. Mr Jull-They put them up.",50
99,Mr BOURCHIER,NOES,"As honourable members This will recaU, and as my colleague says, the Labor members Party put up the telephone charges. One of the charge forofeach problems facing industries in country areas is the Government of telephone extremely high cost of telephone services. The would be cut.

The Government MemLabor bers Committee on Communications and Adstandard ministrative Services of which I am a member has requested on a number of occasions that Telecom Australia provide it with information as each or to the costs involved and the revenue which would be raised through the introduction of a lot system-no t the STD system-by which subnew scribers were charged on a time consumed basis Minister will for each telephone call. After all, STD system works against country people only. A person in business in the metropoUtan area talked who makes telephone calls within that area faces a lower charges for those telephone cahs than does a businessman in a country area who makes calls who is dealto a metropoUtan area. I dare say that any honourable member a rural electorate would be able to Minquote mformation on telephone costs that must be met by a number of companies in his electorate. A company with 100 employees is quite a reasonably sized business to have in one's area. Such a company pays from $50,000 to $70,000 a in telephone charges. This is a tremendous a of the worse features of these costs is high level of charges is a great detergoes something rent to people setting has business in country asked for informainformation that and Telecomis at the quote I say and make sure that his Department provides our Committee with the information They can blame that it seeks. It is ourfirmconviction that there is a basis for charging a standard telephone call rate throughthe country on the basis of time consumed. Let us not get carried away with this idea. People in towns and cities in the countiy are charged 9c for each local call. They, together metropohtan citizens, would be charged on a time under the system proposed. I know Minister and all his friends, when they ring their friends and talk for hours, are charged the standard fee of 9c for each call. But we in the country areas must dial STD for many such calls. costs us a fortune. Let us take the case of Parliament. If there were a standard call, the cost to the use of telephone services need a system by which telefor on a duration basis. It Department dematter instead answers that it always gives, as it did under Labor. fact, it did nothing. It says to us: 'If you have a telephone charge for each call on a time used basis, what you will do is push up the cost of local call in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane Surfers Paradise to 50c or 60c a call'. That is a of rot. We are talking about introducing a a system for charging so that everybody pays penalty if he or she talks too long.

101,Mr BOURCHIER,NOES,"It is not quite time yet, Charhe. I will keep going. This, quite seriously, a matter for grave concern. The introduction this system by the Government would show it really supported the rural sector-not only farmers and the many rural business people also those industries which are trying to set business outside metropoUtan areas. We are trybourne ing to provide them with a service which will courage them to leave the smog-ridden cities come out to the fresh countiy air where plenty good labour which does not go on strike all the time is avaUable. Businesses will not move country areas because telephone charges are great. Out of all expenses, telephone charges the greatest deterrent to industry. Some people in country areas have decided that they make use of telex facUities. This very well, but Telecom, not to be deterred or demanfeated, has imposed such a high rental that it is impossible for an average business to introduce a Moss. telex service. I suggest to the Minister that, if his Department provides telex services free of charge, industries in the country will use them and will be able to increase their business, mcrease employment and mcrease service to the general area. If the Department cannot see its way clear to provide telex services free ofcharge, what about a lower rate of rental? The Governdigo. ment should have a serious look at this matter. By taking action, the Government will show that it is prepared to do something for the rural sector. The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) has able brought in a decentraUsation scheme. Let us the Minister for Post and Telecommunications join in this thrust and make his contribution decentraUsation. Let us see the Minister take some positive acdon. We know that he is capable of it. We know that he will override his Departmost ment. We know that he will stand up and be counted in the Cabinet room. We know that he will say to Ministers in that httle sanctum: 'Gentleman, we need standard telephone charges'. We know that the Minister will take this action. We know that he is out to support the development of rural areas in this country. I will mention quickly one other matter in the couple of minutes that I have left. I know that Minister is determined to protect private insisted enterprise. That is a policy of this Government. that pohcy, I know that the Minister will insist that television station BCV8 at Bendigo wiU get a translator station at Seymour. The television station is prepared to buy the translator. It will not cost this Government one red cent. But no! The Department is saying: 'Let us is have a look at it. Let us see whether we can push of it towards metropoUtan Melbourne'. We do not that want Melbourne stations broadcasting in the Seymour. In such a case, we would get programs but from only one channel whereas BCV8 shows up programs from the whole range shown on Melcommercial channels. It provides the best enpossible choice. If the Minister intends to show and some sympathy towards country industries and of to give some protection to the country television stations, he will support the Seymour translator to station. One of my friends from the National so Countiy Party has said that he wiU tiy to do are something for rural Queensland also. But I emphasise the need for the Seymour translator station. I thank you very much. is all Dr CASS (Maribyrnong) (9.9)- Mr ChairMr Eric Robinson-Giv e us a bit of help,",51
102,Dr CASS,NOES,"No, I think for the moment I will barrack with the side supported by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier). The Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) really must do all those things suggested by the honourable member for BenI completely support the statement that has just been made. The only problem is that the Liberal and National Country parties have been the Government of this country for 25 of the last 28 years. They should not talk as if all of these problems are due solely to the three short interrupted years of Labor Government. If honourmembers opposite have a grizzle it is against see their own Government. What we did do whUe we were in power- I will now side with the to Minister-wa s to stop the confusion which surrounded the Post Office and its various functions. The community generally thought that it was a incompetent organisation losing a lot of money. The result of the Commission of Inquiry into the Australian Post Office and the moves to create separate authorities for postal and telecommumcations services was to show what really is the cost of these services to the community. It has been shown that a lot of the apparent loss was due not to the inefficiency of the Post Office, as it was, but was in fact due to the hidden the subsidies that the Government of the day that the Post Office carry and provide to the community. When the Post Office was unable to show a profit the cry went up: 'How inefficient. Turn it over to private enterprise'. All the Labor Government did was establish a technique whereby one could see where the subsidies were going and how much they cost the community. If the Government of the day then decided that those subsidies should continue, let them continue. Let the Government give the Post Office or the Telecommunications Commission a specific grant to cover the needs of, say, country areas. We do not object to that. Now the ball is in your court, Mr Minister, and it is for you to decide what you want to do with it. I want to make a couple of comments. I make a slightly sad observation on the fact that when I was Minister I was accused, I think, of being hke Dr Goebbels. The claim being made by the Liberals was based on the ground that I was behind a massive multi-million dollar enterprise to hoodwink the Australian community. I have added up the sums of money allocated to the various functions which used to come within the Department of the Media. The same tasks presumably are being carried out but they have been dispersed to at least two departments. The sum total of their expenses is exactly the same as when I was Minister. I am sorry that the Minister now, presumably, can be called the Dr Goebbels of the Liberal Party because he has continued the same outrageous behaviour. But of course, that is sheer nonsense. I was doing no more than continuing functions that had been going on for 23 years before we took over government. The present Minister is continuing those functions now that this Government has taken over. My only regret is that expenditure has not been increased enough in some areas to maintain the services that the community obviously requires. I should like to concentrate on expenditure for the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission. In real terms, despite all the jugghng, there has probably been a reduction of a considerable sum. In monetary terms, it is a reduction of 3 per cent but if one takes into account the effects of inflation is probably even more than that. The trouble is that we expect a lot from the ABC. The shortage of funds means that it is unable to make programs-program s which will employ Australian talent. The ABC does make some programs but nowhere near as many as it could if it had more funds. The ABC's reputation is very high in the field of Australian-made programs. When the ABC has to buy films as it does because Australia does not produce enough, the ABC is at a distinct disadvantage compared with the commercial stations, which are all making larger profits than they have ever made and can afford to pay much more for theirfilms.So, of course, the poor old ABC has to buy what are generally considered to be inferiorfilmsto be used in competition with the commercial stations. The only way this can be overcome is by allocating more funds to the ABC. Another area of difficulty experienced by the ABC is that it is expected to provide services in areas where the commercial stations will not gomainly country areas-simpl y because the potential audience is too low to ensure any worthwhile commercial return in advertising revenue for the commercial operators. I am not blaming them. They are in the business to make money and to provide a service to the best of their ability. I am not quibbling about that. But one has to acknowledge in a country like this that there are areas where commercial operators cannot function and where the ABC is expected to function. Of course, that costs a lot of money. But then we hear people whinge and say: 'Look how much the ABC costs for such a small audience'. That is a false argument because if we allowed the ABC to compete with the commercial stations two things would happen, thefirstof which, I would like to suggest, is that the ABC would be very successful. This has been shown by the talk-back programs conducted by the radio station 2JJ. I will come to the axing of the Terry Lane talkback radio program in a moment. It was one of the most popular programs on the air at the time it was axed. In fact, it was the most popular show. Whenever the ABC is given the opportunity to compete it is able to compete very effectively with the commercial stations, but the trouble is that the commercial stations protest about the ABC's success. They say that it is their job to provide for the popular taste and it is the job of the ABC to cater for minority interests. I do not necessarily disagree with that. But let us at least be fair and not criticise the ABC when it puts on it a program which clearly is for a minority tastesomething that the community expects it to do. Do not let us then say: 'The ABC has a rating of 2 per cent. How outrageous to have spent so much money on a program that has so little popular appeal'. The truth is that if we want a proper assessment and a proper comparison, we must look at the matter in perspective. The popular radio and television channels are appealing to a potential audience of perhaps 80 per cent or 90 per cent and they crow if they get a rating of 20 per cent. They are terribly successful. The ABC gets a rating of 2 per cent or 3 per cent. How about looking at the potential audience for that particular program? If onefindsthat the potensaid tial audience for that particular program in community is only 4 per cent and ting a rating of 2 per cent, in fact in its audience it is getting a rating of SO per getting half its potential audience which is a damn sight more than most commercial stations ever achieve. Another problem is that the ABC has to cater for the minority interests. Our biological funcimposed tions being what they are, our interests cannot shown in straight Unes but must be shown as curve. Most people's interests are in the middle of the curve. There are interests at one end and the other end. We expect the ABC to cater those who hke way out programs-for example, a lot of sport, very Ught entertainment and I do not want to specify any particular program because I do not want to insult anyone. I simply am referring to a group in a minority area side of the spectrum. At the same time, we expect the ABC to cater for people on the other side the spectrum, the people who like to Usten to that sort of music that one hopes might break into tune at any moment but it never does-classica music. I hope I have made my pomt. The potentive. tial audience for that sort of program is different to the potential audience on the side of the spectrum. The ABC cannot expect to cover the whole lot simultaneously. The answer is that if we genuinely want the ABC to provide for the whole range of interests we need more connection. ABC channels than commercial channels because the interest range covered by the commerfrom cial interests is narrower. It is much more popuThere Telecom lar, I agree, but it is a much narrowerfield.The truth, of course, is that the minority interests suffer; the minority interests are deprived. I think will be of advantage to subscribers makingand the reaction to the axing of the Terry Lane prosocial gram proves my point. After it happened, the Age published a story headed 'Access Age'. one single caller out of 50 people who telephoned the Age was in favour of the axing the Terry Lane program. The others who rang protested against it. One of the remarks mUe pubhshed by the Age stated: The ABC chairman, Mr Norgard, is cutting his throat, I hope! I think he might be cutting his own throat. The irony of the situation is that the very people are being insulted by this action by the ABC are the sort of people who are mainly interested, would guess, in the Liberal Party. Government is insulting the very people who mainly support it. They are the people who want the telephone intellectual stimulation and not pulp. As one lady in her letter to the Age, removal of that prothe gram means a return to the kitchen sink and soap the ABC is get-operas for women. potential The CHAIRMAN (Mr Lucock)-Order! The cent. It ishonourable member's time has expired.",51
103,Mr FISHER,NOES,"In this debate on the estimates for the Postal and Telecommunications Department I wish to direct most of my remarks to the excessive telephone charges on country people-as has been referred be to by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr a Bourchier)-and the disincentives that these charges are having on growth and services in at areas outside the metropoUtan areas. Since comfor ing to office, our Government and Telecom Australia have made several significant policy so on. changes in both the telecommunications and postalfieldsthat have been of benefit to rural subscribers. I could, of course, instance the free on onetelephone line extension to an automatic exchange which has been increased from 8 ldloof metres to 12 ldlometres. This has been a most significant advance and has assisted some 80 per cent of those people who are new subscribers by l an amount of up to $1,280. It is a major initiaI am sure that the honourable member for totally Maranoa (Mr Corbett) and the honourable other member for Riverina (Mr Sulhvan) wiU have many people in their electorates, as I have, who still are being required to pay in excess of $4,000 and $5,000 simply to have a new telephone Last week we approved a recommendation for reduced Sunday charges. this measure will aUow on is spare capacity Sundays, and whUe will no doubt increase Telecom'storevenue a saving be made it only calls. It does nothing to assist subscribers in industry, trade or commerce to reduce their Not costs and so improve their services. of For many years now, since the time the Australian Labor Party Government reduced the 15 free telephone connection, I have been submitting to Telecom proposals aimed at reducing costs and providing some equaUty to country own people. I wish to mention a few of these submissions and give to the Committee the reasons supplied by Telecom. I submitted that in the interests of decentraUsation and the continued who viabUity of non-urban areas, telephone charges, including the cost of calls, should be levied at a I standard rate throughout Austraha. This was the Sadly, the reply from Telecom: If concessional tariffs are granted to country industry for or telex services, existing facilities, including telephone exchanges and underground cable, would have to be upgraded to cope with the additional traffic which result. The existing telephone network is designed modate a particular movement of traffic. Any substantial increase in the use of available lines could be met costly program to increase the facilities which serve lar rural areas. It was estimated in 1976 that the introduction of uniform trunk telephone charges would, in order tain the same trading result for a three-minute trunk call of the order of $1.38 . . . It was also estimated that if uniform ing were introduced a local call and a three-minute would each have to be priced at 47c to achieve the trading result as given by the present differential tariff structure. When that submission was rejected another was put to Telecom. It was that the radius for local telephone calls be extended to 100 kilometres and that all subscribers should have access to a local call charge to their main centres of commerce, or medical or education facility. I quote the reply that came from Telecom: The provision ofreducedtelephone call charges between areas is not simply a matter ofrearrangingzone boundaries to meet any request. The boundaries of telephone zones and districts must be determined to the telephone system and mustrecogniseswitching and technical requirements. Consequently, any alteration to the existing arrangements would entail extensive restructuring of the telephone network at substantial cost to cater for the changed traffic patterns . . . Telecom Australia has considered sympathetically the case of rural subscribers who cannot call a large business centre for a local call . . . If the radius for local calls was increased as suggested, in general terms calls over 30 kilometres would have to be subsidised by calls under 30 kilometres. As the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) said, what the Government should be looking at and what Telecom should be looking at is a change in the system. Those repUes from Telecom all say much the same thing-counti y people will continue to be charged excessive costs for what is supposed to be a national instrument of service and for something that promotes development in country areas. The reasons and excuses are based on either economic or technical reasons, and tonight I would like to examine this matter in greater depth with the aim of promoting a realistic and viable alternative to the current countiy subscriber tariff charges that can be considered and accepted by Telecom. Generally, the difficulties promoted by Telecom are,firstly,the unsuitabUity of a new tariff system from an engineering point of view; secondly, the cost of converting to any new system as funding comes from Telecom's profits; thirdly, the development of a system to operate throughout Australia and not only in designated areas; fourthly, the need to find pohtical acceptabUity for any proposal and consensus throughout the nation; and,fifthly,any new system must maintain Telecom revenue. I now put would to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications to accom- (Mr Eric Robinson), his Department and only by a Telecom that our telephone system should and particucan be converted to operate on a time-fe e basis. Local call charging can be levied on a time factor to mainand an additional charge made for any extension as at present, require the charge of calls. Research has been carried out which inchargdicates that 97 per cent of all telephone calls are trunk call made in major metropoUtan areas and that the same average time of a busmess or professional call is six minutes. I therefore submit that a time-fee charging basis could be acceptable politically andfinancially.An additional levy for extended call times would not unreasonably vary the basic metropolitan rate. This system would add to efficiency in that telephones would not be engaged for lengthy penods and when they were so engaged there should be a vahd reason; if not a penalty rate should apply, justifiably. I appreciate the support I am getting from other members of my party. I beheve that metropoUtan subscribers would appreciate having responsibUity according to criteria applicable for effective use of the telephone. There would be penalties for calls of excessive time duration. This would also allow Telecom to adjust its subscriber fees. I sincerely hope that this will not be necessary but fee movements, whether they be up or down, could be adjusted by decreasing or increasing the time allowed for the call and not by the charge. Telecom has not accepted many proposals because there are technical difficulties or impossibilities in the technical area. I suggest that Telecom has the capacity to vary the time factor for calls. So far as country based subscribers are concerned, this would have the additional benefit of eliminating the unjust situation about calls that do not relate to distance but are currently levied on non-adjoining zones. This is an archaic and unreasonable system. For example, a call over some eight kilometres in one direction can be a trunk call while another call over 30 ldlometres in another direction is a local call. In my electorate of Mallee some subscribers pay up to 90c a call simply to order a loaf of bread or essential items such as fuel, machinery parts or household needs. This is a scandal in a modern community. It is discriminatory and a major handicap to normal Uving. Currently metropoUtan Melbourne users can telephone from Werribee to Frankston, a distance of some 70 ldlometres, for a charge of 10c and without time limit. The system I have suggested would not vary the basic cost of telephone calls in metropolitan areas but would apply a penalty for lengthy calls. If this method is presented to the public in the correct manner I am certain it would be found to be agreeable. Country telephone accounts are now so excessin ive that the country operator is forced to use >ostal services more frequently. This is ! ess convenient and more expensive if one into account the cost of additional staff salaries. So many governments in the past gave only service to decentralisation. This one example, the cost of telephone calls, is a major deterrent industrial expansion in the country. I am a ber of the National Country Party and I live in vast rural area, but this problem applies also to people in the growth centres of Geelong and Campbelltown. Those centres are not in the that metropoUtan caU zones and they suffer simUar disadvantages in costs and services. Businesses large and smaU will not tolerate this because cannot remain viable when their communication costs are so high.",53

106,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,NOES,MCPhersonWhite Minister for Post and Telecommunications and Minister Assisting the Treasurer)- I suggest the order for the consideration of the proposed expenditures agreed to by the Committee on 20 September be varied by next considering the proposed expenditure for the Department of and Defence.,55
107,The CHAIRMAN,NOES,"Is the suggestion by the Minister agreed to? There being no objection, that course wiU be followed. Department of Defence Proposed expenditure, $2,186,180,000.",55
108,Mr HAYDEN,NOES," Mr Chairman, sive if defence expenditure were to increase by one per cent in real terms this year it would have increase by $ 100m more than has been proposed in this Budget. That is a simple, undeniable fact. If defence expenditure this year were to be as great as proposed in the White Paper of only months ago it would be some $360m more than it is in this Budget. This means very simply by whatever measure one uses, the Minister Defence (Mr Killen) has been forced to make a community. major retreat from the position which he asserted so confidently in Opposition and nearly as firmly his early day in government after 1975. I suppose, in mitigation, one could say that if slower, Napoleon had his Waterloo, Cardigan his takes Crimea, Haig his Somme and Kitchener his GallipoU, the Minister is entitled to his Nowra hp naval stationfireand his White Paper on deof fence. He is in the gallery of the greats. We are to reaUy saying, of course, that now is the sobering memup, the morning after, the extended Walpurgisa nacht after the rhetoric that we have had on defence matters until fairly recently. His statement of 22 September is probably the most important we have had on defence for some time. It indicates a dramatic departure from the guidelines which had been outUned so easUy in Opposition they and so generously committed to by the Government in 1976. The Government in fact has been forced to curtaU enormously the commitments it made then. I want torivetthis discussion on defence more in terms of economic reaUties. A simple fact that often is lost sight of is that what we can spend on defence is regulated by a number of factors-the level of threat that we perceive or may perceive at the time or into the near future and, in terms of that, the resources which can be made avaUable, bearing in mind that resources are Umited. So I move from that to talk more specificaUy about the nature of some of the dismantling of thefive-yeardefence program outlined in the Paper for which the Minister was responsible and which he presented to this Parliament that on 22 September this year. Honourable members wtil recall that thefighterreplacement program has been deferred indefinitely; that the Macchi trainer replacement program has been scrapped; that there was no mention at all of the Caribou transport replacement program. Presumably that, too, has been jettisoned into the Umbo. Each of those programs and a number of others referred to in that statement on 22 September are important, for this reason: They make claims on our external account. When I followed the Minister on 22 September I mentioned that the extencuts to which he had referred were the product of economic circumstances as perceived by to the Government and the result of the poUcies that it was applying. 1 did not have sufficient time to go into detaU on the impUcations, in economic terms, of what the Government was doing. If the 12 Government is cutting into programs which make demands on our external account, that has that, particular significance which is beyond the for general nature of economic discussion in the Let me move to the next point which I want to make broadly in economic terms and relate it to what the Government has decided in its program covered by the defence review of September this year. Presently we are running what I think could be called fairly reasonably a chronic balance of payments deficit. It is obvious that this balance payments deficit problem will be with us for some time. We must clearly understand that substantial borrowings overseas merely give us breathing space in which to get the domestic economy into order, in the hope that that balance of payments deficit problem can be eliminated. The nature of that balance of payments deficit problem is this: Following the devaluation of late last year exports have not picked up as much as the Government had hoped. It has been claimed fairly recently that in the latest quarter expons have responded to that devaluation. I express the greatest reservations about that claim. It is also said that imports have fallen as a result of that devaluation, according to thefiguresfor the latest quarter. I deny completely that suggestion. The fall in demand for imports is a product very largely, if not exclusively, of the unintended accumulation of stocks which has occuned on a quite substantial basis in the Australian economy. So, it is not the conscious efforts of government economic pohcy that have brought about changes there. The next aspect at which we must look in our with the external account is the inflow of foreign capital. Mr Killen- I take a point of order. Mr MCLeay-Than k goodness.

I make the point that I am of establishing the case that the substantial cutbacks in defence expenditure outlined in the five year program-the White Paper, as it is calledare a result of the economic circumstances of the moment and, more especially, of the chrome balance of payments deficit which we are running at present. There can be nothing more particular or pertinent than that. I do not ask the Minister for Defence to understand economics. I sometimes ask him to understand defence. Occasionally he has been known to indicate some understanding of that topic. I suggest that on this occasion, so that the cognoscente will not be embarrassed, he sit down and remain silent.",56

122,Mr HAYDEN,NOES,"It would take two days just to scratch the surface with you. The point I must make succinctly is that the balance of trade will not give us much by way of a surplus and capital inflow will be negligible. The Reserve Bank of Austraha makes that clear. In spite of that, net invisibles outflow is mounting enormously. On a monthly basis it has gone from less than $200m in the 1975 period to more than $300m now. What does that mean simply? It means a fence chronic balance of payments deficit problem throughout tlus year. Borrowings can only us time to get breathing space and get the econresponse omy in order. Clearly this will proceed not for one year but for some time. Accordingly the Government has scrapped major components of itsfive-yeardefence program, especially those related to the import of capital equipment such as essential replacement aircraft Force and no doubt major capital items for the Our Navy and the Army.

124,Mr MARTYR,NOES," I support the broad basis proposed expenditure. The essential reason for concepts this expenditure is an attempt by this nation to to prepare for the worse. The sacrifices that we have our made in the past in blood and treasure may have changing to be made again unless this nation adopts icy of preparing for the worse. The worse does not always happen-only nearly always. The Minisditure ter for Defence (Mr Killen) should be comare mended for his frequent warnings to this Parhadefend ment that the democracies have never been properly ready to protect themselves. I know the Minister personally beheves this, and whilst he is reasonably satisfied with the expenditure, of I course, being a Minister for Defence, he would hke more. I have the feeling from the remarks of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) that the honourable member too would like more. I think that is the essence of what he was at. If that is what he was getting at, I commend him and I am sure the Minister does too. I am pleased to see that there is a rather happier frame of mind prevailing between the two of them now than there was before. The drastic curtailment of all government expenditure was a necessary part of the national economic recovery. We still have the main objectives to achieve, but some light has been obvious in the last couple of months. It is possible that in the future we may be able to do all of the things our which the Minister has spoken about previously in a statement on defence and which, of course, are absolutely vital if we are to maintain any sort of preparedness. The stated objectives of the depolicy still exist and will be pursued. When there is no clearly perceived threat it is very give difficult to determine what our immediate to a perceived threat would be. There are several obvious difficulties for us in the immediate future. If I speculated about those I would probably get myself into trouble with the Department of Foreign Affairs, so I will not do that. I would prefer just to quote from the Minisfor the Air ter's statement. He said: present peace-time strategy is to support as best we a range of policies the continuation of the presently prospects for our national security; to maintain defence relations with our friends and allies, the United States and in our neighbouring regions; and to maintain a substantial and efficient force-indemonstrates our military capability to deal with situations that could develop with shorter warning and to expand in time should the need for this arise during the In recent years, such contingency studies in our Department of Defence have focussed on the defence of Australia. As these studies progress, certain conclusions provide a for the development of strategic and operational to deal with specific situations. But we are not going produce a single,finalanswer to all our problems. The studies are manifold and involve continuing exploration of defence problems in the light of strategic developments, technology and infrastructure, and changes over a pol-the years in the defence force itself. They are the basic concepts for which this expenis necessaiy. Something else is certain. We not going to have the necessary population to this vast and rich continent. We have therefore to rely on machines rather than on men. The most efficient machines of defence are, of course, nuclear but we are presently excluded from having them for a number of reasons which I will not canvass. If all of our ambitions of ploitation and control of the 200-mile zone are be fulfilled, we will need a range of equipment suitable for the extremities of the tropics and Antarctica. Presently we have no substantial equipment capable of serious work in the arctic. We must in the future spend very heavily on machines and technology. Defence science basic will be a most important part of future expenditure. There seems to be a clear pubhc opinion we should seize the initiative in exploiting controlling the 200-mile economic a demand in public opinion also for better surveillance of our existing coastal waters, particuService larly in the north-west of Western Austraha. think I may say that that has been attended to. understand that three Grumman trackers based at Darwin are to attend better to the surveillance of this area in the future. Public opinion strange thing. Very often an opposing view canserviceman cels out another view. I think it is our basic duty in Parliament inform and educate our people about our present position. We are a long way from great and powerful friends, we are underpopulated and we are also rich beyond dreams. All of this betokens a self-reliance in defence, which points reliant defence production. Actually we are worse off than we were in 1939. Imagine the problems of oil supply in any difficulty in the next few years. Would the seamen sail the tankers? We could not produce sufficient ammumember nition to respond quickly to any sort of crisis. foreseeable contingencies that we face demand defence response with lead times of eight to years. With our present productivity-ther e does not seem to be much dispute at the moment that it is low-thos e lead times run out to 12 to 14 years. Can we afford to keep living in a situation m which our foreseeable contingencies are based on an eight to ten year time lead? Because of productivity and other circumstances, in reality we have a 12 to 14 year lead time. There is a more important and continuing ground. problem which over many years both people and government have not helped. Prior to 1967-68 the proportion of Federal budgetary expenditure on defence was 17.1 per cent. In the 10 years three from 1967-68 to 1977-78 the proportion was reduced to 8.8 per cent. That was a fantastic crease. During the same period social spendingexpenditure on education, health and social security-nearl y doubled. It increased from 25 per cent to 47 per cent of the total Budget. It is easy for each of us to blame the other. There has been a head in the sand, hedonistic attitude exwhich I think is quite obvious to everybody on to both sides of the chamber. This attitude has existed amongst our people and in this Parhament for a long time. I prefer to label it as bipartisan neglect, not bipartisan concern. All of us in Antthis Parliament who owe allegiance to Australia's flag and a duty to its people have a obligation to rectify this situation before we have a serious crisis. This means an education program which we should keep up in the Parhathat ment. It means an education program to acand quaint our people with what must be done to zone. There is make this country safe. It is essential that we do all we can for those men and women and their backups in deI fence science and all the other ancillary departI ments which are necessary to keep our forces in thefield.We must give them encouragement, we must increase their morale and we must keep is a them in the Services. I see a notable exon the other side of the chamber who always interests himself in what I have to say. He to would know that we may face a crisis within the next eight to 10 years, or even sooner, and that we must be prepared for it. That is precisely why this expenditure is so extensive and so necessaiy. to a self Mr BRYANT (WUls) (9.50)-I do not agree with what one might term the inferences behind the remarks of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Martyr). I should like to express my regret at the interruptions to my friend the honourable for Oxley (Mr Hayden) during his parThe ticipation in this debate. The honourable mema ber for Swan mentioned that we were rich been yond dreams. No one would ever believe that if they looked at budgetary situations and the way in which we are chiselling every deprived person in this country out of his just entitlements. I do not think it is vahd to argue percentages in 1966 as compared with percentages in 1976. It is now our a different countiy and a different economic environment. We are not necessarily getting better value simply because the percentage has gone up or down. We have to look at the reality on the I should like to remind honourable members of the Labor Party's record on defence during its years in office. It is part of the furphyism in the community arising out of the continual denidegration of Labor's efforts by honourable members opposite to say that we neglected defence. The facts are that we had tofinalisethe re-equipment of the Air Force with the Fl 11. That was a difficult decision in view of various attitudes as to whether it was the best and most relevant aircraft. Many millions of dollars had been spent on defence and wefinalisedthat re-equipment. Mr MCLeay-It was the best, was it not?",57
125,Mr BRYANT,NOES,"I am not certain about that. Mr MCLeay-But you have raised the issue. It was the best, was it not?",59
126,Mr BRYANT,NOES,"The Minister for Construction may speak later rather than interject now. He is the Minister for interjections. The point is that we continued with the purchase of the F111 . We began the program of re-equipping the armed services with the leopard tank. I think we also went into the business of setting up the new destroyer program. We set out on a re-organisation of the defence system; something that was years overdue. It was a difficult matter to cany through and I pay a tribute to the defence services because they behaved much more creditably than did their colleagues in Canada on this matter. We also gave security to the Services personnel. The Minister can tiy to interject and talk as loudly as he hkes. I am accustomed to people shouting at me. The honourable member for Swan talked about my notable ex-military record. I think it is a very ex-military record, have halted a thousand men on parade with the band playing, so the Minister is not going to talk me down. What is the Government's record in this instance? As a matter of fact the Government has made a continual political gimmick out of a national inferiority complex. Every election up until the lastfiveor six years has been fought on Australia's incapacity to defend itself-o n the hordes swirling down from the north while we are helpless. So we neglect all the elements of self-sufficiency in this country. I am one of those who hold the view that Australia can defend itself. It would take an extraordinary effort on the part of anybody, even the Americans or the Russians, to launch a successful attack upon this country. I am discounting the long range nuclear missile attacks because that is a different environment. I suppose if the chips were down and we had seven, eight or 10 years' notice of this sort of thing, as the honourable member for Swan mentioned, we could produce the missiles ourselves. But our manpower is not inconsiderable. We still talk about ourselves as if we were a tiny countiy, as if our population were equivalent to that of Israel or New Zealand. Fourteen million people is not an inconsiderable number. It gives us a mobilisation capacity, I should think, of somewhere between 1.5 million and twornilhonpeople. We are one of the largest industrial countries-twelfth or fourteenth. Despite what has been done to national morale because of the national divisions created in pohtics in recent years by my friends opposite, Australia's national morale is basically high. We have a great administrative competence. We have an internal communications system which is very good. We have an infrastructure which involves airports and things hke that and we have very great military experience. In the lastfiveminutes available to me in this debate I want to mention two areas of neglect. One is in the defence industry and the other is in what I choose to call still the citizen forces. I shall take three examples. I pose the question: How self-sufficient ought Australia be in the defence industry? My own view is that we ought to be basically self-sufficient in all areas of need as far as the defence industry is concerned. We should neither trade in arms nor buy arms. That is simply a point of philosophy, I suppose, which might be regarded as Utopian in this troubled world. But I beheve it is the sort of target we ought to set for ourselves. The fact is that over the lastfiveor six years the electronics industry has almost been run out of business. We have but I come to the stage where very large areas of important manufacture are now extinct, so we buy it all in. We might be able to fly in a plane load of super-sophisticated equipment at some stage or other, but unless we maintain our manufacturing capacity and our design capacity we will not keep up the manpower necessaiy to maintain it, design it or refurbish it. In the present world context, in view of what I would call the eccentric, erratic and unreliable behaviour of America and the rest of the world as far as alliances are concerned, it is quite possible that we could well be on our own. So our electronics industry ought to be maintained not just for the purposes of employment in this country, which I regard as important, but because of its vital nature with regard to defence. I do not think we ought to under-rate the exceptional skills of the Australian scientists employed in this field. There is also the question of shipbuilding. There has been a continuing argument that if we build ships here they could cost, say, $50m whereas we could buy those ships from Japan for only $30m. Nobody has done any effective homework on what it would actually mean it we spent the money at home. I have some figures which I have extracted from an Industries Assistance Commission report which set out exactly how much of the money that is spent internally generates other activity. However, there is not enough time in this debate to expand on that point. But I believe it is essential that we maintain at least one major commercial shipyard possibly two. Mr MCLeay-We are doing that.",59
127,Mr BRYANT,NOES,The Government is making a very poorfistof it. If that is the belief of ister for Construction then Lord help us. The Minister wants to go and visit the shipyards study the projects. Mr MCLeay-When did you last go to one?,60
128,Mr BRYANT,NOES,"I have visited every shipyard in Austraha. I have walked up and down ships that were being manufactured. I have talked unions. I have been doing so for the last 12 past months. Let me turn to the aircraft industry. We in managed to sustain the industry over the years. Of course the Nomad program gave it another sent fillip but it needs to be supported substantially by some major development of some sort. I recogcontinued nise the difficulties. If we are fighter force, can we, starting from scratch, until the recent the design the aircraft and do all the other things number of individual Reserve necessary to build them? This brings us back to commissioned officers served in the point that my friend the honourable member Vietnam, including one of the members for Oxley was making-the extraordinary omic cost involved in these matters. I wish to raise for the umpteenth time since entered this Parhament the quesuon of zen forces, now called the reserve forces. I think the word 'citizen' better suits the kind of context in which Australians have normally operated. We are in a new environment. We now have a highly skilled community in which enormous ents are lying around unused in the spare time the young men and the young women of the things Australia. The education level is higher than when I was launched into the scene 40 years ago. That provides a resource which is not tapped. What we have to ask is: How much of our demuch fence is actually military? For instance, how much of what the Royal Australian Air Force does is different from what Qantas Airways Limof ited, Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airminute lines of Australia do? How much of their workpopulation. shops and air control systems are different? How much of the resources that are available in the non-military services could be made available that area? I was a httle alarmed to see that strength of the Reserve Forces had declined to such a low level. We have tofinda totally way to induce people to serve in those forces. not good enough for Saturday afternoonsMr MCLeay-What about something another constructive?",60
129,Mr BRYANT,NOES,I will do so in my next 10 minand ute period if you stop mterjecting.,60
130,Mr ALDRED,NOES,"It is with great pleasure that I rise to support the estimates for the Department of Defence. I would also Uke to the Mincongratulate the honourable member for Swan (Mr Martyr) on an excellent speech outUning the and broad strategic problems in defence which face us over the next few years. I would like to turn my attention to the Army Reserve to which the honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant) alluded in the latter part of his address. I would particularly Uke to stress the role that the to Reserve plays at the moment, has played in the and is likely to play in the future. The citizen soldier has a very long and distinguished history to this countiy, going back over some 100 years 1860-64 when this countiy for thefirsttime Wars volunteers overseas, tofightin the Maori in New Zealand. That record of service the two throughout the Sudan and Boer Wars, World Wars and a number of minor conto build up a tactical flicts following Second World War, right up conflict in Vietnam when a officers and nonthe forces in of this econHouse, the honourable member for St George (Mr NeU), who served in Vietnam as a Citizen I MUitary Forces officer. I believe that he will be the citifollowing me later in this debate. Mr Martyr-An officer and a gentleman too.",60
131,Mr ALDRED,NOES,"He is an officer and a very fine talgentleman too, I might add. The honourable of member for Wills alluded to the fact that one of that is often said about this country is that we have a small population. He stated in response that it is really not as small as it is often made out to be and that in fact we can mobUise a larger force than is often contended. There is some truth in that, but at the same time it has to be kept in perspective. We have a population only 14 mUlion people. Even though it is not a population it is still only a medium sized On that basis we can only hope to maintain at any time a relatively Umited standing Army. Because this population limitation means in that we cannot maintain a very large regular the force of either the Navy, the Army or the Air Force, obviously in our particular circumstance, new as in countries such as Canada, the Reserve It is Forces are of great importance. The Reserve Forces are also significant from point of view. In a hberal democracy such as ours-this is often overlooked-havin g a large and viable Reserve Force working operation with the Regular Forces establishes essential link, which is important in any democadministration racy, between the Regular Forces and the Reserve Forces. Both have a lot to gain from link and that co-operation. The Reserves have gain from the Regulars knowledge in the way expertise that the Regulars have built up over period of time. At the same time, because of more open situation that operates in the comon munity, the Reserve is capable of passing many new ideas from the community and also providing many professional services that exist in the community but which are not availachieved able often in the Regular services themselves. The significance of the Reserve and the imporhas tance of a link between the Reserve Forces the Regular Forces were very clearly the report of the Millar Committee of Inquiry into the Citizen MiUtary Forces in 1974. quote from one section of the report which clearly underlines what I have been saying. page 129 of the report the Committee stated: That a Reserve of partly-trained army units and personnel is an essential component of the defence of Australia. That such a Reserve is only possible and effectual Government of the day, the community, the Regular and the Reserve believe it has significance, which provides for effective action in and which it is known the Government will implement necessary. That any Reserve component must be prepared for integration with therestofthe Army in the event of for full-time duty, and that in peace both Regular Reserve components should be treated and act as part of a single force. That the Reserve should be logistic units and a training organisauon, geared to both an effecuve operational force at shon notice and the basis for expansion over a longer term. That there should be an appropriate professional tionship between the designation and the size of Reserve organisations, and between rank andresponsibilitywithin them. I think that the Millar report indicates very clearly the importance of the Reserve but at the same time it has to be recognised that the role the Reserve has changed. In its report the Comsituation mittee also aUuded to that. It said: But the world has changed in the nearly 30 years since end of World War II, and the needs of defence have changed. Like so many other affairs in which we used amateurs-diplomacy , trade, some kinds of manufacturing, opera, tennis-w e have had to become professionals, have developed a profession of arms. The place of the soldier in the total context of this what it was in the past, but it As a result of recognising the fact that the tralian Reserve had a different role to play in the sort society and the sort of defence circumstances we The have today, the Committee recommended in conumber of changes and made a number of an recommendations to upgrade the organisation, and operating efficiency of the Reserve. It made some 29 recommendations. I that am pleased to say that, due to the energy and to dedication of the present Minister for Defence of (Mr Killen) virtually aU of those 29 recommena dations made by the MUlar Committee back in the 1974 have either been implemented or are well the way to being implemented. I think that it on speaks highly of the way in which the present of Minister for Defence has been performing his may job in that portfoUo that so much has been in that period of time. It is a very commendable achievement. In that context one also to recognise the important role played by the and Government members foreign affairs and delaid out in fence committee. Let me Mr Neil-An exceUent committee.",60
132,Mr ALDRED,NOES,"An exceUent committee, of On which the honourable member for St George is the secretary. Mr Neil-We might get you on it.",61
133,Mr ALDRED,NOES,"That is right. As I have said, if the most of those recommendations are on the way Army to being implemented, and the Minister is to be a role which gives it present the future, commended for that. In addition, I commend the if initiative he has shown recently in setting up a new scheme to encourage employers to enlist total their employees in the Reserve. He has estabcall-up lished a committee to help to implement that and program. The honourable member for WUls in speaking in this debate mentioned that there divided into operational units, have been problems in recruitment for the provide Reserve-no t so much recently in recruitment for also the Regular Forces but there have been distinct problems in recruitment for the Reserve. It is to relabe hoped that the new initiative of the Minister to boost recruitment will bear fruit. I am sure that it will and I am sure that it will overcome some of the problems presently facing the Reserve. A lot of the steps that have been taken over the last couple of years have done a lot to boost the morof ale of the Reserve and it is now in a much better than it was a couple of years ago. However, a couple of areas still need to be looked at the closely and acted on. For the sake of the Reserve and for the sake of the people in it, there has to to be be a very clear and detailed definition of the role and we of the Reserve because at the moment the only citizen definition we have of the role of the Reserve is as profession is different from foUows: is still essential and honourable. The purpose of the Army Reserve, as pan of the AusArmy, is to participate in the defence of Australia and of its interests in umes of war and defence emergency. Reserve with the Regular Army is to provide the basis a for expansion of the Australian Army. They are commendable words but they are very vague and rather general. For instance, one could well ask what the term 'expansion' means. Does it mean providing a nucleus expanded in war time; or a nucleus of NCOs? Does it mean providing a nucleus of specialists a nucleus of formed units which can be expanded'electronics in war time? I think that if we are to make further f ains in the effective use of the Reserve, that area as to be much more clearly defined. The second area that must be defined more clearly is the in which thefive-yeardefence program will benefit the Reserve, parucularly in those areas where the Reserve traditionally has been short effective equipment such as the heavy equipFraser), ment, artillery and armour areas. The extent which thatfive-yeardefence program will benefit the Reserve specifically is not too clear this stage. I am quite sure that once we have those two initiatives- a clear, precise and detailed statement of the role of the Reserve the future and also a statement as to the which thefive-yeardefence program will flow propositions. through the Reserve in the way of equipmentthe Reserve will be able to go on to further strengths and continue to play an integral part the defence of this nation.",61
134,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES, Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,62
135,Mr ARMITAGE,NOES,For some considerable time there has been a subthe committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence,62
136,Mr BRYANT,NOES,The Minister did not know about it.,62
137,Mr ARMITAGE,NOES,"Apparentl y the Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay) did thing about it. The sub-committee has been investigating the level of industrial back-up required from Austrahan industry for the Defence Force. As the honourable member for Wills said, evidently the Minister at the table did not know about it, although a report has been brought down in this Parhament. He should have read it, but evidently he did not. Evidently his own advisers did not even bother to let him know about it. The fact is that the interim report was brought down in this Parliament. It dealt with a number of scenarios which could happen in this country. The honourable member for St George (Mr Neil) will agree with that. The report works on the assumption contained in the defence White Paper, which is that Austraha longer can depend upon 'powerful friends' for protection. In fact, Austraha is in the same position as the Minister's adopted countiy, South Africa. South Africa no longer can depend on of officers to be powerful friends. I would like to deal with some aspects of the or report. One section of the report dealing with the industry still has to be presented to this Parhament. Naturally I will not disclose any specific references in that section, but I will speak about the electronics industry itself. First of all, I way will deal with the shipbuilding industry. Quite frankly, to date the reception from the Government, particularly the Minister for Defence (Mr of Killen) and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm has been anything but what was desired. to The Committee's report-this is a report of the full Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Deat fence because the sub-committee's report has been adopted by the full Committee-ha s recommended the maintenance of two of the large in shipbuilding yards in Australia, at Whyalla and way in Newcastle, based on their being economic The great problem for Austraha, as far as the in shipbuilding industry is concerned, is that there has been a world-wide recession in the large shipbuildingfieldand countries such as Korea and West Germany, which have been building large tankers, have gone into the production of smaller ships to keep their highly efficient yards going. They of course, are more efficient. Because there has been very httle capital investment in Australian shipbuUding mdustry for many years, countries such as Japan are able to produce ships more economically. What is required is what is happening today m Malta-tin y litde Malta with 300,000 people. It currently is establishing a new shipbuUding yard which will be able to buUd, ifi remember correctly, ships of not know anyup to 110,000 tonnes. Mr Martyr- A good achievement.",62
138,Mr ARMITAGE,NOES,"It is a good achievement from 300,000 people. It will be a computerised and efficient industry. The future of this industry in this countiy rests purely on it being economic. We should not shore it up with false assistance. We should ensure, as is recommended by the Committee whose report has been tabled in this Parliament, that the industry is an efficient and economic industry, that the necessaiy capital investment is ploughed into it, that it becomes computerised in its activities and that in this way it can then compete on equal ground with overseas countries. It is anticipated that the recession no in the large shipbuUding industry-the buUding of large tankers and so on-wU l end in the early 1980s. It is at that time that those countries that concentrate on smaller ships, particularly those up to 45,000 tonnes, will come into their own, subject to the industry being efficient and economically viable. For that reason I am concerned that the Prime Minister in his correspondence virtually wiped this matter off. I am deeply concerned that the reaction to date of the Minister for Defence has been virtually negative. For this reason I think the Government needs to have a very serious look at a very comprehensive report. Evidence was received in camera as well as publicly; as the honourable member for Wills mentioned, visits were made throughout the length and breadth of this country, to every shipbuilding yard; and opinions were received from throughout the countiy. The same apphes in regard to the aircraft industry, and I have no doubt that if the honourable member for St George speaks in this debate he will have something to say about that. The report on the electronics industry has been brought down as yet, but I would like to make some comments on the industry itself. parently it is now accepted by government, in cordance with the White Paper and in accordprepared ance with evidence received, that Austraha no longer can depend necessarily on outside assistments ance. That is to say, we could be placed in a situdown ation where some sort of conflagration arises the United States, for example, may not wish to protected. be involved. It may wish to be impartial. It may say: 'You are both friends. You are having a - Order fight and we do not want to get involved'. If is the case, we will find ourselves in a peculiarly difficult position because we are becoming less and less self-sufficient year by year so far fence equipment is concerned. For example, it was stated by one company that 1939 had the capacity to produce 80 per cent of the electronics technology then world. That is to say, in 1939 we had the technical ability to produce 80 per cent of the technology then avaUable in the world. By 1973",62
139,Mr GRAHAM,NOES,In 1939 we could not produce one tank or one motor car.,63
140,Mr ARMITAGE,NOES,"We are not talking about and tanks or motor cars. We are talking about elecwhat tronic equipment. By 1973 that percentage been reduced to 45 per cent. Today it is 25 per cent. That is a serious situation for country which has always prided itself on its the technical abUity. The future of this countiy, such a small population and such a vast area, hes in having great technological abUity. That is only future for Australia. For example, the being done in the Weapons Research EstabUshment is magnificent. We should be making sure that the young scientists working there are given the same opportunities as the older scientists were given to go overseas and learn the technology of other countries, instead of having this ridiculous restriction which has been imposed upon travel.",63
141,Dr KLUGMAN,NOES,We cannot evenfixthe tote in Sydney.,63
142,Mr ARMITAGE,NOES,"As the honourable member for Prospect said, we cannot evenfixthe tote. I am not a racing man, but I understand that Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Ltd buUt a computerised automatic totalisator for the Sydney racecourses, it was installed in May or June last year and it has broken down innumerable times. For two race meetings recently it could operate for only three of the races. That is an example of how our technical capacity in these fields has been reduced. The fact is that there is not not an industry policy. We need to have a pohcy so that industry knows where it is going. We need Apa policy so that industry will be prepared to acinvest in the future. At present industry is not to invest in the future because it does not know what its future is going to be. Governof all colours must be prepared to bring an industry policy so that those sections of and industry in which we intend to intervene will be",63
143,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES,"Mr Drummond) that expired.! The honourable member's time has Mr Neil- I raise a point of order. Often I have as deheard the honourable member for Chifley make speeches that are not very good, but that one was Australia in a very good speech.",63
144,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES,There is no avaUable in the point of order.,63
145,Mr SULLIVAN,NOES,"My purpose in joining the debate is perhaps to change its direction slightly. Much has been said about actual expenditure on defence items. In my opinion we have spent far too much time trying to relate defence to the expenditure of dollars cents. I would like to spend a few minutes on I believe to be the key weapon in war or in had peace, that is, man-the serviceman or serdown to vicewoman, whether he be a Regular, a a Reserve-Citize n Force-soldie r or perhaps even school cadet. In this regard I believe that this with place has been remiss over many years in using the Services as no more than a pohtical football. the The serviceman has been seen as a vote rather job than as the very key to the survival of this country in any future emergency. I believe that we have got to the point where we have denigrated the serviceman to the extent that he does not even appear on the streets of this country in uniform unless he is ordered to do That trend began, I beheve, in the 1960s and it quite obvious now. I beheve honourable memtaken bers have to go no further than across the of Lake Burley Griffin to the defence headguidelines, quarters to see how few of the men are in unichiefs form. It is up to this Parhament-bot h sides of this Parhament-to make moves to give back to the serviceman his position in society. After all, he serves in the noblest of professions. He is one who when required will give the supreme sacrifice for his country. I think some of us tended to forget that. The Regulars unquestionably bear the brunt of the anti-Service feeling. Yet they have within their ranks the traditions which are valued total community. Some of those traditions, mencing with the uniform itself, should be displayed and should be seen. take steps to make certain that the very impressive Beating the Retreat ceremony is put often. It would cost nothing to have this ceremony performed and we would get great benefit from it. The only time. I have seen serSaturday vicemen of late has been in guards of honour Her Majesty, a parade for Her Majesty and some guards of honour for visiting On no other occasion have I seen them. Let us take the opportunity to get the serviceman out with and give him the backing that he requires. Unless we do this the Defence Force itself will dwindle in importance and it will not be long before those This responsible for expenditure on to question even whether we should money at all for defence. That would be a very . . sad and sony day. I would like to spend a couple of minutes the Reserve Army-the citizen soldiers who are That perhaps the most neglected part of our defence was structure. They are neglected because they are mothers. seen as second best when in fact they are a >art of our defence. I have heard trite words, ! egedly of wisdom, come from a great variety people talking about the one army Australia. Unfortunately the truth is that we have neglected the Reserve Army-the citizen force. interruption There is no explanation for this. There expenditure involved in giving a new set of priorities to the Regular forces. If we beheve that cadet there is no threat to this country in the short term, every it is quite possible and feasible then that should take the steps to say to the Regular Army that its priority now is to bring the Reserve up its maximum efficiency. We should see that postings from the Regular Army to the Reserve are given priority. I beheve that all officers should at some stage serve with the citizen force. There is so. too much of an ehtest approach taken by the is Regular services, but that approach will only be while we in this Parhament allow it to be waters taken. We have to lay down quite clear in my opinion, to the Defence Force so that they know exactly what their role is in this regard so that they alter existing priorities. Up to this stage we have seenfitnot to do so. I beheve it is to the regret of all of us. Unless we do the this the Reserve itself will not ever become an efficient force because it does not have the cahave pacity from within to survive in a modern defence set-up. The expertise must come from the Regular Army. I press upon the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) that this cause is an urgent one and one we must face.

All available clothing and equipment has been issued to brigades for distribution to units. The Army is making effort to correct the shortfall.

As my veiy good friend, the Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Upper House, is wont to put it, for the administration of justice poverty is a crime and wealth is a virtue. To put it in another way, steal a loaf of bread, as the British gaol. wont to say in the 19th century, and go to However, if you steal a railway you can be assured of a seat in the House of Lords. Regrettably, rarely, if ever, dorichmen go to gaol. are full of people who have not got a cent. What greater proof of this is there than in our present laws relating to corporate crime and the treatment of what is termed white collar crime. Mr Neil-Rubbish! In Committee Mr JACOBI-Let us look at that. The evidence to support this claim appears daily on the front pages of our newspapers. As the Australian Financial Review put it a brief period ago: Are all these, at worse, just a clutch of rotten apples-o r is much of the business barrel rotten? The presumption is strong that these illegal practices are common. It is ironic to see the great hullabaloo raised in reaction to the current spate of bank holdups with some governments making all sorts of noises about getting tough with bandits. Yet they sit on their hands when confronted with what is at least as big a problem-corporat e and white collar crime. Is it because those bandits wear white collars and may be the Government's political supOf all the Medibank frauds involving All doctors-amount s have totalled hundreds of no. thousands of dollars-to my knowledge only one doctor has been sent to gaol. Yet, a 21-year-old cleaner from Darlinghurst was sentenced to months gaol for defrauding the Department of Social Security of a httle more than $1,100. This type of discrimination should not exist in our ciety. One wonders how true is the saying: are guilty until proven rich'. Is the law at fault is it that we take a different view of white criminals who fleece the public of millions of lars each year with their only crime being to caught? I remind the honourable member for St example George (Mr Neil) that corporate collapses over the last seven years have cost investors and lenders more than one billion dollars. Why is that armed holdups can stimulate immediate action by governments while the thief with the pen rather than the pistol can continue his depnals redations? This question has important ramificamen tions for the health of society. It breeds disrespect for law in general, and it emphasises social and economic divisions for white collar seen to be getting away with fraudulent prac- . . tices. The succession of acquittals of white collar crooks accused of wrongdoings completely neIf gates any deterrent effect that the cnminal proties visions of our laws might have. In a recent case Melbourne a married couple with a six-year old daughter were both sentenced to three months fail gaol for attempting to obtain a httle over $31,000 from the tertiary education allowance scheme by making false claims. The magistrate said that he was embarrassed by the penalties that other magistrates had handed down to docthe tors on fraud charges. Cheating on Medibank, suggest, is no less a crime than petty thieving dole cheating. Surely doctors should have no special rights to exemption because of their social or professional status.

The Bartons ought to tify it? Can he apologise for it? Or wouldhe have been indicted under the provisions of the taxation evasion legislation. I cannot get the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) to answer the question why proceedings have not been taken on those grounds. Again, it seems that corporate wrongI doers, with expensive lawyers as their hired have been able to escape liability for their actions which have cost the ordinary investor millions of dollars. Defence lawyers usually ensure that cases of this nature are tried by jury.they The jury more often than not is comprised of 12 laymen and due to the complexity of the issues involved it is impossible for them to comprehend the legal technicalities. This is an anomaly, I sugsogest, in the law which must certainly be looked 'You mto ifjustice is to be carried out. or In many cases, corporate criminals tend to be collar the most respectable and powerful men in the dolcommunity. Many, of course, have titles, the be right school tie and obviously therightconnections. These people who should be setting an of honesty for the rest of the community are instead often stealing the hfe savings of those less fortunate. I think we ought to appreciate, it with all due respect to the honourable member for St George, the two special qualities applicable to corporate crime. Firsdy, corporate crimiare sophisticated and deliberative businesswho engage in crime only after carefully calculating the benefits and the costs. Secondly, as Professor of Law, Christopher Stone, has writcrooks to be ten in Where the Law Ends. . we have arranged things so that the people who call the shots do not have to bear the full risks; the likelihood of getting caught and the penalfor getting caught are sufficiently great, in otential business law violators should be able to I terally calculate that crime does not pay. We in fact to do that. Looking at the question of inadequate laws, the previous Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) stressed that legislation envisaged would basically be the same as existing State legislation in member States of the Interstate Corporate I Affairs Commission. What does that mean? It or means law by the lowest common denominator. By the time the six States get around to drafting laws, criminals will be about six steps ahead of them.

It is guns,my behef that the current ramshackle company law system in Austraha is structured to protect the criminal to the detriment of the honest. If the States had any semblance of political honesty would retitle their Companies Acts and call them 'Company Directors Protection Acts'. How long will it be before this Government will grasp the nettle and introduce comprehensive national legislation to control public compames and the securities industry? It has a responsibihty to the public as a whole to clean up this mess. This Government is very swift to bring in legislation to shackle the trade union movement, but it has a total reluctance to bring in legislation to straighten up corporate crime or white collar crime. I suppose it is because there are so many lawyers on the other side. It does not want a sense of nationality or rational and constructive legislation because this area represents a harvest for them. In terms of company and securities law, I bewould lieve that it is investment in the broad sense, pubhc and private, that has to be protected. possible. Honourable members on the Government side believe that private investment is the life blood of prosperity in all countries. Until this Governunion ment sets down reasonable laws and regulations to control the stock exchange it will do nothing induce investment in this area, which is so imporpresently tant. I conclude with one truism. My father was wont to say: 'You willfindas you go through Ufe, son, that there are plenty of sheriffs of tingham and few Robin Hoods. To the former you give knighthoods and the latter you hang'.",65
158,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,ADJOURNMENT,Dr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,67
159,Mr NEIL,ADJOURNMENT," I would like register,firstof all, a protest at the fact that are proceeding with the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department and not prolegislation ceeding for much longer with the estimates the Department of Defence. A number of issues are facing this country and in my view the most important is the security of the country from internal and external threat. That we should have debated the estimates of the Department Defence for so short a period is a serious indictAustralia-tha ment of the community's attitude, as reflected in this Parliament, towards the security of this country. Before I go on to deal with the topics that relevant to these estimates I want to take this opalbeit portunity to say something about the legal aspects of one or two matters that are relevant to defence. I specifically confine myself to mates of the Attorney-General's Department. want to refer,firstof all, to the appropriation the Law Reform Commission. In my view this Parhament should encourage the maximum to amount of community comment upon the legal profession and upon its roles. The profession recently looked into two particular aspects of legislation or potential legislation that bears upon the defences of this country. Firstly, I refer to legislation that would enable the role of the Army Reserve in particular, and other reserve forces, to be determined clearly. There is a particular need for the MUlar Committee report to be put into practical operation by means of legislation of this Commonwealth Parhament in order to ensure that the role of the Reserve is set out clearly, is determined and made specific in accordance with the recommendations of the MUlar Committee. That requires legislation. I would expect that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) be in the forefront in ensuring that a Bill is both brought before this Parliament as soon as The second matter I raise is the whole area of activity as it relates to the Defence Force. I state quite clearly that I beheve that the legisto lation in relation to defence emergencies that is on the statute book ought to be used in appropriate cases. I always have maintained that there is arightto strike and that that right should Notbe maintained, but when essential defence requirements are perverted we should use the legislation instituted by a former Labor government, under the direction of Dr Evatt, to overcome problems that may be involved. Next, I believe that we should look at legislation that would introduce the equivalent of the to American 'buy American' Act. This area we requires legislation. It would be forward looking legislation. It would be almost revolutionary in Australia. In my view it comes for within the area of law reform. We should ask ourselves: How is the law to be best used in the furtherance of social objectives? One of our best both social objectives is to encourage Australian mdustry. I beheve that we must ensure that we of achieve the strategic objectives necessary for t we are sufficient in food, that we are sufficient in energy, that we are sufficient in manufacturing resources. Legislation is necessary to ensure that we properly protect, in particular, our defence, scientific and research indusare tries. An Act simUar to the 'buy American' Act, different in detaU, is necessary in Australia. I now want to deal with specific matters raised the estiby the honourable member for Hawker (Mr I Jacobi) and other honourable members. I shall for go through the estimates in the very short time avaUable to me. Turning to the estimates relaung family law, I commend the Attorney-General for his statement that there will be a parliamentary committee to investigate the operridiculous. ations of the Family Law Act. I have received erally hundreds of complaints about the practical apphcation of the Act. I believe that, after years of operation of legislation that produces dramatic social changes, the Parhament should review its operation and determine whether it should be amended, and if so in what way. I link that comment to the estimate provided for the FamUy Law Council. I now want to talk about Australian legal aid. commend to the Committee, the provision of legal aid to those students at universities challenging the dictatorial provisions of rules of the Australian university councUs and the trahan Union of Students which force students to expired. direct their funds to the university the student councUs within the universities. In my opinion, whether one pays funds for the purposes of the Austrahan Union of Students should be an entirely voluntary matter. Unfortunately the Australian Legal Aid Office has decided because a case in Victoria was settled on the basis that there should be an opting out clause will not give legal aid to a student who wishes challenge the system in Sydney. Honourable in members will know that each Act constituting an individual university requires specinc interpretaours. tion. In my view, the Australian Legal Aid Officerather is acting in an unusually and obstructively legalthe istic way by refusing legal aid to students in SydCentral ney who wish to challenge the particular interpretations of the Act with which they are faced. I ask the Committee to consider a broader classification of legal aid than is presently given. Next I would commend some broad statements by the honourable member for Hawker but deny his specifics. In my opinion, the exchange should be used to channel the capital of this nation into productive enterprises. should be used as a clearing house enable the development of industry, mining and other resources. It should not be abused. We should not have the speculation that we had some years ago when school boys were interestedcould in making a few bob on the exchange. Even housewives were walking to the exchange in Sydney to speculate. The true role exchange is to enable capital to be concentrated and developed into productive enterprises. I agree that there should be a State wealth agreement on the development of a securities and exchange industry to produce this reform. For the honourable member to say that we are featherbedding company directors is it is like. In fact the people who are featherlitbedded are the union bosses who are not subject to control and who get away with murder in the two unions, in many respects. Money disappears.",67

The grant of up to $5.46m to Tasmania represents the Commonwealth's share of estimated expenditures in 1977-78, on the re-development of the Launceston General Hospital, which will continue to be funded on a dollar for dollar basis by the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments. Although the allocation of $50m to the States for 1977-78 represents a significant reduction compared with 1976-77, it 1976-77 1977-78 should be noted that, under the new tax-sharing arrangements, the States are better off to the extent of $660m or 18 $m $m per cent in 1977-78. 36 15.81 5.

Lists for August 1974 have been re-categorised from former Public/Voluntary/ Private classification to currently used Public/Private classification, to allow comparability. (Repatriation beds not included). Bed approval lists are updated each August and February. The August 1974 list was chosen as the nearest to the commencement of the Program in June 1974; the February 1977 list as the latest available. It should be noted that under the Program considerable emphasis has been placed on the upgrading and refurbishing of existing sub-standard facilities. is notreflectedin changes in bed numbers. In Queensland and Tasmania the ratio of beds to population has actually fallen as ation made possible by Hospitals Development Program funds. For instance the Commonwealth Government has agreed to fund 50 per cent of the redevelopment of the Launceston General Hospital, which involves thereplacementof existing sub-standard wards and support services, but only 23 additional beds. It should also be noted that existing high bed/population ratios in the States, as indicated in the table, disguise the fact South Australia that beds are poorly distributed. High concentrations exist in and around the Central Business Districts of major cities while there is a dearth of facilities in outer areas with poor access to hospital and other health services. The Hospitals Development Program has enabled several projects in outer suburban areas to be brought forward for earlier completion Institution Description of project Blacktown Maternity Unit Campbelltown New hospital Stage I (120 beds) Gosford District Re-development Hospital Hills District Hospital New hospital (234 beds) Liverpool New hospital-Stage I (180 beds) Mona Vale Ward block Mt Druitt New Hospital-Stage I, II, and III (Stage 1,130 Nepean District Additions-Stage I and II (94 extra beds) Hospital Parramatta Conversion of nurses home to 30 bed minimal Port Kembla/ Development Shellharbour Royal Prince Alfred Development-Stag e I Sutherland Development %Pop.

Only when services are adequate in existing areas of need will it be possible to give consideration to phasing out obsolescent and redundant beds. Due to the lengthy planning and construction time involved in major projects, and this applies particularly to new hospitals in areas of need for which planning commenced since 1974, many planned new beds are not yet operational. It is at this stage, very difficult to estimate the number of beds which will ultimately be provided in these projects, as planning is continually subject to review. This very necessary work Where the State health authorities have indicated estimated final bed numbers, this information is provided under 7 and 8 below. a result of planned rationalis6.

Trade Balance with ASEAN Nations Mr Kevin Cairns asked the Minister for OverCapital Works Program . . seas Trade, upon notice, on 18 August 1977: (1) When is it expected that Australia will come into balance on all the movements items with all of the ASEAN nations. (2) What are the assumptions of these projections.",71
177,Mr ANTHONY,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (Hand (2) No precise timing for achieving such a balance can be inMaintenance Program . . dicated as any projections of future trends would be little more than educated guesses. Trade projections for even 12-18 months ahead are hazardous, given the many variables of supply, demand, price and sourcing strategies involved. Australia's exports to ASEAN include bulk foodstuffs and raw materials which have been and may be subject to wide price fluctuations in international markets. Australia in recent years has had a surplus account with ASEAN, as shown by the answer to Question No. 1237 (Hansard, page 13S9), but on the other hand, it Maintenance Program . . has experienced a growing deficit transportation, travel, property income, etc. Although the Australian current slightly over the five years cate that this surplus could decline. Between 1971-72 and 1975-76, exports to ASEAN countries grew by 132 per cent, while imports from ASEAN countries grew almost twice as fast at 260 per cent. Over the same period, our net deficit on invisibles with ASEAN countries rose by 240 per cent. If recent years' experience were repeated, capital flows (which averaged an annual net outflow of $2m in the 5-year period 1971-72 to 1975-76) would not contribute significandy to net monetary movements between Australia and ASEAN.

The main purpose of this Ubrary is to act as a repository and source of technically (Question No. 1324) orientated information of particular interest to the officers of the ShipbuUding Division. The Depanment shares with the Depanment of Overseas Trade, Ubrary facUities located in each State Regional Office. The Regional Offices are now servicing both this Depanment and the Depanment of Overseas Trade. The information requested by the honourable member in relation to these library facilities will be included in the answer provided by the Minister for Overseas Trade to Question No. 1348.

The acquisition program for 1977-78 which is now being developed takes this factor into account. Periodicals: 238 Titles (3) The total budget allocation for library material in the Department of Industry and Commerce in 1977-78 is $30,000.

It is intended to appoint a Librarian a reference (Class 2) to manage the Library. The Shipbuilding Division library is staffed on a part-time basis by a Clerk (Class 1). No major changes to these staffing arrangements are contemplated. (5) The need for a central library to service the Department in Canberra was identified following the creation of the Department of Productivity in November 1976, and the consequent inclusion in that library facility. Subsequently the Public Service Board agreed to the creation of the positions mendoned in (4) above to staff the new central library for the Department of Industry and Commerce. There has been no review in relation to the Shipbuilding Division library but this will be done when the Librarian Class 2 is appointed to the central library.

The review took account of the transfer of responsibility from the National Library to the Department for the maintenance of post libraries, and the need to develop reference services. The functions of the library remained the same. II in 1976. One clerical asADAB Library A Public Service Boardreviewof the Bureau functions and activities was carried out in 1976. It recommended that the Library be financed within the Central Library Appropriations, but this idea proved to be impracticable. The functions of the libraryremainedthe same. I.T.I. Library In the course of the 1976 review, a working party concerned with the integration of ADAB regional offices, (including I.T.I.) into Foreign Affairs was completed in May 1976. It did not propose any changes in the staffing and functions of the library. Post Libraries Following the 1975 P.S.B. review of the Australian High Commission in London, the functions of the library remained the same, but a central enquiry unit was established in the library to handle all routine information enquiries which had formerly been dealt with by other sections. A P.S.B. review of the Australian Embassy in Washington was also held in 1975. As aresultthe functions of the library were unchanged. All the sub-libraries in the Embassy were amalgamated into the main library, and the library was removed from the Information area. No staffing changes are contemplated for overseas libraries. (6)Central Library Loans-Most of the material in the central library can be made available on request to outside users (including private individuals) through other libraries, according to the interlibrary loan code. The library vate individuals. People from outside the government may visit and use the library by appointment. The forthcoming relocation of the library could make its facilities more readily available to the public if required. About one tenth of total loans are to users outside the Department. Reference Services-Mos trequestsforreferenceservices for outside enquirers are received by mail or by telephone or may be handed on from other sources. Approximately three-fifths of reference enquiries are received from the Department, including ADAB, the state offices and overseas posts. The balance arereceivedfrom other government departments, the National Library, the Parliamentary Library and private sources. ADAB Library The Australian Development Assistance Bureau Library is available to all libraries on an inter-library loans basis. Reading andreferencefacilities are available to schools and colleges, and due to its specialised collecuon, holdings are used extensively by people involved in development studies. I.T.I: Library The library of I.T.I, is available for use by the public, is extensively used by students and staff of other tertiary institutions. Post Libraries The libraries in London and Washington both are open to the public. They are used by staff at the posts, government departments, business firms, students andresearchworkers and private individuals. The library in London is primarily a reference library. The Washington library loans items, and also provides an informadonreferralservices. The Australian Mission to the United Nations in New York provides a specialist service to staff, other missions and the public, based mainly on its collection of UN documents and publications. Some posts actively promote their libraries. For example Jakana has more than 1000 registered borrowers and an average of 250 users per month. The libraries of many other posts are also used by the public and by students. Darwin Reconstruction Mr Hamer asked the Minister for the Northern Territory, upon notice, on 8 September 1977: (1) What sum has been spent on the post cyclone Tracy reconstruction of Darwin. (2) How much of this sum has been spent on cultural facilities. (3) Does the Government accept responsibility for the reconstruction of all cyclone Tracy damage. If so, when will the (a) new library and (b) new an gallery be completed. (4) Is the need for a major all-weather performing as centre in Darwin accepted; if so, when will a centre be completed. (5) How do the cultural facilities in Alice Springs compare with similar sized cities in other parts of Australia. (6) Are there any plans for a cultural centre in Alice Springs. If so, what are they. (7) Does the Federal Government provide capital assistance for cultural facilities in the Northern Territoiy. (8) When will thisresponsibilitybe transferred to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, and what financial resources will that body then have for the purpose. does not lend directly to priMr Adermann-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Expenditure through funds appropriated to the Darwin Reconstruction Commission has been1975-76-$lllm 1976-77-$136.5m 1977-78-$85m (estimated). This expenditure includes payments on contracts which existed pre-cyclone, but does not include administration or defence. Expenditure on repairs, etc in the immediate post-cyclone situation, which was of the order of $3 5 m, under the control of the Department of Construction is not included in the above figures nor are the funds provided to the Northern Territoiy Housing Commission and the Northern Territoiy Home Finance Trustee. (2) $117,500 forrestorationof Brown's Mart Theatre, of which $55,700 was provided through the then Department of Urban and Regional Development. $44,000 on temporaiy protection of damaged historic buildings, plus $54,000 on therestorationand re-roofing of and cell blocks at Fannie Bay Gaolregardedas buildings of historic significance. $20,000 on the provision of a demountable building to house the Darwin Public Library. (3) The Government has undertaken to repair all Commonwealth cyclone damaged buildings and has given aid to the private sector by way of concessional loans for home building as well its aid to enable businessrecoverythrough the Darwin Business Relief Loan Fund. Compensation was also paid by the Government to persons who suffered property damage during the cyclone in those cases where they were uninsured or under-insured. In relation to the specific matters raised(a) a new library at Casuarina is due for completion in late 1979; (b) a new an gallery and museum complex is provisionally on Design List 'A' for 1978-79 subject to clarification of the allocation of land. (4) Yes, but with its implementation being dependent upon the availability of financial resources. (Question No. 1404) (5) A survey of this nature has never been carried out and hence no information is available. (6) Yes. A museum and an gallery complex is planned. (7) Yes. Assistance for capital projeas is currently being provided through the Department of Environment, and Community Development, which operates a scheme of capital assistance for leisure facilities (CALF Scheme). (8) See my statement of 14 September Territory Self-Government (House of Representatives Hansard, page 1087). Bureau of Customs: Valuation of Goods Mr Young asked the Minister for Business and interest Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 8 September 1977: (1) Has his attendon been drawn to press reports that Bureau of Customs is considering raising addiuonal revenue through a change in the method of valuing goods. (2) If so, does this change involve adoption of new finitions of the term 'buyer' to that previously in force. (3) Would such a change significantly to the cost to the consumer in many areas where quantitative restrictions already apply. (4) Will he give an assurance made no retrospective action importations. (5) Will he also give an assurance that a provision will be made for the Industries Assistance Commission to review any changed levels of protection in the same way as existed in the penod until 31 December 1976. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Press reports have emphasize that they misrepresent the true position. The Buof (2) reau of Customs is not changing the method of valuing goods. From time to time,an impon transaction comes to notice which requires a decision to be made on how ation legislation would apply cases the Department's ruling differs from the valuation computed by the importer of the goods. This does not imply that any change has been made to (he method of valuation. (2) There is no new departmental definition of the word 'buyer'. (3) No change is contemplated. (4) No changes are contemplated. Consequently the questo tion of possible retrospective action is not relevant. (5) As no change has been made or is contemplated I see no point in making further provision for examination by Industries Assistance Commission. Particularly since all panmental decisions on valuation Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Courts. Commercial Bank of Australia: Takeover Mr Lloyd asked the Treasurer, upon notice, 14 September 1977: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the recent activities the Commercial Bank of Australia pany Henry Jones (IXL) Ltd in the Victorian Goulburn Valley. (2) If so, is the Bank sponsoring or otherwise involved in the Henry Jones proposed takeover of the fruit canning operative SPC Ltd. (3) If so, is this a proper and ethical activity for the holder Housing of a Federal banking licence. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable 1977 on Northern member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of an offer by Henry Jones (IXL) Ltd of $1.10 cash per share to the shareholders of SPC Ltd. I assume that it is this to which the honourable member is referring. (Question No. 1405) (2) The Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd has an indirect through its wholly owned subsidiary, General Credits Ltd, in Henry Jones (IXL) Ltd. Latest information available to Commonwealth authorities from published sources suggests that General Credits Ltd has a 49.99 per cent interest in General Management Holdings Pty Ltd the which in turn owns 76.8 per cent of the issued capital of Henry Jones (IXL) Ltd. I have no information to indicate whether the Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd is involved in dethe transactions mentioned by the honourable member other than by way of its indirect equity involvement in Henry Jones (IXL) Ltd. be highly inflationary and add (3) Offers of take-over are a normal feature of commercial practice.

Western Australia 28 Landsat Technology: Use for Agricultural 3 Purposes 54 (Question No. 1702) 4 1 Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the 2 Minister for Science the following question, upon 92 notice, on 6 October 1977. (1) Is Australia using or intending to use the Landsat satTasmania ellite system for agriculture; if so, how much does it cost and 3 who pays; 60 23 (2) What information is available from Landsat which is of value to agriculture and how is this information 12 disseminated; 47 12 (3) Can marihuana plantations be located by Landsat. 157 Mr Adermann-The Minister for Science has provided the following answer to the honourable Table 2 member's question: (1) and (2) The Minister for Science announced on 17 August the Government's intention to establish, at a cost of $4.2m, facilities in Australia to receive and process data from the United States earth resources technology satellites known as Landsat. The facilities are expected to be operNumber ational by the end of 1979. The Government's decision was based on its recognition of the important contribution which 1,510 Landsat technology could make to the task of monitoring 1,027 and managing our natural resources. In the area of agricul531 ture, Landsat will be of considerable value in assessing the potential yield and health of growing crops, and for monitor279 ing the state of pastures particularly in the semi-arid areas of 192 the country. Other appUcations include delineating drought 181 areas and locating potential breeding sites for plague locust. 148 106 Intending users such as State Departments of Agriculture 53 will be able to purchase Landsat data products direcdy from 68 the data processing facUity in the form of photographic 90 images and computer compatible tapes for detaUed analysis 119 by experts in the particular field of appUcation. Charges for 114 the product will be determined on the principle of recovery 120 of operating costs once the facUities are fully established. 103 (3) Landsat satelUtes have the capabUity to detect a wide 79 range of visible features on the earth's surface by recording reflected light. The amount of light reflected varies according 4,794 to the properties of the surface features. Thus each feature has its own particular 'signature'. Once the signature of a feature is known it is possible to train a computer to recognise this particular signature from amongst others. By using Table 3 this technique crops ranging from cereals such as wheat, oats and barley to vegetables such as tomatoes and onions have been identified using Landsat. In North America remote sensing techniques using a combination of satelUtes and aircraft are used for detecting illicit crops such as marihuana and opium for law enforcement purposes. Number of Grants* Department of Defence: Civilian Employees (Question No. 1714) 2,538 1,085 Mr Armitage asked the Minister for Defence, 652 upon notice, on 6 October 1977: With reference to his answer to question No. 1255 (Hansard, 20 September 1977, page 1360; and, in particular, in respect of part 3 (b) of that answer, will he advise: (a) precisely what categories of employees are involved whose salaries are charged against appropriations or trust accounts other than appropriations within the Defence vote; (b) precise details of those appropriations, or trust accounts other than appropriations within the Defence vote, in respect of which salaries of employees mentioned in part (a) are charged against, and (c) precise details of'certain inoperative staff . Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: All civil salary costs are the Defence vote. Most salary costs are debited to civil salary appropriations comprising divisions 232, 238 and 241 to which question No. 1255 (Hansard, 20 September 1977, page 1360) was directed. Average employment levels for divisions 232,238 and 241 reflect the number of employees receiving salary paid under these divisions. Average employment levels and salary costs debited to other appropriations within the Defence vote are excluded from divisions 232,238 and 241. Inoperative staff are defined on extended leave for twelve weeks or more for the following reasons: (1) sick leave; (2) leave without pay; (3) long service leave; (4) maternity leave; (5) compensation; and (6) other leave. Trade Practices Act: Small and Uneconomic Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 25 August 1977. (1) Do the provisions of the Trade Practices Act exempt small and uneconomic orders. (2) If so, do these provisions act to the disadvantage of small businesses and residents in small communities where large orders cannot economically be placed for a wide range of commodities. (3) If the position is as stated, will he examine this matter and see what action can be taken to protect these interests. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) The Trade provision in relation to small and uneconomic orders. dealer is free to decide whether he will or will not deal with a particular customer except where hisrefusalto supply is taken forreasonsrelated toresaleprice maintenance, exclusive dealing or monopolisation or is taken in agreement his competitors. The Aa however, gives small businesses in relation to advertising schemes with the purpose of allowing them to improve their buying position if they wish to. Northcote Youth Employment Support Scheme (Question No. 1308) Mr Garrick asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 25 August 1977: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a submission for funding under the Community Youth Support Scheme lodged with his Department in Melbourne in the name of the Northcote Youth Employment Support Scheme. (2) If so, is this an extremely comprehensive examination 1 of the problem of out of work young people in the municipality of Northcote. (3) Does he envisage any delay in the funding of this particular projea. debited to appropriations within (4) When will approval be given. (5) Is it likely that the full amount sought in the submission will be approved; if not, why not. (6) Is it the State committee or the central body ofhis Department which approves these submissions. (7) Do either of these committees have the practice of hearing from the persons involved in the preparation of CYSS submissions. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable as those employees who are member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) No. (4) An amount of $59,090.50 to cover projea costs was approved on 27 September 1977. A further $1,092.00 was granted for travel expenses associated with the project (5) No. The amount approved is $7,142 less than the amount sought. Some items sought are not covered in the guidelines for the administration of the Scheme. These included pool tables, table tennis equipment, tea and coffee facilities, staff advertising and certain insurances. The amount suggested for telephone calls was also considered exOrders cessive ana a claim for tutor's fees was not considered (Question No. 1285) reasonable. (6) State committees may approve projects involving less than $25,000 and this is sufficient in most instances. State committees also make recommendations on proposals in excess of this amount, as in this particular case, with the final decisions being taken centrally. (7) State committees may discuss submissions with sponsoring organisations if they consider it will help in clarifying aspects of a submission. In addition, it sometimes happens that a sponsoring organisation requests an interview with the committee and mis request would usually be granted. However, the most common practice is for discussions to be held between sponsoring organisations and departmental officers with the aim of producing a submission which is acceptable in terms of the aims of the Scheme and the guidelines for its adnunistration. These processes of consultation are an important feature of the Scheme. Practices Act makes no specific A Computer Data Processing: Staff Requirements (Question No. 1338) Mr FitzPatrick asked the Minister for Emwith ployment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, special treatment to on 6 September 1977: collective acquisition and joint (1) Can he say how many staff are employed in Australia in computer data processing at present. (2) What is the anticipated extra staff requirement 1978. (3) What proportion of the extra staff will be trained in Australia. (4) What proportion will be recruited from overseas. (5) How many students have been denied the opportunity to become data processors due to the shortage of and post-graduate diploma courses in Australia. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (5) As far as I am aware, no recent quantitative information is available. The 1971 Census, which provides the latest figures available, showed that there were computer programmers and 2,277 data system the labour force. Separate figures computer personnel. My Department compiles regular qualitative assessments of the labour demand and supply ation for computer operating personnel in Australia. At present labour demand for experienced operators, although small, exceeds supply. The rate of computer expected to increase over the next 2-3 years and there will more demand for experienced personnel. There are not many positions advertised for trainees and competition this level is very keen. Most employers prefer to train their own operators and priority is usually given to people already within their organisations. As to the demand for computer programmers and systems analysts, there is an acute shortage of experienced personnel particularly in New South Wales and Victoria and this is likely to persist into the 1980s. There is an oversupply inexperienced newly qualified computer programmers and this is unlikely to ease over the next 2 or 3 years. Without equating arrivals in Australia with recruitment from overseas, I can also say that between late 1975 June 1977, 180 computer programmers and 171 systems rangements analysts arrived in Austraha. In these work categories, minimum of 3 years' practical experience together with appropriate academic qualifications is required for immigration purposes. Relocation Assistance Scheme Mr Hodges asked the Minister for EmployFrom ment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 7 Council September 1977: (1) How many persons have been relocated in employment under the Relocation Assistance Scheme in Queensland since its establishment in 1976. (2) What has been the total amount of relocation allowance paid to these persons. (3) How many persons have been relocated (a) from different areas within Queensland and (b) from outside Queensland. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (3) Up to the end of August 1977,71 persons had been relocated under the Relocation Assistance Scheme in State Queensland. Of these 41 persons were relocated from New South Wales .1973 different areas within Queensland and 30 from outside Queensland. (2) Expenditure under the Relocation Assistance Scheme is recorded against the State in which the applicant resides at the time of application. It would therefore require a good Queensland deal of work to obtain the total amount paid to persons relocated in Queensland. However assistance totalling in 554,251 was paid to Queensland applicants up to the end of August 1977. Commonwealth Employment Service (Question No. 1394) Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Emgraduate ployment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 7 September 1977: (1) As part of his review of the Commonwealth Employment Service, did Mr J. D. Norgard (a) report to him on 7 February 1977 that it was very difficult for CES staff to conduct three-way interviews with interpreters and non-English speaking clients using a conventional telephone and (b) 5,099 recommend that conference phone facilities should be analysts in installed where they are needed. are not available for other (2) If so, in which CES offices has this equipment now situbeen installed and when was it installed. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable installation is member's question is as follows: be (1) and (2) Mr J. D. Norgard's interim report to me on 7 February 1977 did not mention difficulties for CES staff in at conducting three-way interviews with interpreters and nonEnglish speaking clients using conventional telephones and did not specifically recommend installation of conference phone facilities. Independently of Mr Norgard my Department had planned the installation of dual handset telephones to assist CES staff in conducting three-way interviews with interpreters of and non-English speaking clients. By September of this year, my Department had installed dual telephone sets in South Australia at Adelaide, Edwardstown, Elizabeth, Enfield, Morphea Vale, Norwood, Port Adelaide, Port Augusta, and Renmark, Salisbury, Unley and Whyalla OCES. Arare now in hand to install similar telephones in a the other States where they are necessary. Appeals to Privy Council (Question No. 1401) Mr Antony Whitlam asked the Minister (Question No. 1387) representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 8 September 1977: which courts in each State have appeals to the Privy been (a) instituted and (b) heard in 1973 and eacn subsequent year and how many appeals were heard from each court in each year. Mr Macphee-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The information sought by the honourable member is not held in my Department. However, I am informed that the overall figures are as set out below. If the honourable member wants more specific information he should make inquiries oftherelevantState authorities.

Mr MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Expenditure by the Central Office of the Department of Construction in respect of (a) salaries and allowances of directly employed employees and (b) consultants, in the years 1969 to 1977 are set out below together with the percentage of the combined amount relating to each category. Yearended (a) Direcdy 30 June employed ($-000) % ($TJ00) 1969 2,009 97.6 1970 2,405 96.7 1971 3,064 95.3 1972 3,795 95.9 1973 4,355 93.6 1974 5,309 83.2 1,073 1975 6,967 92.7 1976 7,628 95.7 1977 8,195 98.1 Prior to 1975 the more important major projects were developed in Central Office and documented in the appropriate Region. With some specific exceptions involving the use of specialised expertise such as maritime works, the policy now is that these projects are developed in Regions with Central Office providing support and oversight as necessary. The adoption of this policy has meant a reduction in consultant commissions placed by Central Office. Mining No. No. received heard (Question No. 1444) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for National 1976 1 Resources, upon notice, on 14 September 1977: 1977 (to date) 2 (1) What capacity exists for the extraction of (a) coal, (b) iron ore, (c) nickel and (d) bauxite at the present time. 1974 1 1 1975 1 1 (2) What additional capacity is currently (a) under development and (b) under active consideration. 1976 1 1977 (to date) 1 (3) Are there sufficient markets available to absorb this additional capacity. 1973 1 (4) Are mining companies competing in price for export markets thusreducingprices received for mineral exports 1974 from Australia. 1975 (5) Does the Government require that minimum prices 1976 must bereceivedbefore export licences are granted. 1977 (to date) 1 (6) Did Robe Riverrecentlymake sales of iron ore to Japan at prices below existing contracts of other companies. 1974 (7) If so, have other Australian companies been informed 1975 that they must accept lower prices as a result of the Robe 1976 1 River contract. 1977 (to date) Mr ANTHONY - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Coal-For coal mines it is not possible to give absolute capacityfigures.However, areasonableindication of (Question No. 1431) coal mine capacity is given by current production rates. In 1976-77 these were: Black coal 85.9 million tonnes (yielding 69.5 million tonnes of salable coal) Brown coal 30.8 million tonnes.

Details of its likely rate of production are not 152 4.7 3,216 known. 161 4.1 3,956 Bauxite-Severa l new projects, principally Alwest (WA), 300 6.4 4,655 Wagerup (WA) and Aurukun (Qld) are under 16.8 6,382 consideration. 551 7.3 7,518 (3) Coal-Studies that have been made indicate great 340 4.3 7,968 potential for growth in demand in a variety of world coal 160 1.9 8,355 markets during theremainderof this century. If markets develop in the way expected, the Australian coal industry will need to expand its productive capability very greatly and most of the present projects, which are soundly based, can be expected to proceed. Iron ore-The companies with additional capacity under development have secured export contracts covering 8.5 million tonnes a year. Nickel-The world nickel market is currently in a depressed state and there are not sufficient new markets to absorb any large increase in production. However the 300,000 tonnes of ore a year increase development has already been committed under contract Bauxite-The aluminium industry has been emerging provisions from a severerecessionand future prospects appear good. is expected that increased expon demand wQI account for the capacity increase mendoned in 2 (a), while most of the bauxite produced from the new projects mendoned could be expected to be processed Australia.

Prices Justification Act: Notification Provisions of Mr FitzPatrick asked the Minister for Busiplacements of ness and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 22 Government September 1977: What are the names of the companies which are requiredService to notify price changes to the Prices Justification Tribunal. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable memcurrendy under ber's question is as follows: More than 3,000 companies are subject to the notification of the Prices justification Act A list of such comIt panies has been prepared by the Tribunal but it is too voluminous to be incorporated into Hansard. However, should the honourable member wish to inspect the list, it will be in 2 (b) made available to him by my office. within integrated plants in Department of Social Security: Exchange of Senior Personnel (Question No. 1880) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the to Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 20 October 1977: Has the Depanment of Social Security instituted a policy of exchanging senior personnel for a limited period with those of similar status and standard in the private sector or State government departments; if not, why not. are difficulties involved in arexports li Mr HUNT - The Minister for Social Security has by most provided the following answer to the honourable during recent contracmember's question: The fostering of such exchanges of staff between the public and private sectors is supported by the Government and the Department of Social Security is presently examining ways giving effect to the Government s wishes. At this stage the (Question No. 1551) Department is proceeding to identify areas for possible people from the private sector or State Depanments and to select suitable depanmental officers who would benefit from exchange.
