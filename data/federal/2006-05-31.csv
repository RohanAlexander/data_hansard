10,The SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The honourable member for Lalor is suspended from the service of the House for 24 hours understanding order 94(b). The member for Lalor then left the chamber. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Lalor has just been suspended from the House for 24 hours",20
11,Unknown,NOES,"Government members interjecting Mr Albanese-If you want to be in here all day, we can do that-on the basis that you have ruled her in breach of standing orders 89 and 90. I do point out, Mr Speaker, that, while clearly the member for Lalor was in breach of standing orders 89 and 90, the member for Lalor used precisely the same words in withdrawing as the Leader of the House did in parliament last Thursday. In fact, Mr Speaker, you ruled yesterday on page 5 of Hansard the following",20
12,The SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The member for Grayndler will come to his point of order. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, you ruled: Given the withdrawals by the Leader of the House, the motion was a valid motion. Why is it, Mr Speaker, that you ruled that way on the withdrawal and on the words used by the Leader of the House, ‘If I have offended grubs, I withdraw unconditionally,' yet you ruled differently for the member for Lalor? ",20
13,The SPEAKER,NOES,"I will rule on this point of order. The member for Grayndler has asked me to rule on a point of order. The member for Lalor was named for defying the chair. She was asked to withdraw, she did not withdraw, so she was named. Mr Albanese-Further to the point of order, Mr Speaker: you will find that an examination of pages 33 to 39 of the House of Representatives Hansard of Thursday, 25 May 2006 indicates that on a number of occasions the Leader of the House was asked to withdraw unconditionally. For six pages of Hansard, he refused to do so in defiance of the Speaker",20
14,The SPEAKER,NOES,The member for Grayndler has made his point. I will rule on his point of order. Mr Albanese-and you ruled yesterday that that was an acceptable withdrawal-the same words that the member for Lalor used.,21
15,The SPEAKER,NOES,"The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. I will make two points. First of all, I did not rule yesterday. I made the point in response to a question from the member for Lalor as to where I would rule, and I have ruled today in accordance with the standing orders and House of Representatives Practice.  Speaker: yesterday you made a statement about two withdrawals, one last withdrawal by the Leader of the House, which was entirely in order, but in no way in that statement did you distance yourself from a disorderly withdrawal or a withdrawal with qualifications-and I regret that-and today, for the very same act, where the Leader of the House was not pulled up last Thursday, you have suspended the Manager of Opposition Business for 24 hours.",21
16,The SPEAKER,NOES,"The Chief Opposition Whip has made his point. I have ruled as I said I would rule. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I refer to your ruling of yesterday, where you said: Given the withdrawals by the Leader of the House, the motion was a valid motion. I also that the House endorsed the ruling by the Deputy Speaker to this effect, by negativing the motion of dissent from that ruling. I ask you to reflect on what has occurred this morning and what occurred yesterday and, so that the parliament can move on, that this be taken in the form of a question so that you can report back after question time on the nature of exactly how withdrawals will be considered to be effective. If not, every time the Minister for Health and Ageing gets to his feet, it is possible that this motion will be moved.",21
17,The SPEAKER,NOES,"The member for Grayndler will not debate the point of order or question it. I have allowed him to raise a point with me. I am happy to look at the points that he has raised, but I make the point that, when a member is asked to withdraw, they must withdraw without reservation. Ms Macklin-Why doesn't it apply to Abbott?",21
18,The SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! I made it clear in my statement to the House yesterday the way I would be dealing with this and the way that the House dealt with it last week. There is nothing further to add. I will look at what the member for Grayndler said and consider a response as is appropriate. Mr Albanese-Thank you for that, Mr Speaker. We accept that and indicate that we will be pursuing this after question time.",21
19,Mr ABBOTT,NOES,The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman independently investigates and resolves complaints about private health insurance and is an unofficial umpire in dispute resolutions at all levels within the private health insurance industry. Mr Bevis-Just apologise!,21
20,Mr ABBOTT,NOES,"I did. Currently, the ombudsman's power is limited in relation to investigation and mediation of disputes. He note receives and investigates complaints but only has formal jurisdiction to resolve them in respect of disputes with funds. This frustrates consumers, who have no clear alternative path of redress. The private health sector is a partnership between health funds and health care providers, including hospitals, doctors and ancillary service providers. It is not appropriate to pose close scrutiny on one part of the sector-namely, the funds-while not applying the same rigor consistently to the providers of services for which the funds pay benefits to their members. This bill therefore aims to ensure that the ombudsman will be able to effectively represent consumer interests arising from all aspects of their privately insured experience. Currently, the ombudsman's powers centre on complaints and investigations relating to the activities of health funds. The bill expands the responsibilities of the ombudsman to include receiving complaints by, and in relation to, health care providers and health insurance brokers. This effectively imposes the same obligations on all parties involved in a privately insured episode, instead of placing accountability solely on health funds. The ombudsman will not intervene in matters of clinical care: that remains-and must remain-the province of registration boards and state health care complaints commissioners. The bill also expands the types of documents of which the ombudsman can require production, such as health fund, health care provider and broker records. The ombudsman will have a power to compel parties to a dispute to undertake mediation where he deems it appropriate. This may include deadlocks in contract disputes between health funds and providers. The ombudsman can currently make recommendations about the practices and procedures of health funds. This bill expands this power to the practices and procedures of health care providers and brokers. Penalties will be included for parties, other than consumers, who fail to comply with matters relating to providing records, participating in mediation and reporting to imthe ombudsman. These penalties are in line with the penalties that currently exist in the National Health Act 1953 and will provide support to the ombudsman in relation to complaints and investigations. Furthermore, the bill ensures that the ombudsman and the staff of his office are protected from civil and personal liability as a result of their proper exercising of the increased powers. Peak bodies of the private health industry, including the Australian Health Insurance Association, the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Private Hospitals Association were consulted in the development of the bill, and I am advised that all support the proposed changes. The bill also includes a minor amendment to the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998 that applies to the 2005-06 financial year and later financial years. This is an administrative amendment that extends the time Medicare Australia-the former Health Insurance Commission-has to provide annual data to the Australian Taxation Office on the private health insurance rebates from 90 days to 120 days. The change will improve administration of the rebates and will not disadvantage those consumers who claim their rebates through their tax return. This proposed change follows a recommendation of the Australian National Audit Office. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. NA (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Brough. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",21
21,Mr BROUGH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (9.25 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the bill is to make changes to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, which will provide more choices in life for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. It is almost 30 years ago to the day since a coalition government introduced the bill that became the land rights act. The second reading speech delivered on 4 June 1976 talked about giving full expression to Aboriginal affinity with the land. (Quorum formed) The land rights act has been successful in returning land to Aboriginal people. Almost half of the Northern Territory is now Aboriginal land. However, hopes that the simple granting of land would lead to an improvement in the lives of local people have not been realised. The act has not been successful in facilitating productive use of that land. The reforms to the land rights act are the result of almost 10 years of consultation and three major reviews that have enabled a narrowing of differences among stakeholders. There is widespread recognition that the act needs to be amended to deliver better economic outcomes. Many of the proposed amendments come from a joint submission by the Northern Territory government and land councils. The reforms in this bill are designed to do three things: provide for individual property rights in Aboriginal townships, streamline processes for development of Aboriginal land and improve efficiency and enhance accountability of organisations under the act. At the time of the development of the land rights act, the future of townships was a point of debate. Most of the residents are not traditional owners. They have no choice but to live as tenants in these townships. If they want to own a house or start a business, they have to move. They are mostly marooned in unsafe settlements devoid of economic opportunity and hope for the future. The appalling levels of violence and abuse in many of these communities are a stark reminder of the failed policies of the past. The government has called for restoration of basic law and order in these townships. The right of safety for women and children is a threshold issue that will be the subject of a Commonwealth, state and territory summit in the near future. But of course law and order is not the only issue. Much more needs to be done to normalise life for these Australian citizens. The reforms to the land rights act will help to create a new environment offering better prospects and hope for the future. The bill provides for a new tenure system for townships on Aboriginal land that will allow individuals to have property rights. It is individual property rights that drive economic development. The days of the failed collective are over. Our approach will preserve the fundamentals of the act such as inalienable Aboriginal land title and will respect the role of traditional owners. Ninety-nine year head leases over townships with individual subleases under the head lease will make it significantly easier for individuals to own their own homes and establish businesses. The bill enables the Northern Territory government to establish its own legislation to administer scheme. To make home ownership a reality, the government has established the Home Ownership on Indigenous Land Program to provide low interest loans and other incentives and assistance to prospective home owners. The states are also expected to move to amend their Indigenous land legislation to enable unencumbered long-term leasing of Indigenous land. The Australian government is leading the way. The government recently signed a heads of agreement committing the traditional owners of Nguiu on the Tiwi Islands and the Australian government to settle an agreement by the end of this year for a township head lease. The people in Nguiu know where they are going and we expect other communities to follow their lead. The proposed amendments to the cumbersome and open-ended mining provisions of the act are based on a package agreed between all parties: governments, land councils and the mining industry. There will be quicker processes for exploration and mining on Aboriginal land and current ministerial powers will be delegated to the Northern Territory government. The changes include a sensible core negotiating period in which the government expects most exploration applications to be considered. We intend to provide the Northern Territory mining minister with a new power to set a deadline to bring negotiations to a conclusion. Importantly, the power of traditional Aboriginal owners to withhold consent to, or veto, exploration is retained. The bill includes further measures to cut red tape and facilitate economic development on Aboriginal land. The requirement for ministerial approval of leases and contracts entered into by land councils will be signifithe cantly relaxed. The minister will only need to approve leases that are over 40 years duration, rather than the current 10 years, and contracts of over $1 million, rather than $100,000 at present. The bill facilitates the mortgaging of leases by confirming that a lease can include agreement to future transfers. The bill provides for the delegation of decision-making powers from land councils to regional groups, including for exploration and mining. The bill also includes amendments to the provisions for the establishment of new land councils. The current provisions are effectively unworkable. The bill specifies that, to establish a new land council, a 55 per cent majority vote of Aboriginal people is required. The performance of land councils will be enhanced by the legislation. No longer will land council funding from the Aboriginals Benefit Account, ABA, be based on an artificial statutory formula. We are removing the guaranteed 40 per cent of annual ABA revenues for land councils. In future, land councils will be funded on the basis of workloads and results. The government wants to ensure that royalty payments are made in a transparent and accountable way. Payments without a purpose will be prohibited. Oversight of royalty associations will be improved so that all community members benefit, not just a select few. Through careful management, this government has built up the ABA reserve to over $100 million, which will enable a more strategic and targeted approach to investment. The ABA Advisory Committee will be strengthened by a provision to include additional members selected by the minister according to their professional expertise. Outstanding land claim matters are dealt with by the bill. The legislation disposes of land claims that cannot legally proceed or would be inappropriate to grant. Claims over stock routes that have been unresolved for over 20 years and cannot be heard or finalised will be disposed of. Claims to the intertidal zone and the beds and banks of rivers not contiguous with Aboriginal land or claimed land will be disposed of. A separate bill to come before the House will schedule substantial areas of land, including a series of claims to national parks and reserves settled between the Northern Territory government and land councils. The Northern Territory government, the land councils and peak industry bodies including the Northern Territory Minerals Council are to be congratulated on their constructive contributions to this very important reform process. The land councils, by proposing, for example, the delegation of powers to regional groups, have demonstrated that they recognise the need for change. The government has proposed these amendments for the next 30 years of land rights. The measures contained in this bill vital to improving the well-being of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. The measures are long overdue and usher the potential for a new era of opportunity for Australian Aboriginals living in the Territory. Debate (on motion by Mr Snowdon) adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT (2006 MEASURES No. 1) BILL 2006 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Julie Bishop. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",23
22,Ms JULIE BISHOP,OVERSEAS STUDENTS LEGISLATION,"Curtin-Minister for Education, Science and Training and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues) (9.36 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, the ESOS Act, and its complementary legislation regulate the international education and training services industry. This ESOS Act was introduced in 2000 to address problems facing the industry: the uncertain financial protections for students' prepaid course fees, the emergence of a small minority of unscrupulous providers and inconsistent quality assurance. The purpose of the legislation is to ensure that overseas students who come to Australia to study on student visas receive the education and training for which they have paid. It aims to protect the reputation of Australia's education and training export industry and are strengthen public confidence in the student visa program. The ESOS Act required that an independent evaluation be commenced within three years of its having received royal assent. (Quorum formed) The report of the evaluation was released by the former Minister for Education, Science and Training in June 2005. The evaluation report found broad industry support for existing arrangements but made recommendations for improvement. These amendments address some of the evaluation recommendations. As consultation with industry is ongoing, it is anticipated that further amendments will be submitted for consideration in the spring sittings. All providers who deliver education and training to overseas students must be registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS). It is a requirement of registration that providers demonstrate that they are ‘fit and proper' to be registered. The ‘fit and proper' test currently applies to providers and their associates only on registration. These amendments will allow for the ‘fit and proper' test to be applied not only on registration but at any time during a provider's registration. To prevent former providers with an adverse history in the industry from taking up positions of influence with other providers, the application of the ‘fit and proper' test will be extended from providers and their associates to employees, agents or officers of the provider where these persons have sufficient authority to be assumed to represent the provider in relation to the business of providing courses. Where it is clear that a provider no longer meets the ‘fit and proper' test, the act will allow for the suspension of their registration from CRICOS. These amendments will provide a further guarantee of the credentials of CRICOS registered providers. The ESOS Act ensures consumer protection for overseas students by placing the primary responsibility with the registered provider. Tuition assurance schemes and the ESOS Assurance Fund provide further certainty where the provider is unable to meet its obligations. These amendments will clarify a provider's obligations in relation to the receipt of course money and the provision of refunds. Allowing tuition assurance schemes access to student information will facilitate a faster placement of students in alternative courses where a provider is unable to meet its refund obligations. Providers contribute to the cost of regulation of the ESOS Act through payment of the annual registration charge (ARC). This is a legislated charge payable by the last business day in February of a year. Automatic suspension of a provider's registration for failure to pay the ARC by the due date will streamline the enforcement action taken against providers who breach this legislative requirement and encourage compliance. Further, this amendment, together with those which will require the payment of certain charges before, rather than after, a specified event will reduce time spent by my department in pursuing providers for outstanding fees and prevent those providers who do not abide by the rules from remaining in the industry. In introducing these amendments, my department has been mindful of the need to avoid unnecessary regulation, given the cost both to the industry and the Australian government. These amendments will have a minimal regulatory impact on providers and will streamline processes for the Australian government. Protection and enhancement of Australia's reputation for providing reliable and highquality education is crucial to achieving sustainable growth of this important export industry. These amendments will strengthen the regulatory framework and consumer protection provisions of the legislation. They will have the additional advantage of reducing the administration of certain aspects of the ESOS Act. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. DEFENCE FORCE (HOME LOANS ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Billson. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",25
23,Mr BILSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS LEGISLATION,"Dunkley-Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence) (9.44 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill seeks to extend the operation of the Defence Home Owner Scheme (the scheme), which is governed by the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990, from 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2007. The scheme provides members of the ADF with a subsidy on the interest expense incurred on a home loan. The subsidy is payable on a maximum home loan value of $80,000. The assistance is tied to home loans available through the National Australia Bank. The act specifies a finishing date of 31 December 2006. After this date, no new entitlement certificates confirming the eligibility of ADF members to the subsidy can be issued. The government has obtained the agreement of the National Australia Bank for the bank to continue the current arrangement until 31 December 2007. The scheme was implemented at a time when the banks were the major home loan providers and restricts the ability of ADF members to use the subsidy assistance to access the vastly different range of home loan products available in the contemporary home loan market. A review is now being undertaken by the Department of Defence to establish a home ownership assistance scheme that is more contemporary to meet the needs of both DeBILL 2006 fence and ADF members. This review is to be completed in time to allow the implementation of a new scheme by 31 December 2007. To ensure that eligible ADF members continue to have access to home ownership assistance under the current scheme, pending the outcome of the review, it is necessary to amend the finishing date currently prescribed in the act from 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2007. This amendment will also retain the sole loan provider rights of the National Australia Bank. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. NA BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 May, on motion by Mr Turnbull: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Ms Roxon moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes: (1) that the Opposition demanded action to prevent the abuse of legal professional privilege in the Inquiry into certain Australian companies in relation to the UN Oil-For-Food Program (the Cole Commission) in March; (2) that the Attorney-General arrogantly rejected that demand at the time and incompetently waited almost three months, after a Federal Court case, before taking action with this Bill; (3) that, while this Bill proposes a sensible, albeit late, change to the law, it will not solve the broader problem that the Cole Commission's Terms of Reference are limited; (4) that the current Terms of Reference do not allow the Cole Commission to make findings on whether or not Ministers, their offices and departments have discharged their duties under Australian administrative law and under international law (in particular UN Security Council Resolution 661); (5) that the Cole Commission has provided written advice that a change to the current Terms of Reference which would allow the Cole Commission to make such determinations is a matter that would be ‘significantly different to the existing Terms of Reference' and is therefore a matter for the Executive; and (6) that if the Howard Government had nothing to hide in the $300 million wheat-forweapons scandal, it would expand the Cole Commission's Terms of Reference to allow Commissioner Cole to make such determinations”.",27
24,Mr RUDD,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"Claims by the Prime Minister and parallel claims by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that they had in fact provided full cooperation with and full documentation to the Cole inquiry as of January this year were brought fundamentally unstuck by the submission to the Cole inquiry of the Office of National Assessments. The submission by the ONA stated: On 17 February 2006, certain Australian Foreign Intelligence Community (AFIC) agencies received notices to produce from the Inquiry into Certain Australian Companies in relation to the UN Oil-for-Food Programme (the Inquiry). What does all that mean? It means that, as of February, the Howard government had not provided full documentation to the Cole inquiry, but the Prime Minister had assured the country and the parliament that, as of January, they had. So we had the Prime Minister and the foreign minister saying, ‘full cooperation, full documentation provided', whereas the truth is each document which the Cole inquiry needed to do its job was having to be extracted from the government, kicking and screaming, using legal means. Voluntary cooperation has in fact been at a minimum, and this is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. Evasion and the government's pattern of cover-up in this sordid scandal has also been demonstrated in the way in which ministers themselves have provided their own statements to the Cole commission of inquiry. The trade minister appeared before the commission on 10 April. On the same day, his 15-page statement to the inquiry regarding his knowledge or otherwise of 21 cables that were addressed to him, containing concerns about the AWB's activities in Iraq, was made public. The trade minister stated on 41 separate occasions that he either ‘had no recollection', ‘could not remember' or ‘could not recall' whether he had read the warnings in question. It makes you wonder why the trade minister continues to draw a salary. On the next day, 11 April, the foreign minister had a similar lapse of memory. On 27 occasions, he said could not remember anything of the warnings that had been provided over the course of the wheat for weapons scandal. The foreign minister and trade minister have tried to justify their sudden inability to recall such critical documents by saying they receive thousands of cables each week-but 21 cables spread over a five-year period about a $300 million wheat for weapons scandal involving a country which Australia was about to go to war with? It beggars belief that ministers negligently did not bother reading or being briefed on cables which went to the heart of the effectiveness of the sanctions program against Saddam Hussein's regime. All these assertions, however, came unstuck in evidence delivered to DFAT Senate estimates on 29 May, when it was revealed that since 2000 DFAT has been ‘able to formally audit the process of a cable having been received, opened and actioned' and, in the words of DFAT officials, the department can: record the opening of a cable, the printing of a cable, the forwarding of a cable, the export cable and the closing of a cable. In other words, there is a full electronic cable log. The question we asked in here yesterday of the trade minister was: when the trade minister provided his statement to the Cole commission of inquiry on 11 April, was that statement constructed on the basis of having consulted the electronic cable log? What was the trade minister's answer? The trade minister's answer was no. This is a most disturbing state of affairs. Therefore, what did the Minister for Foreign Affairs do when he presented his statement of sworn evidence to the Cole commission of inquiry? Did he consult the electronic cable log or not? These questions raise further new questions which these ministers have yet to answer, concerning the accuracy of the statements they have made not just to this parliament but to the Cole commission of inquiry itself. Of course, when it comes to this pattern of cover-up, the core of the cover-up lies in the limited terms of reference Commissioner Cole has himself been given by Prime Minister Howard. Prime Minister Howard has run around the country saying there is a full royal commission of inquiry with full powers to do whatever that commission of inquiry wants to do. That is absolutely untrue and the Prime Minister of this country knows it full well. Prime Minister John Howard designed Commissioner Cole's terms of reference to produce a narrow commission of inquiry, not a broad-ranging one: one which would focus almost exclusively on the AWB; one which would focus only passingly on the role of ministers. But the critical element is this: Commissioner Cole has no powers whatsoever to make determinations about whether these ministers have done their jobs under Australian domestic law. That is a power he has not been given. That is therefore an area of a where he cannot go when it comes to reaching his conclusions. What we have had is a pattern of negligence, a pattern of cover-up and, as a consequence of this $300 million wheat for weapons scandal, damage to Australia's national interests. (Time expired)",28
25,Mr TURNBULL,ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT,"WentworthParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (9.52 am)-in reply-Listening to the member for Griffith last night, I heard him speak repeatedly about gross negligence and gross cover-up, and he reminded me of Lord Chancellor Baron Rolfe's remarks in the case of Wilson v Brett (1843), when he said hundreds of years ago that ‘Gross negligence is just ordinary negligence with the addition of a vituperative epithet'. It is a great pity that the vituperation in the speeches of the member for Griffith and other opposition members was not limited only to epithets. Their speeches on the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 2006 have not contested the substance of the legislation-they support it-but have simply been a series of vituperative claims and allegations about the subject matter of the royal commission. The government has held the most open and the most thorough inquiry into this issue anywhere in the world. The cooperation of the government has been complete and unprecedented. The notion that the government has tried to limit the terms of reference is absurd. The government provided the commissioner with terms of reference to allow him to investigate and make findings in relation to the knowledge of the Commonwealth of alleged misconduct by Australian companies participating in the UN oil for food program. That was noted by the senior counsel, Mr John Agius, on 14 March this year. The commissioner himself stated on 3 February that, if there was any suggestion that there had been a breach of any Australian law by the Commonwealth or its officers in relation to the terms of reference, he would seek a widening of those terms of reference to permit him to make a finding to that effect. No such request has been made. The Prime Minister has made it clear again and again, in this House and elsewhere, that the government would seriously consider any request by the commissioner for an extension of the inquiry's terms of reference. The government is committed to enabling the inquiry to do its job, and that is reflected in the fact that it has implemented all extensions and variations to the letters patent which the commissioner has requested. The inquiry is being conducted by the commissioner, Mr Cole. It is not being conducted by the member for Griffith or any other member of the opposition. The opposition seems to think that it can get some political mileage out of making claims about the very subject matter of the inquiry. The fact is that all of these issues are before the commissioner. The only judgment, the only conclusions and the only findings that matter will be those of the commission. The government has done everything within its power to ensure that that inquiry can be completed and can be completed thoroughly and has cooperated and supported the commissioner whenever he has sought assistance. I will just deal with one matter which was raised by the member for Wills, who has a habit of making wild claims in this House in respect of these matters. He repeated the false claim that the government had only given a cursory reply to India's request for assistance with an investigation into allegedly corrupt wheat sales. That statement is utterly false and the Attorney-General has asked me to advise the House that, when the Attorney-General's Department received the request from India, it asked the Australian Federal Police to assist in responding to India's request by obtaining witness statements and documents on a voluntary basis. The Attorney-General's Department advised India of the Federal Police's actions on the same day and that India would need to provide Australia with more information for the AFP to be able to investigate further using coercive powers. The Indian government did not respond. The Attorney-General's Department wrote again to the Indian government saying that, if they wanted Australia to use search warrants or compel witnesses to give statements under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, they would need to provide more information. Again, the Indian government did not come back. As the matter was not progressed by the Indian government, and as the allegations concerned Indian officials, there was no sufficient evidence to warrant a domestic investigation. If there is at some time in the future sufficient evidence concerning Australian offences, then they will be assessed in accordance with the normal Australian Federal Police processes. Australia's response was substantial and as complete as it could be with the information that had been made available to the Australian government. As the Attorney-General has said publicly, if India wants to reopen the case, Australia stands ready, as it has done in the past, to assist the Indian government under the very long standing arrangements for mutual assistance in matters of this kind.",29

TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL NA DEPRECIATION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 May, on motion by Mr Costello: That this bill be now read a second time.",31
28,Mr SWAN,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006 and I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House is of the view that: (1) the Government's failure to incorporate the enhanced Low Income Tax Offset into PAYG withholding schedules will significantly minish its potential impact on workforce participation rates; and (2) in view of the declining rate of workforce participation associated with the ageing of the population the Government has, despite the improvements contained in the Bill, failed to systematically address the punishing effective marginal tax rates faced by: (a) second earners, most particularly women; (b) individuals moving from welfare into work; and (c) middle and low income families with dependent children”. This bill seeks to enact the key elements of the government's budget related tax measures, including personal income tax reductions, fringe benefits tax reduction and adjustments to the capital depreciation arrangements for business. I wish to indicate at the outset that Labor will be supporting this bill. The measures contained in the bill will provide long-overdue relief to taxpayers and represent modest taxation reform. While these proposals are no doubt beneficial, it would be fair to say that the public have found these proposals underwhelming. Taxpayers recognise that every cent of their tax cuts have already been eaten up by rises in petrol prices and increases in interest rates. Then there is the deep level of unease about this government's extreme industrial relations proposals that threaten their wages, conditions and penalty rates and even their jobs. No amount of tax cuts could possibly make up for what they could lose from these extreme industrial relations changes, a topic I intend to return to shortly. There is also another reason for the relatively poor reaction to the budget and the tax reductions we are debating today. Put simply, the measures contained in the budget failed to invest adequately in future prosperity. The di- budget failed to use the once-in-a-generation opportunity provided by the commodity boom to invest in future drivers of growth. It was a budget that was more about spending the proceeds of prosperity rather than building on it. If we are to meet the economic challenges that are ahead-the reordering of global trade led by China and India, and the ageing of our population-we need visionary policies which go to the heart of lifting our flagging productivity and below standard levels of workforce participation. The way we invest in the skills and education of our people is central, along with our way of addressing the infrastructure bottlenecks that are holding the economy back and increasing the cost of doing business. Taxation policy is an important component of all this. The operation of our tax and transfer payments system impacts heavily on levels of workforce participation. It also impacts on savings and investment decisions. Capital accumulation and skills acquisition are both affected by our taxation system. When it comes to these factors, there is no doubt that the measures in this bill represent an improvement, albeit an incremental improvement, of the situation. But before discussing the detailed impact of these measures, I believe it is worthwhile to see where we have been and to apply some scrutiny to the tax record of this government. The coalition claim they are a party of lower taxes and enterprise. Nothing could be further from the truth. They are the highest taxing government in our history and the government's record on effective marginal tax rates is completely at odds with their claim to be a party of enterprise. This is party of choice nor a party of enterprise; this is a party that runs a taxation system that discourages choice and enterprise. Before this budget this government held the mantle of the highest taxing government in our history. The origins of this government's record tax take can be traced back to their first four years in office. For four years the government refused to cut taxes. For four long years, as nominal incomes rose, this government did not give a dollar of personal income tax relief. Taxes were ratcheted up on individuals prior to the introduction of the goods and services tax. Personal income taxes as a share of GDP increased from 11.9 to 12.9 per cent of GDP between 1995-96 and 1999-2000. For a single taxpayer on average earnings their average tax rate-that is, the share of their wages lost in tax-jumped from around 24 per cent to 26 per cent. Finally, when the government introduced the GST in 2000-01, it was accompanied by significant income tax cuts. However, they were eroded by the impact of the goods and services tax. After taking into account the impact of the GST and the bracket creep netted between 1996 and 2000, you see this government has been continuing to chase its tail on the personal income tax burden. From 2000-01 to this financial year we have seen four rounds of tax cuts introduced-most incremental. The budget papers show that this year, 200506, personal income tax receipts will amount to 11.8 per cent of GDP. Remember that in 1995-96 the equivalent figure was 11.9 per cent of GDP. I would ask members to reflect on these two figures-10 years and virtually no change in the burden on personal taxpayers. This is indeed a startling fact because in this period we had the GST introduced, so we had virtually no change in the personal not a tax burden plus a 10 per cent GST, which was supposed to have been accompanied by a sustained reduction in personal income taxation. We were told that the introduction of a broad based goods and services tax would reduce our reliance on direct taxation. It did not. So, despite the introduction of the GST, personal income tax in 2005-06 will be as large a share of GDP as it was when the Howard government entered office in 199596. The Treasurer has recently accused the states of double taxation when it comes to the GST, yet these figures make it clear that he stands condemned on his own charge-a common feature of this Treasurer. Personal taxpayers are paying as much tax as they did in 1996 and they now face the additional burden of a GST. Indeed, we know some taxpayers have been paying higher income taxes as well as higher indirect taxes from the GST. That is the double taxation from Treasurer Costello. Higher personal income taxation and a GST-that is his record. An analysis of the government's tax cuts to date shows reductions in average tax rates only for those earning somewhat more than average weekly earnings. If we take someone on the average wage, we know that in 1996 their average tax rate was 24 per cent. This year, 2005-06, their average tax rate will be 24.8 per cent, including the Medicare levy. The difference adds up to about $470 a year. So this is not a government that stands up the battlers when it comes to personal income taxation. When it comes to personal income taxation, they do not defend them; they create them, and that is what ures show. Is it little wonder then that average wage earners in Australia are underwhelmed by their $9.80 weekly tax cuts announced in this year's budget? They are not fools. In contrast to the coalition's approach personal income tax, Labor can claim credit for significant, real personal income tax ductions. When in office Labor delivered seven rounds of tax cuts: on 1 November 1984, 1 December 1986, 1 July 1987, 1 July 1989, 1 January 1990, 1 January 1991, and 15 November 1993. Having inherited a top marginal rate of 60c in the dollar from Treasurer Howard, Labor reduced that to 47c, along with broadening the tax base through the introduction of the fringe benefits tax. A key failing of the Howard government has been its failure to properly integrate personal income tax reform and transfer payment reform. The failure to do this has resulted in the persistence of high effective marginal tax rates and in some cases the worsening of effective marginal tax rates. The OECD has been talking about this for a long time, condemning on many occasions the government's record. According to the OECD annual report Taxing wages, a singleincome family with children, on average earnings, faced an effective marginal tax rate of 35.7 per cent in 1995. This year the same family will face an effective marginal tax rate of 51.5 per cent. That is far higher than the top marginal tax rate experienced by higher income earners. Such a family keeps less than half of their additional earnings, whether it comes from overtime, investment earnings or promotion. So much for the Treasurer's free enterprise! These families do for not give up their weekends or their family time to have Peter Costello's hand so deeply in their pockets that they are losing in excess of half of their additional earnings. That is these fig- this Treasurer's record. So how do the budget tax cuts stack up? Given the background that I have outlined, we are now in a very good position to assess the context and merits of the measures we are debating today. Labor's considered view to is that they are a welcome improvement but they fall far short of addressing many of the re- problems created by our complex and unfair tax system. There is no doubt that the tax cuts we are debating today will deliver some long overdue relief to taxpayers. However, for the most part, taxes on middle-income earners are too high. An analysis of the tax cuts reveals particular improvements for those earning between $25,000 and $35,000 per annum. However, significant relief generally does not flow until an annual income of over $75,000. That said, the distribution of the tax cuts in this budget is fairer than those announced last year. This year, half of the value of the tax cuts are delivered to taxpayers who earn below $50,000 and half to taxpayers who earn above $50,000. In last year's budget, only one-third of the tax cuts went to those earning under $50,000; two-thirds went to those earning over $50,000. This time, taxpayers who earn up to $80,000 a year will gain two-thirds of the tax cuts on offer. A taxpayer on $30,000 gained $17.50 per week from this budget compared with $6 per week in last year's budget. So at least we shamed the government into introducing some greater fairness into the system, although it still has a way to go. Most taxpayers will certainly need every cent that they have received in these tax cuts, if not more, to pay for the recent increases petrol prices and interest rates, and that is before they get to the government's obscene and extreme industrial relations laws. Increases in petrol prices and interest rates could have added more than $20 a week to the expenses of typical households in recent months, and on top of that is the impact of the government's extreme industrial relations changes. I will table our analysis of the tax cuts, which provides all the detail required. That brings us to industrial relations. What is more worrying to households are the government's extreme workplace laws. It is of course impossible to divorce the changes in personal taxation from its recent changes to wage-setting arrangements. The government's intention with its so-called Work Choices policy is to drive down wages and conditions. We have seen that amply demonstrated in this House during question time in recent times. For an example of this, we need only look at the Spotlight situation highlighted yesterday. This parliament has heard that the AWAs offered to workers have stripped them of just about every award condition and offered them just 2c per hour extra for the loss of a large number of conditions. Under the award, an employee working 38 hours a week could earn up to $33,000 a year with penalties. Yet, under the AWA, the same work would result in an annual wage of $28,256. That is a loss of up to $91 a week, an amount that dwarfs the tax cut of just under $20 a week for someone on that income. So average taxpayers out there, and punters working at places such as Spotlight, still have a very high tax burden compared with when this government was first elected. They are facing rising interest rates, they are facing rising petrol prices and now they have this threat to their take-home pay. And this is not an isolated case. Evidence given at the Senate estimates in hearings by the Office of the Employment Advocate suggests that what has occurred with Spotlight is widespread. Something like 6,263 AWAs have been lodged with the OEA since Work Choices commenced on 27 March. Of those AWAs sampled, these are the outcomes: 100 per cent excluded at least one protected award condition; 64 per cent removed leave loadings; 63 per cent removed penalty rates; 52 per cent removed shiftwork loadings; 40 per cent lost gazetted public holidays; and 16 per cent excluded all award conditions and replaced them with the government's legislated minimum standards. With outcomes such as these under the government's new workplace laws it is little wonder that middleand low-income earners are",31
29,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"Order! Member for Lilley, I have read the amendments that you have moved and I would ask you to tie your comments into those amendments.",34
30,Mr SWAN,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"I certainly am, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am talking about the take-home pay of hard working Australians who pay tax and go to work to earn an income that they can live on, and their living standard is a function of what they earn in the workplace and how much tax they pay to the Howard government. At the moment, the miserly tax cuts that many of these lower paid workers were given have been gobbled up by the attack on their wages and working conditions. Nothing could be more pertinent to this bill than those two features of the Howard government's attack on their living conditions. Nothing could be more pertinent to this bill than the impact of tax and its interaction with the government's extreme industrial relations legislation. The tax cuts in this bill for high-income earners are significant-principally, the measure to reduce the top marginal rate from 47c in the dollar to 45c in the dollar above $150,000 per annum. As a consequence of these changes, our top marginal rate is now much closer to the OECD medium. That is a positive outcome from the perspective of having an internationally competitive taxation system, but what is worrying is that the tax cuts for most workers can be swallowed up many times over by the savage assault on their wages and working conditions. That is the point. What is left in the hand after they pay tax on earnings, which are diminishing for the many workers who are subject to vicious AWAs such as we have seen at Spotlight? That brings me to work incentives. Labor believes it is not just the high-income earners who deserve incentive. The tax measures we are debating today fail to systematically address the high effective marginal tax rates that plague our tax transfer payments system. It must be said that most of the elements adopted by the government to ameliorate the worse work disincentives mirror those proposed by Labor over a year ago when there was far less room in the budget for substantive reform. For taxpayers on low incomesthat is, those moving from welfare to work and the many second-income earners-the main change is a new effective tax-free threshold of $10,000, delivered through a new $600 tax offset. This is a big improvement-indeed, we put it forward last yearbut it is worthwhile putting it into perspective with the problem it is trying to address. For taxpayers earning less than $10,000 per annum, effective marginal tax rates fall by up to 15c in the dollar by removing the overlap of tax and withdrawal of cash benefits. However, the taper range for social security allowances and family tax benefit part B extends further, up to roughly $20,000 per annum. Over this income range, an EMTR of around 70c in the dollar can still apply. So, while work incentives are improved for those earning less than $10,000 a year, they remain poor for those earning between $10,000 and $20,000 per annum. That is not a good outcome-nor is it a substantial income. Also blunting the budget's impact on workforce participation is the government's decision not to incorporate the new $600 tax offset in fortnightly PAYG withholdings. Instead, it will only be paid when tax returns are lodged at the end of 2006-07. A lot of people on low incomes are in for a rude shock. They are going to be expecting a fortnightly tax cut, but it is not going to be there. These people face the rising costs of petrol and groceries and the difficulty of getting to work. The cost of all these things keeps going up. The government says, ‘While prices go up on a fortnightly basis, we'll give the offset to you in a lump sum at the end of the year'-as if people want to suspend eating for a year or suspend all other costs for a year. Costs happen regularly. This government has decided in a very mean and narrow way to deliver this tax relief to low-income earners as a lump sum at the end of the financial year, when they need it on a fortnightly basis, during the year, to meet the rising expenses of life. Of course, the government's failure to provide this tax relief on a fortnightly basis will almost certainly reduce any expected behavioural response, as those who stand to benefit will not notice any improvement in their take-home pay each fortnightprecisely when they are making judgments about whether a return to work is worth it. It will be felt especially by mums returning to work who use child care. Out-of-pocket child-care costs often make the biggest dent in their take-home pay, yet the tax relief tained in the budget will not be available each fortnight to help offset it. This is a peat of the debacle of the government's 30 per cent rebate for out-of-pocket child-care costs promised 18 months ago. Not one cent of that rebate will be delivered until after 1 July this year. I do not know whether this government understands how people live-if it provides support solely in one-off payments at the end of the year. Before the budget, Peter Costello's tax system punished mums who work, and that remains the case after the budget. Yesterday at estimates we had confirmation from Treasury officials that the decision not to incorporate the enhanced low-income tax offset into fortnightly tax withholdings will reduce the behavioural impact of the measure. The Treasury itself has admitted that the government's decision to do this on a yearly basis will not enhance workforce participation, which the Treasurer has previously claimed in this House remains the government's No. 1 priority. As usual, the government says one thing and its policy heads entirely in the other direction. This is one example of where the tax measures announced last week fall short of systematically addressing high effective marginal tax rates. Middle-income families will still face a tax grab on extra earnings of 51.5c in the dollar, well above the new top rate of 45c, because the increase in the family tax benefit part A threshold shifts taper zones but does not reduce them. Also, despite the changes in the budget, single-income families with children will still face a staggering EMTR of between 82 and 98.9 per cent on annual incomes between $25,000 and $35,000. For a family-and this is a stunning figure which shows the narrowness and meanness of the Howard government-on $25,000 a year, conthese absurd disincentives mean they will keep less than $800 of a $10,000 per year reincrease in earnings. If that were happening to high-income earners in this community, there would be a riot. This government is very strong in taxing people on low incomes and handing out punishing disincentives but very weak in delivering the reforms that are required to enhance participation and deliver sustained financial security to families who are struggling to balance work and family life. That brings me to capital depreciation measures, a positive measure in the bill we are debating today. Most assets are now depreciated on the basis of their effective life. This means that the Commissioner of Taxation describes the effective life of an asset to be over when the asset can be written off. Two methods are generally available: the prime cost method, which divides the cost equally over each year of an asset's life; and the diminishing value method, which allows a taxpayer to claim a deduction of 150 per cent of the written-down value of the asset. Under the pre-budget rules, the deduction in the first year is 150 per cent of the prime cost value and in the second year it is 150 per cent of the residual value-that is, the purchase price less the write-off in the first year. Although the asset is depreciated more rapidly in the earlier years, the same net reduction applies over the effective life of the asset. The government has now increased the rate for the diminished value method to 200 per cent so that deductions will be even more front-end loaded over the life of the asset. This is effectively a form of accelerated depreciation. Labor supports it given the importance of capital deepening in boosting productivity. There was certainly significant scope in this budget to embark on a process of significant and staged tax reform. When the Treasurer released his Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in December, it projected budget surpluses of $42 billion over four years. By the time the Treasurer delivered the budget three weeks ago, the budget envelope, before any new tax or spending measures had been announced, had swelled to $93 billion over the same period. As jackpots go, that is a huge increase-an increase over the period from December to May of $51 billion. Never before has a Treasurer been presented with such an opportunity to shape our economic future. In the area of tax, the option was certainly open to the Treasurer to announce significant and staged reform, and he did not. There was no vision-no plan for where our tax system should be in 10 years; no plan to fix, once and for all, the high effective marginal tax rates that are holding back workforce participation and undermining the financial well-being of too many families in our community; and no proposals to simplify the tax system or make it fairer. Despite the positive and long overdue measures in this bill, middle Australians are still taxed very heavily. When they put in they do not necessarily get enough back. Families who work hard and try to get ahead deserve to see some reward from their efforts. This is particularly the case for second-income earners, who often re-enter the workforce to help pay off the mortgage or meet school fees. A couple of weeks before the budget, the Treasurer said in a speech to the National Press Club that he wanted to see Australian society and the Australian workforce become the most female-friendly in the world. What we actually see, with the continuation of these high effective marginal tax rates and the fact that they have been made worse in some cases in this budget, is a Treasurer who operates a tax system which is one of the most unfriendly to females in the Western world. When second-income earners, who are principally women, lose anywhere between 50c and 80c of every additional dollar they earn, these high tax grabs really slug the female workforce, who predominantly earn less than men, who are predominantly looking for better hours of work which are family friendly, who frequently have less choice about how they do that work and who frequently face much greater stress in trying to place their kids in affordable care or in some arrangement which is consistent with their work hours. It is simply obscene when the Treasurer goes to the Press Club and claims he wants to make our tax system and our society the most female friendly in the world and then leaves in place a tax system which punishes their additional participation in the workforce when they want to do a few extra hours to help the family to get ahead, to buy the school uniforms or to set themselves up to deal with the educational expenses of their kids-to do that something extra for their family to move ahead. The government has designed a tax system which really hits those people for six. So there can be no false claims about the government being female friendly when it comes to tax or society more generally. That is particularly also the case when you look at what is occurring, or not occurring, in child care. We can see the broad sweep of what is happening with their extreme industrial relations changes and how the people who are going to suffer most and first and hardest are those low-income earners, predominantly women who are not necessarily working full time. This government cannot claim to be family friendly when you combine the impact of the IR laws and the tax burden, particularly on middleand low-income earners, over the life of the government. The government cannot claim to be friendly to lowand middle-income earners and certainly cannot claim to be all that friendly to families. And they most certainly cannot claim to be female friendly when it comes to taxation. It is not good enough that they have left place a system where second-income earners lose 60c, 70c or 80c out of each dollar of their additional earnings. Further tax reductions along with child-care reforms are needed to improve incentives for secondincome earners. Such reductions will also benefit individuals moving from welfare to work, who also face high effective marginal tax rates of 70 per cent or more. That is a whole story in itself-what the government is doing to people who are attempting to stand on their own two feet by moving from welfare to work. They are attacking their incomes, not just through the industrial relations system but through some very mean, narrow and ultimately unproductive changes to the welfare system which will really punish many people in vulnerable situations. In a sense, this bill sums up so much of what is wrong with the Howard government. Its failure to invest for the future by not troducing the incentive into the tax system that is required, along with its failure vest in the skills of our workforce and the education of our kids and our future workers, sums up so much of what is wrong with the government. If we do not attend to these problems, prosperity for this country well into the future cannot be guaranteed. If we are going to guarantee prosperity for the future, we have to invest in it. We have to put incentive in the tax system to enhance participation. The Treasurer's budget speech did not mention the word ‘participation' even once, and you can see why when you see the sort of perverse outcomes that still remain in the system despite the once-in-a-generation opportunity the Treasurer had to fix up these problems. That is why I have moved the amendments circulated in my name.",34
31,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,Is the amendment seconded?,38
32,Mr ALBANESE,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"I second the amendment. The fact is that the highest marginal tax rates in this country are paid by people moving from welfare to work. The latest budget failed to address that. When there can be a 70 per cent loss on additional earnings of people moving from welfare to work, you have a situation which is long overdue to be addressed. We hear a lot of rhetoric about this government being family friendly. That is why this amendment to the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006 seeks to point out that the government has simply failed when it comes to addressing issues of workforce participation. Despite the fact that there are some improvements contained in this bill, the government has not addressed three primary issues: firstly, second earners, most particularly women moving into the workforce, still incontinue to suffer extremely high marginal tax rates; secondly, individuals who move to infrom welfare into work are punished; and, thirdly, middleand low-income families with dependent children also can suffer extremely high marginal tax rates. When those issues are combined with the failure of the government to address accessibility and affordability of child care and to take into account that it is families and low-income people who are being put under pressure from the extreme industrial relations changes that the government has made, they indicate that the government should support this second reading amendment moved by my colleague the shadow Treasurer, the member for Lilley, and I commend the amendment to the House.",38
33,Mr KEENAN,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"Stirling) (10.31 am)There is not a lot that I admire about the member for Lilley, although in this instance I do admire his front. We have just heard him accusing the government of a litany of sins in the midst of the most sustained economic growth in this nation's history. This expansion has been created in large part by the policies of this government-policies that were opposed at every stage by the Australian Labor Party. The shadow Treasurer accused the Treasurer of lacking policy vision by not outlining the nature of the tax system or how the tax system will look in a decade's time. This is from a shadow Treasurer who has trouble articulating an economic policy for the ALP for next week and from a shadow Treasurer of a party that has comprehensively failed over the past 10 years to outline any coherent economic or fiscal policy at all. In speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006, I am pleased to report that the Treasurer recently took time out from his busy post-budget tour of Australia to officially open my new electorate office in Stirling. (Quorum formed) I had mistakenly assumed that the Labor Party had learnt from last year's experience of ing to block personal tax cuts, but obviously they have not. Let the record reflect that they tried to close this House down whilst the government was introducing this round of personal tax cuts. What is it about tax cuts that the Australian Labor Party hates so much? Mr Deputy Speaker, I can tell you that the people in my electorate of Stirling are very pleased with this year's budget. When the Treasurer came on his post-budget tour to open my electorate office, he received a rousing welcome from local community leaders, families and business owners. The people of Stirling know that real and practical benefits will come out of this year's budget. The Treasurer's visit only reiterated that this budget will continue to build on the policies that have been put in place over the past decade by the government to ensure that our economy remains strong. One of the things at the heart of this strategy is personal tax reduction-putting more money into people's pay packets-and another is improving the taxation arrangements for business so that investment and growth are encouraged. This bill has several purposes: to reduce personal income tax rates, to increase the low-income tax offset and to decrease the amount of Medicare levy paid by lowincome senior Australians. It also increases deductions of the decline in value of the depreciating business assets under the diminishing value method. The measures contained in this bill will cut personal income tax for all Australians from 1 July this year. These tax cuts are another step along the road of comprehensive tax reform-a process that was started after the election of 1998 and has provided personal income tax cuts for Australians in the years 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005. From 1 July this year the government will try- reduce the 47 per cent and 42 per cent tax rates to 45 per cent and 40 per cent respectively. This reduction will build on the cuts already made to lower income rates over the years, most recently in last year's budget. In addition, the government will increase the thresholds so that the 15 per cent tax rate will apply up to $25,000 of income, the 30 per cent rate will apply up to $75,000 of income, the 40 per cent rate will apply up to $150,000 of income and the 45 per cent rate will apply to income earned after that. Under the workings of this bill, the government will cut the fringe benefits tax rate from 48.5 per cent to 46.5 per cent to bring it into line the top marginal tax rate, including the Medicare levy. The low-income tax offset will be enhanced by increasing it from $235 to $600. It will begin to phase out at $25,000 from 1 July this year, compared to $21,600 currently. This means that those eligible for the full low-income tax offset will not pay tax until their annual income exceeds $10,000. The Medicare levy low-income phase-in rate will be cut from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, which ensures that low-income taxpayers pay a reduced rate of Medicare levy. Australians who are eligible for the senior Australians tax offset will now pay no tax on their annual income up to $24,867 for singles and up to $41,360 for couples. Overall, the greatest tax cuts have been provided to low-income earners. This is a point that seems to have been lost on the Labor Party, so I repeat for their benefit that those who pay small amounts of tax cannot receive huge tax cuts on an overall basis. These tax changes will ensure that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers face a top marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less. The increase in the 30 per cent threshold and the low-income tax offset will provide more incentives for those outside the workforce to re-enter it and for those in part-time work to work additional hours. This is vitally important. We must always strive to make sure that we create a system that puts someone in a job in a stronger position than they would be if they were on welfare. Under these new arrangements, a taxpayer will need to earn $121,000 to pay an average tax rate of 30 per cent. From 1 July this year the top marginal tax rate will apply to only two per cent of taxpayers. Taxpayers will not reach the highest marginal rate until they earn more than three times average weekly earnings. When this is compared to other with OECD countries, reducing the top marginal tax rate and increasing the top threshold will bolster the competitiveness of Australia's tax system. This bill will put Australia's top marginal tax rate in line with the OECD average and the increase in the top threshold will place Australia as the 10th highest in the OECD. Mr Ciobo-Fantastic!",39
34,Mr KEENAN,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"This is very good news. Six years ago the threshold for the top marginal tax rate stood at $50,000. If the threshold for the top marginal rate had been indexed when this government came to office in 1996, as it was under the previous government, it would now stand at only $64,000. Through previous reforms and this bill, by 1 July this year the threshold will be $150,000. (Quorum formed) Again, let the record show that the Australian Labor Party wants to close this House down whilst the government is trying to pass personal tax cuts. This package provides $36.7 billion of benefit to Australian taxpayers over four years and it reinforces our reputation as a low-tax country. These tax cuts significantly restructure the personal income tax system to increase disposable incomes, to enhance incentives for participation and to improve Australia's international competitiveness. Australian workers are set to benefit from these personal income tax cuts that will put much needed cash back into their pockets. In my electorate of Stirling this will mean that more than 50,000 workers on average wages can expect to get up to $40 in tax savings each month and around 25,000 workers in my electorate who are on higher incomes can expect to save up to $80 each month. This is an important saving for local workers. More money in people's pockets gives them more choices and allows them to start making plans for the future. Workers can choose to save these deductions or they can use them just to help pay the bills. I have heard some talk from the opposition of bracket creep in this debate. I think we need to reiterate the point that 80 per cent of tralians are on taxable incomes of less than $75,000. As people move up in income, they do not automatically move to a higher marginal tax rate under these new arrangements. The great bulk of people will move through the income range from $25,000 to $75,000 without altering their marginal tax rate. In fact, under these reforms, as I have said before, only two per cent of Australians will have taxable incomes over $150,000. There is more to be done in the area of tax, but it has been noted by organisations such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry that these changes are a good start for future tax reform. The Business Council of Australia has stated that the changes to the personal tax system will provide additional incentives to work and to save. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you look at the tax cuts in the context of what has happened over the past five years, this is just another part of a long-term strategy that has been implemented by this government. This is the fifth instalment of personal tax cuts, and there is more room for adjustment and reform in the future. The structure of our tax system is a vitally important element to create our national prosperity. Get the tax system wrong and you rob people of incentives to work. You rob them of the opportunity to work harder to earn more. Tax cuts are all about giving people incentives. They are about encouraging people to work overtime, to work harder, to study, to push for advancement and to try and earn a better life for themselves and their families. Tax cuts are about giving people choices and about improving the quality of people's lives. At a local level, I would hope that this reinvigoration will have a positive ripple effect. Under this bill, the big winners will also be our small businesses. In my electorate of AusStirling we have a thriving small business network, with the Stirling Business Association being one of the biggest organisations of its kind in Australia. We also have important research and development organisations, across all fields, from aviation technology to cancer drug research. This bill will implement the budget measure which substantially improves Australia's depreciation arrangements by increasing the diminishing value rate for determining depreciation deductions from 150 per cent to 200 per cent. This will cut business taxes by $3.7 billion over the next four years. The effect of the measure will be to provide the equivalent of a 33 per cent increase in the allowable depreciation rate for all eligible assets. This is going to increase incentives for Australian businesses to invest in new plant and equipment and it will make it easier to keep pace with new technology and remain internationally competitive. Investment is a key element of productivity growth and, therefore, of economic growth. These changes are consistent with the government's tax policy strategy of making sure that the tax system has a minimal effect on the allocation of resources in the economy. The measure will apply to assets acquired on or after 10 May this year and includes appropriate integrity measures to ensure assets held prior to that date are not able to be brought into the new arrangements. This means that, under the new depreciation arrangements, businesses can write off eligible assets at an accelerated depreciation rate on their diminishing value-allowing for higher deductions in the early part of the asset's life and increasing their new present value. This accelerated allowance is offering incentives for businesses to invest in plant and equipment to improve their overall operations. In my electorate of Stirling I would like to think that a healthy level of business investment will be reached in the coming year, as small business owners make the most of these amendments that are designed to assist them to grow their business. This bill is a help to all Australians. It redistributes taxation revenues and increases the disposable income of all Australian taxpayers. It increases incentives for people to undertake additional work or to start a new business and increases productivity and employment throughout the whole economy. As we are not a low-wage economy, increasing capital investment is an important way for us to remain competitive in world export markets. The reduction in the phase-in rate for the Medicare levy for low-income earners reduces the impact of this levy on the most vulnerable sector of our community. This bill is another chapter in the progress that has been made over the last 10 years. It is part of one of the biggest investing budgets inG this country for a long time. And what a budget it was. I will just take a moment to remind the House of what it contained: a tax cut for every single Australian, a plan to simplify and slash taxes on superannuation and improvements that encourage businesses to invest and grow. This budget continues to build on the policies that have been put in place over the past decade to keep our economy strong. None of the generous tax cuts, the radical slashing of taxation on superannuation, the record spending on defence and national security, the massive investments in our road, rail and water infrastructure would be possible without the prudent management that has been displayed by the coalition since 1996. It would not have been possible to introduce this bill into the House or to have such a generous 11th budget without having had the previous 10 budgets that have steered Australia into the current economic good times. This bill, which delivers to taxpayers the surplus revenue the government has collected, is a vitally important part of that strategy. This bill is about taking the opportunity now to strengthen our economy for future opportunities and future challenges. I surplus commend it to the House. (Time expired)",40
35,Mr FITZGIBBON,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,I am delighted to see that the member for Moncrieff is following me in this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006 because we all recall very vividly the member for Moncrieff having a bit to say about taxation reform prior to the delivery of this year's budget. It will be very interesting to see whether the member for Moncrieff is satisfied with the tax cuts being presented to the House. Mr Ciobo-Very satisfied.,42
36,Mr FITZGIBBON,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"He says, ‘Very satisfied.' That interests me because I recall very well the contributions made by the member for Moncrieff prior to the budget. I am not so sure they now align with what is being delivered in these tax cuts. Let us not have any gilding of the lily, Member for Moncrieff. You should maintain your independence. You have done so in the past. You should maintain your independence and share with the House and the Australian people your real view about this tax package and the extent to which it conforms to your prebudget contributions and where you would have the Treasurer change his tax package to better align it with the views you expressed earlier. I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Given that the ernment is absolutely awash with moneynot as a result of anything it has done in nomic terms but because of the resources boom this country is currently enjoying-we should not have been surprised in that context to see the government come up with a $37 billion tax cut plan over the coming four years. I suspect most Australians will be happy with those tax cuts. Why would they not be? They are long overdue. But I suspect some will be happier than others. For example, if a family's private income is $70,000, the tax cut, combined with family benefits, will be about $25 a week. Much happier will be those on private incomes of around $150,000 where the combined effect of family tax benefit changes and income tax cuts will be around $119 a week. The extent of happiness will of course vary from household to household. I suspect that is why the government has not received the boost it was hoping for in public polling in response to the budget. Of course, happiness will also be measured by one's situation in life. If you approaching 60, or are just past 60, you will be very happy with the proposed super changes. If you are a small business person around the age of 56 and you were hoping to inject some capital into your super fund as a means of saving for your future, I suspect that, because of the cap proposed to be introduced, you will be somewhat happy. As I make my contribution, I want to reflect on the tax cuts, I want to reflect on they were designed and how they were funded and I want to reflect on the government's forecast-the basis on which the government is reassuring, if you like, the Australian people that these tax cuts were affordable. Prior to the budget the case for wholesale reform of Australia's taxation system was absolutely compelling. Our system lacks both vertical and horizontal equity, is excesgov- sively complex and no doubt is a brake on economic growth. Individual taxpayers were ecopaying too much, ridiculous compliance burdens were killing small business and poor interaction between individual, company and capital gains tax systems posed a serious threat to our future prosperity. At the coalface, serious questions were being raised about the way the Australian Taxation Office deals with individual taxpayers and some small business entities. People were calling for regulation to be simplified-radically reduced, not just pruned at the edges. There is no doubt our tax system is a cumbersome giant tripping over its own heels. The question today for the House is: were any of those issues dealt with in this budget tax cut measure? The first priority for repair and redesign of the personal tax area is critical. The way that rates and thresholds are structured results in the tax burden on the average employee being unjustifiably high. The economy-wide effects of a high tax burden on labour are very significant. The first are effect is the disincentive for labour market participation. The second effect is that the incentive for labour productivity growth is curtailed. Labour productivity ultimately flows through into higher wages, but if they are too highly taxed then the rewards for innovation and better workplace outcomes are weakened. The third effect is a reduction in our competitiveness. High rates tend to reduce Australia's capacity to compete for how skilled labour. This will ultimately reduce productivity and, of course, has also led to the regime this government now has in place to import labour from other countries rather than giving Australians an opportunity. One aspect of the tax debate which is misguided is the assumption that the majority of these economic benefits will necessarily flow from tax reform at the top end of the income scale. Indeed, the combination of tax cuts and family payment systems has become a potpourri of disincentives. The burden of these disincentive traps fall most unfairly on lower income earners, especially sole parents, who are lucky to retain $1 in every $4 from a wage increase. This is the prime reason why Australia's labour market participation rates lag behind those of our international competitors, especially the United States. The personal tax system remains too complex. Growth in deductions is rapidly outpacing growth in revenue. How is this explained? This is further evidence that the review of aspects of the personal work related deduction system is long overdue-and I think the member for Moncrieff agrees with me on that point. Tax returns are far too onerous. The government should consider a tick-the-box type of approach so that taxpayers can be set free from the complexity of the current system. Major problems also exist outside the personal tax area. The small business sector continues to face crippling compliance burdens which eat into its capacity to innovate. Differential rates in company, personal and capital gains tax distort economic incentives. Treatment of tax losses discourages investment in exploration and venture capital. Tax legislation and administrative practice has been poor in recent years. At least 13 flawed tax measures were introduced into the parliament during 2005 alone. Treasury's record in providing regulatory impact statements is notoriously bad, as the Productivity Commission has pointed out. Where explanations of new law are provided, they are not in plain English and are often inaccurately costed. Simplification is a major challenge and cannot be properly tackled with halfbaked measures. The lesson of history is that such attempts to simplify tax law tend to have the perverse effect of increasing complexity. Now that the legislation has exploded to 9,000 pages, the plan to cut 2,000 redundant pages now looks a little bit less than ambitious. The government must begin a serious program of simplifying and consolidating operative provisions. Maybe they should look to the UK system of targeted reductions in business regulation. The ATO is performing below par. For example, the overly aggressive approach to the handling of small business tax debts is a real worry. This approach led to more than 2,000 small business bankruptcies last year alone. The tax inspector's call for a more case-bycase approach is well justified, and I support it. It may be time to look at a US style loans guarantee program for small business. Some people say that this produces a new lender of last resort. At the moment the tax office is the lender of last resort, and with it comes painfully high general interest charges on debt. Why not shift the lender of last resort option to a semi-government agency, for example, which would charge a risk premium but which, rather than make taxpayers guilty of breaches of the act, would allow small business taxpayers a better option? In the United States this is a revenue positive initiative. A small business person goes to the bank looking for a short-term loan to deal with a short-term cash flow issue and the bank looks at the numbers, decides it is just outside its risk guidelines and passes it on to the Office of Small Business Administration. The Office of Small Business Administration looks at it and says, ‘Yes, we will back this loan to the tune of 75 per cent.' On that basis the bank lends the small business the money. The premiums raised by the Office of Small Business Administration are in excess of the cost of the very few defaults it suffers as a result of the program. It would be better to have some government agency assisting small business through cash flow difficulties than having the tax office fill role of lender of last resort, with punitive penalties for loans. The banks are very good at knocking back small business for shortterm loans to deal with cash flow issues$20,000 to $30,000-but the same banks are very good at sending the same small business person an offer in the mail the next day to extend their credit card limit to some $20,000 or $30,000. This is an inconsistency on the part of the banking sector. The tax system is the primary driver of centives in our economy. When it does not fit together neatly, harmoniously and simply, consumers and investors face increased uncertainty and high transaction costs. This is a brake on economic growth. Genuine tax reform is needed to lift workforce participation and productivity to the levels of our competitors. This will lead to increases in growth and per capita GDP. We need to realise that Australia will not bridge the gap between Australian and US GDP per capita with the current tax system. That was the pre-budget situation. These were the things that business peak representative bodies and economists around the country were asking for. The question again is: were those voices heard in terms of this tax package and were those goals achieved? If you acknowledge for a moment that there were some reductions in personal tax cuts, the overwhelming answer has to be no. The Treasurer does not seem to understand that there is a difference between tax cuts and tax reform. It is not a very difficult concept to comprehend. The Treasurer consistently says in public that there is no difference. I know the member for Moncrieff will agree with me on this point when he rises to his feet, because he has said so publicly himself. Tax cuts obviously reduce the individual's tax burden by raising thresholds or reducing rates. That is simple. Anyone can the surely understand that concept. Tax reform improves the efficiency of the tax system. It restores vertical and horizontal equity to the tax system. It reduces the compliance impact of the tax system. But we saw none of that in this budget, and there is none of that in the bill before the parliament today. I turn to the second point I want to make, and that is how this package is funded. I have already talked about the windfall from the resources boom. That is how these tax in- cuts are being funded. But, as any first-year economics student knows, we are taking a short-term windfall, a temporary windfall, to pay for an ongoing commitment. These tax cuts do not just have effect this year, next year and in three years time. They have an effect ad infinitum, until the law is changed again. But the windfall is temporary. Mr Ciobo-So you're opposed to them?",42
37,Mr FITZGIBBON,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"Economics 101, I say to the member for Moncrieff. Let me tell the House how these tax cuts should have been funded. These tax cuts are long overdue, and Labor support them; we have indicated that. We think they could have been designed better, but Labor support these long overdue tax cuts designed to compensate people for the higher interest rates, higher petrol prices, higher private insurance costs and all of those things which are hitting families every day. Of course we support them-in distributional terms they are much fairer than those proposed in last year's budget. But they should have been funded out of the proceeds of our productivity gains over the last decade-the productivity gains we have not made. When Labor left office we were enjoying productivity growth of around three per cent. In more recent times it has been between one and 1.5 per cent. This is a real issue for Australia. As Paul Keating is still fond of if you have wages growth at four per cent and productivity at three per cent, it leaves one per cent for inflation-pretty simple arithmetic. But if you have wages growing at four per cent and productivity at only one per cent, it leaves three per cent for inflation. Labor broke the back of the inflation bogy but this government is bringing it back as a result of its failure on the productivity front. That is why the Reserve Bank governor has his finger poised on the higher interest rate button. This is a government that went to an election promising to hold interest rates at their current levels. Every time the Prime Minister appeared publicly he was behind a lectern which had written on the front of it ‘Keeping interest rates low'. But that will not be the case-firstly, because these cuts should have been funded out of productivity gains and were not and, secondly, because we are putting a heap of money into consumption, which is in itself inflationary. Our high level of foreign debt is still too much directed to private consumption instead of productivity improvements. Mr Ciobo interjecting",45
38,Mr FITZGIBBON,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"If the member for Moncrieff disagrees with that, I invite him to put his case and argue it well when he rises to speak after me. I think he will struggle on that case. How can he argue against the proposition that tax cuts will put pressure on interest rates in an environment where the government has dropped the ball on productivity gains? Is he going to deny that productivity is hovering around one to 1½ per cent? I will listen with great interest to what he to say, because I know he does not have any argument whatsoever. He knows that a golden opportunity has been lost, and the Treasurer knows that a golden opportunity has been lost. This takes me to the issue of forecasting. saying, Members of the House might have been reading the Financial Review with some interest over the last couple of days because, in the Senate estimates process, Labor have been doing a little bit of a teasing out of their own to try to determine what is going on in this area of forecasting. Something very strange is happening. While there was no increase in the company tax rate, for example, in the budget, the effective tax rate on companies is actually increasing. Chris Richardson from Access Economics made the point that something strange is happening when company revenue is growing at 18 per cent and company profits are growing at 12 per cent. We challenge the Treasurer when summing up this debate to tell us the basis on which his projections on company tax revenue are made. It is pretty simple. These increases in company tax receipts are critical to funding the tax cuts, and I think it is appropriate for the Treasurer, given the uncertainty that has been raised in Senate estimates this week, to tell us what is happening. He should tell us specifically why it is that the budget is getting an 18 per cent increase in company tax receipts, while company profits are growing by only 12 per cent. He might come in here and say: ‘This is very easy to explain. Companies, particularly mining companies, over the last year or so have been investing heavily in additional capacity to try to catch up with demand, particularly in China.' That would explain why there would be a disparity in the figures. Labor say, ‘If that's the reason, we accept has the explanation.' But nowhere in the budget papers are we given any such explanation. So the Treasurer, in closing the debate, has to explain why it is that we have company receipts growing at 18 per cent and company profits growing at only 12 per cent. As I said, if it is as a result of heavier deductions which flow from the additional investment in productive capacity, we would be satisfied with that answer. But if the Treasurer says, ‘No, that's not what it is about,' can he tell us what it is about? It is a new phenomenon, one we have not been familiar with in the past, and I think the Australian people are entitled to an explanation. These revenue forecasts are so important, and of course we all know that revenue forecasting can be manipulated for political gain. Senator Watson in Senate estimates hearings yesterday made the point that it is possible that real and meaningful wholesale tax reform might have been overlooked because of conservative revenue forecasts. Maybe it is time to take a US style approach and have an independent agency do the forecasting on behalf of the government, or look at the UK model of having, in parallel, an institute funded by the government also measuring these forecasts to keep the government of the day honest. (Time expired)",46
39,Mr CIOBO,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Hunter and, more broadly, the Australian Labor Party, especially when the member for Hunter spent a great deal of his time talking about economics 101. Those of us on the government benches always take great interest whenever the Australian Labor Party try to lecture this government on economics 101. The Australian Labor Party, as a testament to their fundamental and comprehensive understanding of economics, left our country with $96 billion of debt, an unemployment rate that reached 11 per cent-one million unemployed Australians-and interest rates that required servicing at 17 per cent or 18 per cent. Yet, despite this track record of the Australian Labor Party, the member for Hunter comes into the chamber and says: ‘Economics 101 says that this government has made all these mistakes. We're not doing this right; we're not doing that right.' So, fundamentally, we should in some way be listening to the advice that comes from the Australian Labor Party rather than looking at our government's track record. In rising to speak to the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006 I am pleased to highlight to the opposition the strength of this government's performance on taxation. I have been, as the member for Hunter outlined, a strong advocate within government for tax reform. I am proud of my advocacy in calling for there to be reduced levels of both corporate and personal taxation. I am also proud of the fact that the Treasurer has listened to calls that I and others have made. In the budget the Treasurer delivered some $37 billion worth of tax cuts. In large part, this is because of his own leadership when it comes to ensuring that the Australian economy remains strong and, at the same time, ensuring that the Australian people enjoy those benefits. (Quorum formed) We see the Labor Party's form: once again, the Australian Labor Party comes in and starts lecturing with its dodgy Labor economics but then, when the government comes into reinforce the efforts it has made to keep the Australian economy strong, the reaction of the Australian Labor Party is to suddenly call a quorum. I am not surprised that the Australian Labor Party feels it necessary to call a quorum because it is very clear that the Australian Labor Party would rather keep a cap on its very bad track record when it comes to economic management and try to prevent a government member from highlighting our track record. I would like to turn back to comments that the member for Hunter made. The member for Hunter, who is a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, made reference to the fact that the tax cuts that were announced by the Treasurer were, to use his words, ‘long overdue tax cuts that the Australian Labor Party supported'. Indeed, we have seen the Labor Party say that, unlike in previous years, are not going to vote against these tax cuts. But then, shortly thereafter, the member for Hunter said, ‘We shouldn't be having these tax cuts, because they are placing undue pressure on interest rates.' So, on the one hand, the member for Hunter says they support these long overdue tax cuts but, on the other hand, the member for Hunter says: ‘These tax cuts are going to put upwards pressure on interest rates. We shouldn't be having these tax cuts.' So we see once again the flip-flop of the Australian Labor Party, trying to argue one way and then in the very next breath trying to argue the other way. I would remind the member for Hunter, because he sits on the House of Representatives economics committee, that the Reserve Bank governor when he last appeared before the committee made it very clear under questioning by the member for Rankin that tax cuts that kept the budget surplus between one and 1½ per cent of GDP would not place undue pressure on monetary policy. The Reserve Bank governor himself made it very clear that tax cuts would not place pressureMr Fitzgibbon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The governor made clear that that was because the government each year was only returning the proceeds of bracket creep and, therefore, there was no net effect.",47
40,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,The member for Hunter will resume his seat. He knows that is not a point of order.,48
41,Mr CIOBO,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"A point of order that was only equalled by the contribution by the member for Hunter earlier. Nonetheless, the Reserve Bank governor did make it clear that, provided that the surplus remained between one and 1½ per cent of GDP, there they would not be upward pressure on monetary policy. That is exactly what this budget does. It is the Australian coalition-in particular, the Treasurer, Peter Costello-that is able through careful economic management to deliver some $37 billion worth of tax cuts to the Australian people. Irrespective of whether you are a more lowly paid worker in Australia, whether you are a middle-class Australian or whether you earn a higher income in this country, you will enjoy tax cuts as a result of this careful economic management by the Treasurer, Peter Costello, and more broadly by the Howard government. With respect to other comments that were made, I notice that the member for Hunter said, and I quote him exactly: ‘Labor has broken the back of the inflation bogy.' How did it do that? How was it that the Australian Labor Party brought the inflation rate down? The answer is quite apparent and quite straightforward: the Australian Labor Party did it by having the ‘recession that we had to have'. You would remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that at the time the Australian Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who prior to that was the Australian Treasurer-the man responsible for the recession we had to have-broke it the back of inflation by throwing one million Australians onto the unemployment scrap heap, by driving interest rates up to 18 per cent, by not delivering tax cuts and by making sure that all Australians were penalised by the incompetence of the former Labor government. That is how the Australian Labor Party broke the back of inflation in this country. I can guarantee one thing: the people of my electorate of Moncrieff, the people of my city of the Gold Coast and the Australian people more broadly will never, ever want to go back to an Australian Labor Party that achieves some kind of success with respect to inflation by throwing a million Australians on the unemployment scrap heap, by driving up interest rates and by making sure that Australians pay a very heavy price indeed for low inflation. What Australians want is the kind of economic responsibility that Peter Costello as Treasurer has been able to deliver, the kind of responsibility that has seen our unemployment rate down at around five per cent-the lowest level that it has been for decades. They like the fact that the Australian economy is enjoying strong productivity growth, because they know that, with an increase in the participation rate, there is to be a flattening-out of productivity growth in terms of actual statistics. As you have more people coming into the workforce and more Australians off the unemployment queues, which this government has been able to achieve-and the Australian Labor Party knows this-they know that the reflections of productivity growth will not be large in percentage but that, when spread across that vast bulk of people moving into employment, there is strong productivity growth in the Australian labour force. But, more importantly, it has been conceded as part of this debate that the Australian economy-which is now enjoying, as I said, decades-low levels of unemployment-is being super competitive. The member for Hunter also made reference to the fact that the taxation system is indeed a barometer for the attractiveness of the Australian economy and the incentive mechanism that it uses. If that is the case, if the taxation system provides some clear indication of the level of incentive in the Australian economy, it is very clear that there is strong incentive. The reason there is strong incentive is the same reason that we have Australians coming back from overseas and working in this country. (Quorum formed) No wonder the Australian Labor Party languishes in the polls, because the people in the public galleries can see the stunts that the Australian Labor Party is engaging in. They see the fact that the Australian Labor Party has no relevance to ordinary Australians and so it engages in these kinds of stunts on an ongoing basis. I am not surprised that the Australian Labor Party languishes in the polls, because it has no relevance, it has no credibility when it comes to economics and it quite simply has no sense of what is important to the Australian people. There is nothing more important to the Australian people going than knowing that they can have a strong family, and a key plank of having a strong family is knowing they have enough money left in their pockets at the end of the working week to provide for their family. The bill before the House does exactly that, and they know that as a consequence of this bill going through the House there will be more money in their pockets come 1 July than there would be if the Australian Labor Party were in government, and they are grateful for it. The Labor Party, including the member for Hunter, as I said, have also said that the tax system is the driver of incentive. So the Labor Party say the tax system is the driver of incentive and yet they voted against tax cuts. In the previous budget we saw tax cuts being delivered to the Australian people. We had a lecture from the member for Hunter, and no doubt the member for Rankin will also lecture us about economic policy. So we have these people from the Australian Labor Party talking about how the tax system is the driver of incentive in the Australian economy and yet, despite this fact, the Australian Laing rapidly. bor Party voted against tax cuts. The inescapable conclusion is that Labor prefers taxes to be higher. Indeed, we see member for Hunter talking about this in direct conflict with the member for Lilley. We heard the member for Hunter asking why it is that growth in deductions is rapidly outgrowing growth in revenue and how this growth in deductions is of concern, yet the member for Lilley earlier on in this debate came into the chamber and spoke at length about how he thought that this government was one of the biggest taxing governments in Australia's history. So on the one hand the ALP member for Hunter says, ‘We're concerned that the growth in deductions is outpacing the growth in revenue,' and the member for Lilley, on the other hand, says, ‘We've got so much revenue growth under this government that we should be holding them to account.' So once again, as we saw previously, there is the flip and the flop of the Australian Labor Party. With one breath they say one thing and with the next breath they say something else. The simple reality that the Australian Labor Party will say anything, will do anything, in some attempt to deceive the Australian people into voting for them so that they can end up back on the government benches. There was another question that the member for Hunter raised. He spoke about why it is that company revenues are up 18 per cent yet company profits are only up 12 per cent. He said that, if the Treasurer was able to dicate that this was a consequence of investment in plant and equipment, a growing of capacity in the Australian economy, he would be comfortable with it. That is a very large part of what is driving these numbers. There is no doubt about it. We have seen capacity growth in business capital investment across the Australian economy expandBut there is another point which should be mentioned, and that is the fact that Australia the today is a much more competitive marketplace, so you can get increased revenue growth in companies by having increased volume but lower margins, which of course will help to reduce profits. So the reality is that we are still getting strong profit growth in the corporate sector. We are still getting strong corporate growth, but Australians are benefiting from a more open, more competitive economy, and that is also part of the reason why we see company revenues growing by 18 per cent but company profits growing by only 12 per cent. That is not a bad set of numbers at all, and it is one that all Australians will enjoy the benefits of. In drawing to a close-given the few minutes I have because the Labor Party called two quorums-I would like to touch on a couple of other aspects. The Gold Coast, the area and the wonderful city that I have the pleasure of representing, is the small business capital of Australia. On a per capita is basis, we have the highest concentration of small businesses in this country. I am very pleased by and proud of the entrepreneurial spirit that residents of my electorate have. I am pleased they are willing to roll up their sleeves and go out there and make a buck, and I support them at every opportunity. I was very pleased and delighted that this year the National Franchise and Small Business Convention gave me the federal politician of in the year award. I will continue to be a strong advocate for small businesses in my electorate and a strong advocate in making sure that they can continue to make a buck. I am proud to be part of a government that makes it easier for businesses to make a dollar. In this respect, I am also pleased that, as a result of the increased depreciation rates that the government announced in this year's budget, businesses will enjoy increased cash flow. What's more, we can expect some of the personal tax cuts in this year's budget to flow through the economy and into the tills of Australian businesses. Turning to those tax cuts, this bill will see the government increase the thresholds so that the 15 per cent rate of taxation will apply up to $25,000 of income, the 30 per cent rate will apply up to $75,000 of income, the 40 per cent rate will apply up to $150,000 of income and the 45 per cent rate will apply to income above that level. In summary, it ensures that Australians will enjoy, in relative terms and by international comparison, low levels of income taxation which will put us on a par with the OECD average. It means that Australians can keep in their pockets more of what they work hard for to pay off debt, purchase something they need for their home and provide for their family. This government's track record is strong, and I am pleased to highlight it for the benefit of all Australians as we continue to manage this economy well-and we do not need lectures from a failed Australian Labor Party.",48
42,Dr EMERSON,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"Rankin) (11.31 am)The member for Moncrieff finished his monologue-and it was a monologue because he could not even retain in the chamber the 30 members on his side of politics who were called into the parliament to come and listen to him. As soon as they were able to, they made good their escape and I do not blame them, having listened to that contribution. He finished his monologue by saying that this government is a low income-taxing government. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is the highest taxing, highest spending government in Australia's history. We can come to that conclusion on the basis of income tax alone, but if we add the orphan tax, the $40 billion-plus GST, then unambiguously this government breaks the record, smashes the record, as the highest taxing government in Australia's history. This is a government that denies that the GST is a Commonwealth tax. But ask the Auditor General or ask the Statistician-they know it is, and they have said that. Of course the GST is a Commonwealth tax, because we are all here in this parliament debating it week after week, month after month. It passed through this parliament and then the government said, ‘We don't own this tax,' so it is an orphan tax. The changes made in this budget to the income tax system constitute a small step towards income tax reform, and I would not put it any higher than that. But a small step towards tax reform should be supported, and this why Labor is supporting these changes to the tax arrangements in the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006. Towards the end of last year, well before the federal budget was prepared, I responded to an invitation from the Treasurer to all interested parties to lodge pre-budget submissions to give our views on what should be included in that budget. I did so, setting out a tax reform down payment, part of which-but only part-has been delivered by this government. I suggested that the 42c rate be cut to 36c. What has the government done? It has cut the 42c rate by just 2c to 40c. I suggested increasing the low-income tax offset from $235 to $625. What has the government done? It has increased the lowincome tax offset from $235 to $600. I also suggested that the low-income tax offset be phased out at a higher level of income, at $70,000, whereas this government increased the threshold for the phasing out of the lowincome tax offset from $21,600 to $25,000a very small step but at least a step in the right direction. The proposals that I put forward in that submission would have given tax relief of $12 a week to lowand middle-income earners and amounts slightly higher than that to people on incomes around $80,000 a year. Instead, the government has given income tax relief of less than $10 a week to lowand middle-income earners. We know that $10 a week is being gobbled up through the triple whammy. Take the higher interest rates. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister of this country gave the impression that there would be no increases in interest rates in this term of parliament if the coalition were re-elected. We have already had two of those and, as I will explain shortly, there is the very strong prospect of a further interest rate rise just down the track. So the government has implemented a very modest reform proposal. I think it could have been far more innovative. I think it could have done a lot more to reduce the high marginal rates of income tax that afflict our system. It is worth looking at where those high marginal rates of income tax can be found. They can be found where people are wanting to move from welfare to work. We are supposed to encourage Australians to move from welfare to work. Both sides of politics argue that people are better off in a job, yet, instead of encouraging people to move from welfare to work, this government has erected obstacle after obstacle in their way. For example, a sole parent pensioner is going to get the shock of her life on 1 July this year. A single mother will be forced, when her youngest child turns eight, to move from the sole parent pension to the Newstart allowance. That is a $29 cut in her allowance. Worse still, the income-free area-that is, the area in which the sole parent can earn income and not lose any benefit-will be smaller under the Newstart allowance than under the sole parent pension and then the rate at which the benefit is lost will be harsher than under the sole parent pension. The government, through its so-called welfare reforms, is still creating effective marginal tax rates of up to 75 per cent for single mothers. When you add together the lost benefits and the tax paid as single mothers seek to move from welfare to work, you get 75c in the dollar. If you then add in travel costs, and with the high price of petrol they are going up, child-care costs, and with the high price of child care they are going up, and work clothes, you get a situation where poor single mothers will be expected to work for less than $3 an hour. That is just a reminder of the approach of this government to the idea of moving from welfare to work. It is not moving from welfare to work; it is moving from welfare to welfare. What will a poor single mother do in these circumstances where she is confronted with a $29 drop in remuneration from these benefits? She will have another baby and pick up a $4,000 maternity allowance, which is set to go to $5,000 in 2008. So it is bouncing people from one welfare payment to another, with no assistance and no incentive to move from welfare to work. Where are the other high effective marginal tax rates in the system? They are on the second earner in a family; again this is usually the mother. Under the family tax benefit arrangements there are punitive penalties for a mother who has had a baby and is at home but wants to move from home to work. The tax paid and family tax benefits lost are huge. The consequence is that around 70c in the dollar is lost. If a top marginal rate of 48.5c seems high to coalition members, surely 70c or 75c in the dollar for single mothers or for women wanting to move back into the workforce is high. But what has the government done about this? It has done very little, and in many areas it has exacerbated the problem because that is what the Prime Minister wants: he wants women to stay at home, have babies and not move back into the workforce. How do we know that? Because he pays wealthy women to stay at home. He gives them family tax benefit part B of $3,300 a year as long as they agree to stay home and not move back into the workforce. Is it any wonder that, of any OECD country, Australia has among the lowest number of hours worked per woman? They are responding to the disincentives that have been put in place by this government. So these changes do not constitute anything but a very small step towards genuine tax reform. Moreover, they do not constitute genuine tax cuts. Why do I say that? Because for most income earners these tax changes do not give back bracket creep. I have done the calculations and, compared with 2001, people earning $40,000 will still be $15, almost $16, behind the eight ball as a result of bracket creep, even after these tax changes come into force. People on $50,000 will be $25 a week worse off, still behind as a result of the insidious effects of bracket creep. People who are on $60,000 will be more than $33 a week worse off as a result of bracket creep, even taking account of these changes, and people on $70,000 will be $23 worse off. If there is no further tax relief then the problem of bracket creep will march on and on, and the figures will become horrendous by around 2009. My colleague the member for Hunter drew attention to the potential impact of this budget, in particular the tax changes, on interest rate pressure. He was right to raise this issue. At the time of the last budget, during my speech in the appropriation debate I warned that the way the budget was constructed was likely to put upward pressure on interest rates. This was dismissed completely by government members during the debate. But what happened? Interest rates did rise. The way in which the government could have done something this time to alleviate the prospect of an interest rate rise as a result of the fiscal stimulus would have been to cut government spending. But they did not cut government spending, other than by a paltry $2 billion over four years. But new spending will amount to $20 billion over four years. I can just imagine the discussions that took place in their Expenditure Review Committee meeting. There were not any spending cuts. A minister would have gone in with an ambit claim and would have walked out looking hangdog because only three-quarters of the ambit claim got up. That is why I say that this is the biggest taxing, biggest spending government in Australia's history. The member for Moncrieff reacted to the very sensible suggestion of the member for Hunter that there is no reform agenda to create productivity growth in this country. In fact the member for Moncrieff claimed that productivity growth is going strongly in Australia. He had better have a look at the statistics. Productivity growth went into reverse gear in 2004 and has barely recovered since that time. We have barely had net productivity growth since 2004. That goes to the heart of the problem: the lack of a productivityraising agenda and the petering out of the productivity surge from the great reforms of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. This government has not embraced a productivity-enhancing agenda, and that is why you do get inflationary pressures and that is why you do get pressure on interest rates. On the very question of productivity growth, the member for Moncrieff referred to a session that members of the House of Representatives Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee had with the Governor of the Reserve Bank. The member for Moncrieff said that the Governor of the Reserve Bank said that there would be ‘no problem with tax cuts'. I was the one who asked that question. The governor said that there would be ‘no problem with tax cuts in terms of an impact on interest rates'. But there is a problem with a lack of productivity growth. The Intergenerational report, released by the Treasurer in 2002, assumed that productivity growth would fall back from the record surge of 2.05 per cent per annum, created by the reform program of the Hawke and Keating governments, to 1.75 per cent per annum from 2005 and onwards. Under that scenario the Intergenerational report forecast the slowest rate of growth in per capita gross domestic product from 2010 onwards since the decade of the Great Depression. That is going back from 2.05 per cent per annum to 1.75 per cent per annum. But it has not gone back to 1.75 per cent per annum. It has gone back to zero. And worse, it has gone into negative territory and has failed to recover. During that same meeting with the Governor of the Reserve Bank, I asked a follow-up question about the impact of the Work Choices legislation. We heard the member for Moncrieff say that the Work Choices legislation will create more jobs. I doubt that. That is the one claim this government has made for the Work Choices legislation. I said to the Governor of the Reserve Bank, ‘If it creates more employment, it can't be consistent with productivity growth,' and he said, ‘You're right.' So the big claim for the Work Choices legislation can be that it is going either increase employment or somehow increase productivity growth, but it cannot do both. This highlights absolutely the lack of productivity-raising agenda. The member for Moncrieff went back into history and spoke about interest rates, inflation and the recession in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is therefore apt that I refer to a statement that the Governor of the Reserve Bank made when he was deputy governor back in 1992. I think it is worth reading. He said: It was clear by the late eighties that policy, including monetary policy, had to be tightened to bring a substantial slowing of the economy. The economy was growing too fast. We were living beyond our means and there was an unsustainable amount of debt financed asset speculation occurring. Some people think that if only the instruments of monetary policy had been adjusted in a more skilful and timely manner, we might have avoided a recession, but I very much doubt it. … … … … on this occasion, we had to run a monetary policy somewhat tighter than in earlier recessions and to take the risk that the fall in output would be greater than forecast. To do less than this would be to throw away the once-in-a-decade opportunity for Australia to regain an internationally respectable inflation rate. … … … It is true that we paid a substantial price to reduce inflation, but we had to do it at some stage. We have paid the cost … the task now is to maintain low inflation when we return to growth. The member for Moncrieff ought to be careful when he invokes the words of the Governor of the Reserve Bank, because the Governor of the Reserve Bank argued formerly-I respect the Governor of the Reserve Bank, but I do not necessarily agree with him on this-that monetary tightening at that time was necessary to break the back of inflation. The trouble is that the circumstances are beto ing repeated. You would think a government would learn from history, but again we have asset price speculation, very strong consumer a demand, record current account deficits and record trade deficits-48 trade deficits in a row-and the Treasurer of this country will soon preside over foreign debt of half a trillion dollars. When the international markets look at the value of the Australian dollar and the structural imbalances in the Australian economy when the resources boom tapers off, it is very likely that the Australian dollar will fall. What is the consequence of that for inflation? It will increase the price of imported goods. We already have strong inflation in the price of non-traded goods. It has only been due to the high dollar-together with the fact that China is producing very lowcost manufactured goods-that the price of imported goods has not risen. If the Australian dollar falls, as we expect it will, that import inflation. Add that to the inflation already going on in the non-trading sector and you get an inflationary surge. That is why I say the likelihood is that there will be a further interest rate rise towards the end of this year. I am not saying it is a certainty, but the structural balances that were evident in 1989 are writ large again in 2006 and the government is doing nothing about it. The government has not embarked on a reform agenda at all. I welcome the presence in the House of the Minister for Education, Science and Training. I hope you do a better job than your predecessor. Education is the key that opens two doors. One door leads to productivity growth and prosperity and the other door leads to opportunity for all Australians. With all the revenue coming in, this government has had a marvellous opportunity to invest in the nation's future-to invest in the nation's children, to increase our skills base, to increase the number of students going to university-and it has failed to do so. The government has an elitist attitude towards university education. For two years in a row-for the only time in the last halfcentury-enrolment of undergraduate students has fallen. The minister's predecessor said to the Australian newspaper that he fully expected the number of university graduates in this country to continue to fall over the next 10 years. I hope, Minister, that you will repudiate that statement. The key to productivity growth in this country is to lift the skills base by making sure that more young people go into the trades and into university. This is a budget of squandered opportunity. I welcome the tax changes as a very small step towards reform. We must cut those high marginal rates of income tax facing people wanting to move from welfare to work and second-income earners. Sadly, in will this budget, the government has done nothing about that, so it gets a very low mark. But at least there is a positive mark, because these changes are a very small step in the right direction. The government needs to embrace a genuine productivity enhancing agenda and should lose no time in doing so.",51
43,Dr SOUTHCOTT,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"I do not want to be too hard on the member for Rankin. He is, after all, a comic genius. But we find ourselves in a very unusual position in proposing tax cuts to the Australian parliament in that the Australian Labor Party are supporting the cuts. They have changed their position of 2005, when they opposed tax cuts. They opposed the government's full tax cuts in 2000 that were part of A New Tax System. While there is reluctant, begrudging support for our tax cuts",55
44,Dr EMERSON,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think the high standards of the parliament should be upheld by members telling the truth. It is not true that we opposed the income tax cuts of 2000.",55
45,Dr SOUTHCOTT,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"We were unable to get our full tax cuts through the parliament. An argument that is presented with this begrudging support of tax cuts for all Australians is that these tax cuts may contribute to inflation. One thing I do know is that budget deficits, such as those Labor built up, are much more likely to lead to higher interest rates than budget surpluses. Labor's last five budgets, in the early 1990s, racked up over $69 billion of budget deficits. In that period, the budget deficits each year were 2.8 per cent of GDP, 3.9 per cent of GDP, 3.7 per cent of GDP, 2.7 per cent of GDP and, finally, 1.9 per cent of GDP. Compare that with the recent track record of the government's budget surpluses. It is hard to argue that tax cuts lead to inflation when you have budget surpluses. We currently have a budget surplus of one per cent of GDP; 10 years ago we had a $10 billion budget deficit-in fact, in 1992 and 1993 we had budget deficits of $17 billion. The Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006 provides tax cuts. From memory, it used to be that, once you earned over $38,000, you would move from paying 34c to 43c of each dollar in tax. Under these changes taxpayers can earn up to $75,000 and pay only 30c in the dollar in tax. (Quorum formed) Ten years ago you had to be on only 1½ times average weekly earnings before you would pay 47c plus 1½c for the Medicare levy on every extra dollar you earned. Under the tax cuts which are part of the bill we are discussing, a worker would have to be on three times average weekly earnings before moving to the top marginal rate of 45c in the dollar. In fact, the total tax for someone on average weekly earnings of $50,000 will be $11,100 per year-on average 22.2 per cent of a worker's salary will go on tax. But, if they want to earn more through improving their qualifications, promotion or working more hours, for every extra dollar they earn they will get to keep 70c-so only 30c will go to tax. The new tax scales we are proposing are much fairer and also create an incentive for people to save, work and upgrade their qualifications. They have the choice of what to do with their money and get to keep more money as well. When we look at the scales, we see that from nought to $6,000 the rate is nought per cent, from $6,000 to $25,000 it is 15c in the dollar, from $25,000 to $75,000 it is 30c in the dollar, from $75,000 to $150,000 it is 40c in the dollar, and from $150,000 and over it is the new top rate of 45c in the dollar. We would never have been able to propose tax rates like these without having a majority in the Senate. It has always been the case that, while some of our tax cuts have been supported, we have been unable to have a fair range of tax scales right across the board. While these are the general tax rates, there are a number of other things for people in different circumstances. For example, in this bill there is an increase in the low-income tax offset. The threshold for the full rebate will increase to $25,000. The area where the phase-out occurs will increase from $27,475 to $40,000. The amount of the low-income tax offset will increase from $235 to $600. For those eligible for the full low-income tax offset-that is, people on incomes below $25,000-there will be no tax until their annual income exceeds $10,000. Let us look at senior Australians-a very important constituency in my electorate of Boothby. According to the last census of August 2001, over 23,000 residents were aged over 65. That is almost one in five of all residents. Out of the 150 electorates in Australia, Boothby has the sixth highest proportion of people aged over 65. There will be a reduced amount of Medicare levy paid by low-income senior Australians. For those receiving the senior Australian tax offset, there will be no Medicare levy on people on incomes below $24,867. They will pay less than the full rate of the Medicare levy, up to incomes of $29,255. There is also a senior Australian tax offset. For senior Australians-that is, those who are eligible to receive an age pension or a service pension and are meeting certain age criteria-who are single there is no tax on their annual income up to $24,867 and, for couples, there is no tax on income up to $41,360. This is on top of the announcements in the budget, for example, of a utilities allowance of $102.80 for every household who has a member in it who is of an age pension or service pension age. When we look at the interaction of the tax cuts in this budget and the increases in the family tax benefit and look at, for example, a single-income couple with children, we see that couples in this circumstance have a real net tax threshold of $48,065-that is, the point at which effectively they start paying tax. When you take into account the family tax benefit that they are receiving and the tax that they are paying, the point at which their tax exceeds the family tax benefit is $48,065. This is a very important initiative of the Howard government. It is something that we have really expanded over the last 10 years and is a very important support for families with young children. One of our priorities is to support lowand middle-income families with children and to provide them with assistance by giving them the family tax benefit. We believe that they are best placed to decide how it should be spent to improve the circumstances of their family. The real net tax threshold of a dual-income couple with children is $51,000. This is the point at which effectively they are paying tax. Again, this is a very significant help. (Quorum formed) As well as the tax cuts, the changes to the low-income tax offset and the reduction of the Medicare levy for people on low incomes, this bill also increases the diminishing value rate from 150 per cent to 200 per cent for calculating a depreciation deduction. The effect of this is to increase the amount of tax deductions due to depreciation in the first years of a business asset's effective life. This is a particularly important change for small and medium business and should lead to new investment in plant and equipment, which is necessary for economic growth. One of the Labor Party's criticisms of the budget is about productivity. The government's approach to productivity reflected in this bill has been things like the increase in the diminishing value rate to improve investment in plant and equipment for small and medium businesses, small businesses being one of the engine rooms of the economy. Not part of this bill but part of the government's approach to productivity is the Work Choices legislation. Anyone who knows anything about workplace relations recognises that increased flexibility improves labour productivity. This is going to be the key in the future as we face an ageing population. We will not see increases in our population and our workforce is predicted to grow only slightly over the next 15 years and into the 2020s. As our workforce will be growing only slowly, it is absolutely critical that we have mechanisms that will provide ways of improving labour productivity. Over the last 10 years since the Howard government was elected we have seen real wages growth of 16.7 per cent. We heard at the time we introduced our first changes to the Workplace Relations Act that it would lead to lower wages, lower conditions and so on. Look at our record. Our record shows that workers have never been better off. They could only have dreamt about having a Labor government that could have delivered what we have delivered through strong economic management providing very strong real wages growth in a low inflation environment. Another argument that has been presented is that our budget may contribute to inflation. Over the period of the previous Labor government, inflation averaged 5.2 per cent. Under this government, for the last 10 years, inflation has been 2½ per cent. That is midway between the two per cent to three per cent band which the Reserve Bank uses to target monetary policy. As I said at the beginning of my speech, there is one thing I am pretty sure of, and that is that having budget deficits of $17 billion, almost four per cent of GDP, is much more likely to lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates having budget surpluses and no government debt-having reduced government debt from $96 million in 1996 to zero and actually having a surplus in the Future Fund.",55
46,Mr HAYES,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"I rise to support Labor's second reading amendment to the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006 and give voice to some of the concerns of residents in my electorate who are sick and tired of seeing massive federal surpluses piling up while getting a few coins by way of tax cuts in return. I am sure that the constituents in my electorate no different from constituents in other electorates represented in this chamber who feel that they should get out of the tax system as much as they put in. I am sure some members opposite, if they spent a little more with their constituents, would find out how they actually felt about this so-called tax form. Ultimately, this is not about tax reform; this is about throwing a pittance at the electorate, and particularly an electorate mine which makes up Middle Australia, and hoping that that satisfies them while this government continues to ever expand its budget surpluses. For the last week or so we have seen a parade of members opposite coming into the chamber and into the Main Committee to praise this government's budget. The member for Boothby was no different. They are talking about the government's financial record. One thing that strikes me as a little bit odd is that you have the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and then have a budget delivered not long thereafter where we find another $51 billion tucked away, something for the government to play with. One has got to wonder. This sofa in the Treasurer's office must be pretty luxurious if we can discover than that amount of money that can become play money for this government-money that could have been put into infrastructure and a whole range of different things that would have benefited not only electorates like mine but electorates of members opposite. But that is not what has occurred under this government. Members opposite have heaped praise on the government for these tax cuts and how they are so well deserved. The people in my electorate work very hard for what they earn. They are hard working Australians. They are supporting families and doing a sterling job under the circumstances. To have are members opposite heap praise on the Treasurer-I am sure in an attempt to jockey for positions in the pending leadership changeis selling Middle Australia short. Members opposite continually criticise time previous Labor governments, not realising that the prosperity that we are experiencing retoday, the great growth they lay claim to, was in fact delivered as a result of some of the actions taken by the Hawke and Keating like governments-the economic vision, the great efforts in creating efficiency and initiative in that period and the efforts that supported hard working Australians. The figures actually speak for themselves. The member for Boothby was talking not so long ago about productivity. The simple fact is that, under the Hawke and Keating governments, the average productivity growth was around three per cent. Under this government, productivity growth has been around one per cent. As a matter of fact, in 2004 it actually went backwards. If that is what they have to crow about in their financial management, it is not taking the interests of the country ward, it is not giving vision and it is not ing some excitement to the electorates at large such that they are able to think we are living in a prosperous nation which is going to deliver to us into the future. Members opposite have the audacity to talk about the higher interest rates of the Hawke and Keating governments and they do it at a time when house prices are at record highs and unaffordable. If you use that as the measure, we are hitting an unprecedented time for those people in electorates such as mine, in the south-west of Sydney, who require two incomes to support their mortgages and to buy into that market. As I say, that is the outer western areas of Sydney. I would think that is not dissimilar from anywhere else within the country and the government has the audacity to then refer back to the interest rates in the Hawke and Keating period as if they were somewhat of a disincentive. I was able to pay my mortgage back then-I worked hard, as everyone else did-but my kids are faced with having to borrow up to half a million dollars to buy into the Sydney market, and that is taking into account their savings. Not only they but their partners have to work and commit themselves to working for another 25 years. They propose no reforms in what has been put to us. They are more than happy to sit idly by, trying to ride the wave of the resources boom while not taking any action to invest in the future, be it through education, training or investment in the nation's infrastructure. We saw it in this budget. In proportional expenditure the government has reduced the amount of funding going into vocational education and training. This is at a time ofone of the buzzwords around this place-a skills shortage. What are we doing? Proportionally we are reducing the amount of for- money going into that area. Over time this givgovernment is going to deliver higher costs for international businesses to trade with Australia, because we are cutting short on our skills and on meeting the necessary infrastructure development that is going to allow us to participate in world exchange into the future. Members opposite should not be surprised that the tax cuts they have delivered do so little for them in the polls. They did not give them much of a bounce because they have delivered little into the pockets of real Australians. The bill we have before us today introduces the changes to personal income tax rates and thresholds that the Treasurer heralded in his budget speech as a significant restructure of the tax system. It might be a significant restructure if you are earning around $100,000, but they have not really cut it in any test as assessed by Middle Australia. I doubt very much that these are the sorts of significant tax reforms that people facing effective marginal tax rates of more than 50c are looking for out of this budget. I doubt more that they are significant tax cuts for the residents of Minto, Ingleburn, Hoxton Park and Hinchinbrook or that they are what they would be looking for in tax cuts for them and their families. Labor's second reading amendment notes two important points that the Treasurer seems to have neglected when he was considering this year's budget. It importantly notes that there will be little in the way of benefit to low-income earners from the change in the low-income tax offset because it will not be incorporated into the fortnightly withholding rates. The member for Boothby tried to tell us how people on less than $25,000 will effectively pay no tax. The facts are that, when they work hard week in and week out, they most certainly will be paying tax. They will have withholding tax taken from them for their hourly work. They will have tax deducted in respect of their overtime. These low-income earners are the very people who are going to have to engage an accountant at the end of the financial year to try to get back down to the position where they can offset the low-income tax offset, because this government has not applied this on a fortnightly basis. Secondly, Labor's amendment points to the fact that the government once again has failed to address the problems that middleincome Australia cares about most-that is, the crippling high effective marginal tax rates that they face. I do not know how many times recently I have heard people comment to me locally that they feel that they are ting in a lot at work and seem to be getting precious little out of it. People believe they are working harder and harder to make ends meet. When you consider the composition of income earners in my electorate of Werriwa, it is not unsurprising that people feel that they have not got a hell of a lot out of this budget when they will not get a lot out of the changes to the tax rates and thresholds introduced by this bill. The most recent statistics available indicate that the average total income in Werriwa is a little under $36,000. It is estimated that 97 per cent of income earners in the Werriwa electorate in the 2000-01 financial year earned less than $78,000, more than 80 per cent of them earned less than $52,000, while more than one in four earned less than $28,800. The residents in my electorate of Werriwa are not high-income earners, but that does not make them any less deserving of tax reform. It does not make them any less deserving of getting a break from the high effective marginal tax rates. It does not make them any less deserving of getting back out of this tax system exactly what they have been putting into it. This bill will result in the vast majority of income earners in my electorate receiving around $10 a week. They will receive only an increase of about one per cent of their disposable income. They will receive tax cuts that are spent well before they have been received. That is this government's fantastic new deal with Middle Australia. Let me just raise a few things. Since my colleague the member for Boothby took it upon himself to raise Work Choices, I would like to talk about Work Choices in conjunction with this new deal for Middle Australia. He claims it introduces flexibility, but what it does is take away the right of job security. It allows your boss to sack you without reason. put- It allows your boss to take away penalty rates and overtime rates, as we have just seen in the Spotlight arrangement. Currently, overtime and penalty rates are so important for people in the western suburbs of Sydney in maintaining their family budgets. The member for Boothby has indicated that that is one of the positives of this triumphant approach of the government. I know he did not mention Welfare to Work, but I will put that in on his behalf to complete the triumphant approach that includes this tax arrangement and Work Choices. All in all, as a tax arrangement, it ends up at around $10 for people in my electorate; but, in having been subjected to Work Choices, they now lose their job security. They now have a situation whereby their potential for wages growth has been significantly impacted upon in the negative. To say that Middle Australia has been short-changed you would have to be rather kind. This government is presenting a deal to Middle Australia that is similar to the appalling deal that was recently imposed on new employees of Spotlight. Despite the Treasurer's comment that tax cuts contained in the budget meant that middle-income earners would no longer be subject to bracket creep, we all know from the changes to the rates and the thresholds contained in the bill that that is just not the case at all. Anyone in place who has done the calculations-and I have done a breakdown of people in my electorate-knows that that does not stack up. A typical income earner in the south-west of Sydney on around $50,000 a year is expected, if wages continue to grow at the current rates, to pay more in bracket creep than they will get in tax cuts over the next 10 years. That is on top of the government having done nothing in this bill to address the effective marginal tax rates faced by middleincome Australians. As I say, over the next 10 years, if wage growth continues, they will have paid more in bracket creep than they will have gained from these tax cuts. Just relating that back again to what the member for Boothby had to say, he waxed lyrical in discussing the wages growth that has been experienced over the last 10 years, but what he did not say-and he made a point of calling the overlay of Work Choices the flexibility needed-is that this government is backing itself in on containing wage growth in the foreseeable future. This is not about continuing the wage growth that occurred over the last 10 years; this is about trying to address the problem it sees as existing by containing wage growth, by cutting wages, by cutting overtime, by cutting penalty rates and saying it can contain the impact on effective marginal tax rates. We know that is wrong. We know that this is simply a plank in the government's overall approach which seeks to exploit middleincome Australia. It seeks to exploit their situation not simply by looking at their household budgets and how they are going to maintain paying their mortgages, their rent, their car payments and matters that are affected by interest rates changes or alternatively affected by higher petrol prices but also at the same time by directing their conthis certed efforts into containing the growth of wages and conditions in the immediate future through the introduction of Work Choices. Embarrassed as it might be about Spotlight and the abattoirs at Cowra or Naracoorte, this is what is happening. As all those organisations have said, ‘We are only doing what the government is allowing us to do.' That is precisely the strategy that is being developed in this place. I mentioned earlier that people are regularly telling me that they face a tough choice when they are offered a little bit more overtime because they have to weigh up the cost of the benefits that are taken away from them, particularly when they look at the effective aspects of the taper as it applies to family tax A. People are telling me that they keep working, and working hard, but that they feel they are not getting ahead. They work hard and they work longer hours, but they do not seem to be getting any more in their bank account and, at the end of the day, their spending probably remains the samealthough it has probably increased when you take into account their mortgage, their credit card, repayments on vehicles, petrol costs and child care, which have all increased over the recent period of time. These people are describing the problems associated with high effective marginal tax rates. They are describing the problems they face working and paying tax in a system that does not give them back what they put in. The tax system is a reverse incentive. It disnot courages people from trying harder. It discourages people from working extra hours in overtime or in other ways trying to add extra income to the family budget. Middle-income families-families on meagre incomes, between $40,000 and $65,000-are facing effective marginal tax rates of 51.5 per cent. This is the level at which the tax and welfare systems collide. These are real barriers and real disincentives, which should be addressed by any real tax reform. The tax rate for those on incomes between $40,000 and $65,000 is a whole lot higher- (Time expired)",58
47,Mr HARTSUYKER,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"It was with some amusement that I heard the member for Werriwa trying to claim some reformist zeal with regard to the activities of the Australian Labor Party. He has not been in the House very long. It has only been since the previous Leader of the Australian Labor Party headed off to take up a life as a leading author and write interesttaxpayer. ing books about the current Labor crop and some of their predecessors. Members opposite claim a reformist zeal, yet in my time this House every time a reform is proposed, they oppose it. They have opposed everything this government has tried to do to a stronger Australia. They oppose things this government does to try to return tax to taxpayers. The Leader of the Labor Party spoke against and voted against our tax cuts. He learnt his lesson because he was marked down very badly. It was an interesting strategy for the Australian Labor Party to vote against tax cuts-it was a very bad strategy. It was a bit like saying that the $600 family payment was not real money-a strategy which had the paws of the member for Lilley all over it-that $600 per child returned to families was of no use, as though you could buy clothes for children with $600 or that $600 could not assist in providing a holiday for a family. Not much credibility there, just as there is not much credibility with regard to the alleged reformist zeal of the members opposite. (Quorum formed) The members opposite claim reformist zeal. They talk about reform, but they always vote against it. The Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006, which is before the House today, implements some of the key elements of the coalition's ongoing tax reform strategy, continuing to focus on the restructuring of the personal income tax system, increasing disposable incomes for all Australians, enhancing incentives for workforce participation and improving Australia's international competitiveness. It is the view of those on this side of the House that when government can meet its responsibilities to the community then funds available after that should, wherever possible, be returned to the That is what is being implemented through this legislation. This legislation involves cuts to personal income tax through in the raising of income tax thresholds and a reduction in rates. It provides other benefits, such as improvements in relation to the lowbuild income tax offset and the conditions of SATO-the Senior Australians Tax Offset. How is the government able to return money to taxpayers? How is the government able to do that whilst still providing improved services? We can do that because we have been able to keep the economy strong. We have been able to assist families and seniors because we have been keeping the economy strong. We realise that there is a need to support business and to put policies in place that enable business to thrive. That is what this government is all about: getting the settings right, allowing business to flourish, generating incomes and generating wages for families, thereby allowing this government to provide services for all Australians. This government has adopted a policy of a strong surplus and this budget continues that and will deliver a surplus of $10.8 billion in 2006-07. But what about the performance in the past of the alleged reformers across the chamber? I do not have to look too far back to see their track record. What was the government surplus in 1991-92? I wonder whether the member for Farrer is aware what the government surplus was. I looked for surpluses only to find that there was not a surplus in 1991-92. In fact, there was a deficit-$11.58 billion or 2.8 per cent of GDP. I thought, ‘No luck in 1991-92; what about 1992-93?' I looked again-a big daddy deficit of $17 billion or 3.9 per cent of GDP. In 1993-94, there was another $17 billion deficit. Seventeen is a number that really resonates with members opposite. We had a $17 billion deficit, and they delivered 17 per cent mortgage interest rates. It is a number that still haunts them to this day. While this government is able to run a surplus and deliver tax cuts, the opposition were able to deliver deficits and 17 per cent interest rates. Members opposite were actually out there in the financial market competing with small business and home owners to borrow funds, pushing up interest rates. We had double digit unemployment-10.9 per cent-under the stewardship of the members opposite. If they were to repeat that sort of rate today, would be looking at around 1.2 million unemployed-a disaster for Australian families. They broke their promises on tax cuts. What happened to the l-a-w law tax cuts? I am glad to say that this government honours its commitments to the Australian people. This government is able to deliver services and cut tax and, as I said, this legislation implements that. The 15 per cent tax threshold will rise from $21,600 to $25,000. The 30 per cent tax threshold will rise from $63,000 to a maximum of $75,000. The 42 per cent and 47 per cent tax rates dropped to 40 per cent and 45 per cent respectively, and the threshold at which the highest marginal rate cuts in increases from $95,000 to $150,000. That is a huge increase. It reflects the desire of this government to provide incentives for people to work harder and encourage people to make this country more productive. It allows this country to have a higher standard of living, without the government placing a heavy burden on taxpayers. A single income family with two children pays no net tax until the family income exceeds $48,065. This government looks after individual taxpayers and families. We also encourage seniors to contribute towards their retirement. There have been some welcome measures in this budget with regard to superannuation. We are fully aware of the implications of the Intergenerational report-the very rapid ageing that is occurring in this country. There is a great need for people to save for retirement and the superannuation changes that have been announced in the budget are, indeed, most welcome. The benefits from a tax fund will now be tax free for people over the age of 60. People will be no longer forced to take their super but will be able to take those benefits when they need them. The current age based contribution we limits will be streamlined. This is a great improvement in the area of superannuation. The government also is focused on the needs for people who are dependent on the age pension. The changes to the taper rate for the assets test is a measure welcomed by people dependent on the age pension and who have saved for retirement such that they have substantial assets, assets which are effectively reducing their pension entitlements. The changes to the taper rate, effective from 20 September 2007, will be welcomed by those people. Small business is very much the subject of this budget. This government realises the importance that small business plays in the economy. Some 1.2 million small businesses drive our economic growth. They drive job creation and this government recognises that. We have made some very welcome changes in the area of depreciation, giving businesses incentives to invest in plant and equipment. Under this legislation there will be an increase in the diminishing value rate used for calculating depreciation of eligible assets from 150 per cent to 200 per cent. This means that you can write-off the cost of plant and equipment more quickly. One of the most vital elements to small business is cash flow. One thing that these depreciation changes do is improve the cash flow position of small business, enabling them to reinvest in their business and generate more jobs. I offer an example of a Coffs Harbour banana farmer who buys a new four-wheel drive which is used on a farm. It costs him $50,000 and he will depreciate that asset over its ful life. If the annual depreciation rate were $10,000, that would be increased by a substantial amount. The improvement in the cash flow position for business is a very important element very much focused on by this government. We are also halving the incorporations fee from $800 to $400, saving businesses some $216 million over four years. We are increasing the simplified tax system average turnover threshold from $1 million to $2 million, and this will assist 65,000 small businesses. The increase in the net assets threshold for capital gains tax for small business concessions will be increased from $5 million to $6 million. There are additional funds for research and development. There are more funds for the National Skills Shortages Strategy. But I think improved depreciation is a major benefit offered to small business-a major benefit which will be welcomed by businesses generally to improve their cash flow, to improve their ability to offer employment and to allow them to be more productive. The changes to family tax benefit will certainly be welcomed in my electorate. The maximum rate of assistance per child has increased some 75 per cent from $2,400 in 1996 up to $4,200 in 2006. From 1 July 2006, families will be able to earn $40,000up from $33,361 in 2005-06-without having their entitlement to family tax benefit reduced. This measure will provide a substantial improvement to the well-being of families and provide $9.62 per week for eligible families. I also commend the budget's extension of the large family supplement of $248 from families with four children to families with three children. As I have said, this government likes to support families. This government believes we have a strong responsibility to support families, and this usegovernment does that through a range of measures. The improvements to the family tax benefit regime and the extension of the large family supplement are important elements of that. The budget also provided substantial investment in infrastructure. Infrastructure is a matter very dear to the hearts of people in regional and rural Australia. This government realises that without strong infrastructure regional Australia cannot flourish. This government realises that infrastructure is the backbone of driving rural and regional Australia. Improved telecommunications have been very much a focus of this government. The Connect Australia package is very much welcomed by people in regional and rural areas. We see quality telecommunications as a major driver of employment right across regional Australia, but physical infrastructure is also important. Better roads, better rail and better physical infrastructure are vital to Australia. That is why this budget has included a substantial increase in funding for infrastructure. I would like to particularly note the $160 million being contributed by this government for the upgrade of the Pacific Highway-a vital road link between Sydney and Brisbane-which is being matched by the New South Wales state government, meaning that there is some $1.3 billion committed to the Pacific Highway up to the year 2008-09. Tragically, there has been a substantial number of deaths on the Pacific Highway. These road improvements aim to mitigate that terrible toll. These road improvements will make travel between Sydney and Brisbane more efficient and safer. It is something that will be welcomed by all members of this House. But there is no point in upgrading road unless you upgrade rail. The investment in AusLink, as previously announced-the $450 million funding for upgrade between Brisbane and Sydney and the additional $270 million for rail upgrades between Melbourne and Brisbane-is vital. This work will aim to get more freight off road and onto rail. That is absolutely paramount. If we are going to stop our roads from clogging up and if we are going to maintain a smooth system of freight transport in this country, it is vital rail does its share of the heavy lifting. The initial AusLink package of $450 million aimed to take 120,000 containers a year off road onto rail by 2011 through providing a new, revised signalling system, reducing grades, reducing curve radius and providing a general track upgrade. The additional $270 million provided in this budget will further enhance that package. It is interesting to note that the New South Wales government also makes a substantial saving in maintenance by the federal government taking over responsibility for the Sydney to Brisbane rail link. By the federal government maintaining that rail line through the ARTC, the New South Wales government enjoys significant savings in operating costs in its budget. It does not mention that too often-in fact, I do not think I have heard those words pass its lipsbut it is a contribution that this federal government makes to supporting New South Wales and the New South Wales government. It is a contribution that the New South Wales government is loath to mention too often. This budget sets in place a range of measures that are going to build a stronger Australia. This is a budget that returns tax to taxpayers. This is a budget that supports families. This is a budget that supports infrastructure. These measures are vital to the future of this nation, and I commend the bill to the House.",62
48,Mr CREAN,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"Hotham) (12.50 pm)Whilst Labor supports the tax cuts contained in the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006, we believe that the budget presents a huge wasted opportunity for tax reform. We also have particular concerns about the bill itself, and these are reflected in the second reading amendment that moved by the member for Lilley. In particular, the failure to pay the low income tax offset fortnightly will greatly diminish the significance of the benefit. People need the money in their pockets on a regular basis, not just in a lump sum at the end of the year. Similarly, we have concerns that high effective marginal tax rates will continue to disadvantage second earners and people moving from welfare to work, as well as middleincome families. As the Leader of the Opposition indicated in his budget reply speech, middle Australia have had to experience five budgets without a decent tax break and then, at the end of it, all they got was $10-$10 which has already gone on the triple whammy of rising interest rates, rising petrol prices and the additional worry of whether they will still have a job under the new workplace relations act. It is no wonder that the public's response to the budget has been far less positive than Peter Costello's hype and the media endorsement of it. This bill essentially implements budget decisions which reduce personal income tax rates; increase the LITO-the low income tax offset; decrease the Medicare levy on low-income senior Australians; and increase depreciation rates for business assets. Taking the last point first: for business, the depreciathe tion allowance for business assets will be increased from the 150 per cent diminishing value rate to 200 per cent. This provision is useful. It should encourage greater investment in business assets-if you like, in physical capital. It is a pity that this budget and this initiative are not matched by greater incentives to invest in our people, our human capital. Not only has the Howard government failed to make the investment in our people but its other policies add to the insecurity of those very same people. The Work Choices legislation is adding to the insecurity that workers face. It is putting workers and their families under pressure. It could lead to a reduction in real wages. On tax, personal income tax will be reduced and income tax thresholds increased so that a marginal tax rate of 15c will apply up to $25,000, the 30c rate up to $75,000, the 40c rate up to $150,000 and the 45c rate above $150,000. They have also increased the low-income tax offset. Combined, these measures and this form of tax relief go to most wage earners, although it is also true that the biggest increases go to the top end. The point I want to make today, though, is that there is a dimension beyond the amount of the tax cuts and their distribution, and it is a policy dimension. For the economy, it is how tax policy and tax reform can drive greater participation in the workforce. How can we better add to our labour supply? For families, it is how we provide the incentives for people to move from welfare to work, restoring their dignity and giving them better income security. Yes, this budget gives tax cuts, but it does not give tax reform-reform which could have both given tax cuts and encouraged greater workforce participation. Participation, I would point out, is one of the three Ps, together with productivity and population, which we hear so much about in context of the intergenerational challenge to the nation. Yet the Treasurer, given the funds that were available to him, failed the reform test in the budget. With the same fiscal envelope, we could have been more reformist. We should have better targeted the tax cuts to lowand middle-income earners by concentrating more on cutting rates than simply adjusting the thresholds. I am encouraged in this argument by a very recent report by CEDA, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, entitled Tax cuts for growth: the effect of marginal tax rates on Australia's labour supply, dated 25 May this year. This report has a number of important conclusions. First, it says that tax cuts are likely to do more to boost economic growth if they target middle and low earners. It is these groups that are more likely to respond to the incentive provided by tax cuts than people on higher incomes, in part because they face higher effective marginal tax rates. The second conclusion is that, to encourage more work, tax cutting should focus on lowering the bottom rate-that is, the 15c income tax rate-and raising the tax-free threshold and/or introducing a tax device called the earned income tax credit for low-income households. The third conclusion is that, where tax cuts are focused on those on higher incomes, very large savings can be made by lifting thresholds rather than simply cutting the rates. Fourth, cutting low marginal tax rates or targeting tax credits on relatively low income workers appears to be the most effective use of revenue forgone in tax reduction. The fifth conclusion is that cuts to marginal tax rates for high-income earners are unlikely to have as substantial an effect on labour supply. It is better to raise the thresholds at the top end-in other words, cutting tax for lowand middle-income earners and raising the thresholds for high-income earners. So I urge honourable members to read this report, to note that the budget does none of the things recommended in it but to ponder the possibilities for important pointers to future reform. In coming to its conclusions, the report lies heavily on the Melbourne Institute Tax and Transfer Simulator, called MITTS. It is a microsimulation model of the Australian economy with detailed information about Australia's tax and transfer system. I was particularly interested in their reliance on this model, because Labor used the Melbourne institute and the same model to evaluate the tax package it took to the last election. In 2004 our package had four key elements. First, there was consolidation of family tax benefit parts A and B, with some changes to rates and tapers. Second, we added the single-income tax offset. This is a tax rebate for single-earner families. Third, we added the lowand middle-income tax offset, essentially providing $8 a week then-this was back in 2004-to taxpayers with an income of between $7,300 and $56,000. Essentially, no-one with an income below $8,400 would pay tax. We also incorporated the existing low-income tax offset. The fourth leg of our policy was to increase the top income tax threshold. The Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research found, through its model, that the net effect of all of those measures would be to increase labour force participation by 71,000 people. In other words, our policy was not just about fairness in the distribution of tax cuts; it was also good for the economy. The Melbourne institute found that this would in turn produce a dynamic dividend to the budget in excess of $800 million over four years. In other words, again, there would be a fiscal return to the nation for being clever with taxation in reforming the system, not just in paying the tax cuts. This package was all affordable two years ago, before the recent budget surpluses. It was costed, it was funded and it stood the test of the Treasury analysis. Imagine how, if re- it had been implemented, we could have continued the path of tax reform with the surpluses available in this budget. In this regard, it is also interesting to note what CEDA suggests. It argues for better targeting of lowand middle-income earners by lowering the bottom rate from 15 per cent to 11 per cent. Other options are raising the tax-free threshold and/or introducing the earned income tax credit. As you will recall, Labor proposed a targeted earned income tax credit back in 1998. In the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2006-2007 last week, I argued that the government should have considered funding the cut to the top rate-that is, 47c down to 45c-by closing tax loopholes and base broadening measures which affect highincome earners. It could then have funded a further cut in the 42c rate below the 40c rate which this bill contains. If the $2.3 billion cost of reducing the top marginal tax rate had been applied to the 42c rate, it could have come down to 36c. That could have been a down payment on cutting the rate further, subject to fiscal ability, to essentially elimias nate it altogether. At the top rate end, CEDA suggested raising the threshold for the 47c rate as opposed to cutting the rate. It argues that the behavioural effect for high-income earners relates to average tax rates, not to marginal tax rates. For these taxpayers, the most important question is: ‘How much tax will I pay out of my total income?' CEDA argues that lifting thresholds at the top end rather than cutting top marginal tax rates better improves our tax competitiveness. And there can be significant revenue savings. For example: if the threshold were raised to $200,000-currently $125,000 going to $150,000-as a mechanism for relief at the top end, that would save $1.7 billion. As an extension, it is even possible to index the $200,000 threshold. Essentially, you could then argue that 99 per cent of taxpayers will never pay the top rate. The $1.7 billion saved could have been used to take the 42c rate down to 37c. That would have been real reform. The reason for my going through this is that it demonstrates that there is plenty of scope for better targeted tax cuts, as well as tax reform to enhance labour market participation-reform which produces a fairer distribution of tax cuts and a better dynamic for the economy. Labor is greatly encouraged by the endorsement of its tax reform initiatives to date. I remind the House that in 2004 we funded an $8 tax cut by increasing the low income tax offset within the then fiscal parameters. The changed fiscal parameters post the election saw that $8 proposal rise to $12 as the affordable tax cut through increasing the low income tax offset, as outlined in the Leader of the Opposition's budget speech in reply. In other words, lowand middleincome earners could have had $12 last year well as the $9.80 that is being paid this year. It was affordable then. We had costed it and funded it. But, as is always the case under this government, it was just another wasted opportunity-a wasted opportunity for greater fairness, a wasted opportunity to get greater workforce participation, a wasted opportunity to get people off welfare and into work and a wasted opportunity to address our capacity constraints and skills shortages. Our proposal also offered a choice of fortnightly payments. That is what our second reading amendment does. I tell you this: people, particularly in regional and rural Australia, need the money in their pockets on a fortnightly basis, not at the end of the year. That is why I urge members to support the second reading amendment that we have moved. A lump sum payment after July 2007, more than 12 months away, will not help with the weekly bills. I have said before that Labor was and is the party of true tax reform. We gave seven tax cuts in 13 years, including cutting the top rate from 60 per cent to 47 per cent and in every case reducing rates, not just thresholds. We returned more than bracket creep. We used tax policy not only as a redistributive mechanism but also as an anti-inflationary tool. Together with wages policy, we used it to break the back of inflation and reduce interest rates. In opposition, we have continued to argue the case for tax reform, but the reality is that tax reform will only happen if Labor is returned to office. Whilst on the question of tax reform, I want to talk about another missed opportunity in the budget, and that is the government's superannuation plan. ‘Plan' is their word, but the reality is that there is very little detail contained in the budget as to what is involved. Again, I remind the House that Labor is the party of true reform in this area. It was Labor that introduced compulsory superannuation, and it was fought every inch of the way by the Howard government and when they were in opposition. Despite embracing our scheme now, they have done nothing to continue the reform agenda. Super contributions, still at nine per cent, are insufficient to meet the intergenerational challenge of our ageing population and the associated costs. The fact is that the abolition of the exit tax on superannuation will benefit very few people. Most people do not have enough in their superannuation accounts to pass the existing tax free-threshold of $130,000. The big cost is the tax-free status of lump sums and annuities taken by people turning 60, with the reasonable benefit limit abolished. But there are some key questions that the government must answer if we are to advance this debate in a way that is good for the economy as well as for individuals. Will the proposals disproportionately benefit the very wealthy? Will the plan lead to a situation of different tax status for retirees over 60 continuing to work than for those below 60? Does it mean that those over 60 who can so arrange their affairs will not pay any tax at all? How sustainable is that with an ageing population? Will it lead to increases in consumption and therefore add to inflationary pressures? Could it result in people blowing their lump sum payments and coming back to claim the age pension? If it does, it is hardly a strategy to reduce the cost to the budget of an ageing population. Australia deserves open and honest answers to these questions to properly assess the impact and to consider alternatives. We need to have the proposals that the government is talking about run through the intergenerational model to determine both the income distribution and the cost implications over 40 years. We have the model; let us put the proposals through it. The government claims that it will cause long-term falls in pension and health costs, but where is the evidence for this? Let us see it. The basic issue for superannuation is that we have to lift the contributions above nine per cent. A better way to do this, I would suggest, would be to reduce or abolish the contributions tax. We have advocated it in recent years. Clearly, abolition of the contributions tax will cost more than the government's announced policy, but, again, it is worth considering it as a significant down payment. Senator Minchin talked about this. Has that work been modelled? If so, produce it. If not, let us do it. Let us run it through the 40-year model and see which one of them stacks up. This is a debate we have to have and, certainly, cutting the contribution tax would be the equivalent of lifting the compulsory contribution above nine per cent, with no cost to either the employee or the employer. It also represents real tax reform in relation to future, not present, earnings. It is a tax cut that goes to savings and is not inflationary. I would urge the government to produce that information so that we can have a serious debate about the best way to spend the tax cuts and reforms to superannuation as well. (Time expired).",65
49,Mr WINDSOR,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006 that is before the parliament. Many people in the electorate of New Englandand, I am sure, in other electorates as wellwould have been prepared to have given up some degree of tax relief for greater spending in the health area. Many surveys have been conducted which would suggest that people are crying out for better delivery of health services-and I am fully aware that a lot of those services are through the state governments. I do not want to enter into that debate, but I want to put on record the fact that, in my electorate particularly, people have raised that issue-that, if a surplus is left over after the legitimate costs of government, some of that money at least should be delivered into the health system, particularly for the training of professionals and obviously for capital facilities. This debate gives me the opportunity to talk about a number of tax issues, some of which are currently being deliberated on by members of the government. I am pleased again to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, at the table. He may well be subjected to something that he has heard before. I have to reinforce some of the issues I have raised before, because there does not seem to be any action at this time. But I am extremely confident that, with his support and recognition of these worthy issues, something will be done. I, of course, refer to the taxation treatment of the compensation/adjustment processes. As an aside, I was interested the other day that the Prime Minister referred to an adjustment package for the people of Beaconsfield. From memory, it was $8 million. The parliamentary secretary or the minister might discuss that briefly at the end of the debate. am interested in how that money would be expended and how the taxation treatment of that expenditure would be judged by the Australian Taxation Office. The major issue I would like to raise relates to a number of areas of income tax policy and to the personal taxation matters of particular individuals. The best, but not the only, example I can find is the treatment of compensation/adjustment moneys to people who have lost their water entitlements in a voluntary sense-although extreme pressures were applied-across a number of groundwater systems in New South Wales. Six valleys across New South Wales are taking a reduction in their water entitlements so that sustainability of the resource can be gained in the future. I am sure that most people, even though it creates a deal of hardship for those individuals, would recognise that what they are doing is for the public and environmental good and that it is for the sustainability of a resource-in this case, water. In that situation, the New South Wales government, the Commonwealth government and the irrigators or entitlement holders themselves agreed to a compensation package of $150 million. It was a three-way package. The state would put in $50 million, the Commonwealth would put in $50 million and the irrigators would put in $50 million in kind. Bear in mind that the irrigators were giving up a lot more than what this package was about-but it was about the total sum of money that they could garner from the governments. At the time that package was agreed to, no-one told the water entitlement holders that the Australian Tax Office would judge those payments of compensation for the loss of a capital asset as income and that they would have to pay personal tax in the year of receipt of those funds. Prior to that, accountI ants had been treating the payments as capital. There was no doubt in their minds and in the minds of many others-and I think also in the minds of many others within government who were wrestling with this particular problem-that the loss of a capital asset should be seen as an entitlement to be treated under the capital gains taxation umbrella and not under the income tax umbrella. I have raised this issue with the Prime Minister on a number of occasions. To give him credit, the Prime Minister on those occasions has responded, twice in writing, to the issue that others and I have raised. He has said that, as far as the government and the tax office are concerned, compensation payments to water entitlement holders are not treated as capital loss but as income, because these people are not exiting the industry. Prime Minister quoted a couple of examples-the dairy industry and the sugar industry-where essentially exit packages which have been put in place would be taxed under the capital gains umbrella but not under the income tax umbrella. By saying that, he was implying that these were different arrangements and you could not compare the two systems-one was for exit and the other was for a reduction in entitlement-even though some of these people are losing nearly all of their entitlement and will have to exit the irrigation industry, even though they may well remain farmers. However, the issue goes further than that. Currently, there is another assistance package available to those in my electorate and also in the electorate of the member for Gwydir, and I have been in contact with some of these people. It is the Brigalow assistance fund. This fund was put together by the New South Wales government to assist people to adjust to sustainability of the timBut, ber resource in the Pilliga scrub and in connection with the Brigalow timber asset. I might read from the deed of release and indemnity with which this package has come forward. However, essentially this package is to do the same thing, which is ‘to reduce a resource to a sustainable level', and a package to compensate those people has been put in place. Bear in mind that the Prime Minister has said on a couple of occasions now that reduction in entitlement is treated as income and exit is treated as capital. Clause 3 of the deed of release and indemnity of the Brigalow assistance fund says that the fund is to ‘provide assistance to individual businesses that have decided to exit the timber industry as a result of the creation of the community conservation area'-which has been created in the Brigalow area in the electorates of New England and Gwydir. The There is advice also that the tax office is treating as income those payments to those people to exit that industry for good sustainable and environmental reasons. That creates a degree of inconsistency of interpretation. We have a number of issues. We have water entitlement reductions being treated as income, timber exit being treated as income, dairy exit being treated as capital and sugar exit being treated as capital. Then, only last week, the Australian Taxation Office came out with a ruling on the fishing industry for where there is a reduction in the catchsimilar to these other issues-to gain sustainability of the resource for all these very good reasons. Lo and behold, that particular adjustment package will be treated as capital. So here again we get constant confusion. The only consistent part of these arrangements is the inconsistency of interpretation. I recognise that this is a difficult issue for the government and that it is trying to come to grips with it-and I compliment it for that. with 30 June racing upon us, this has to be rectified within the next month so that accountants et cetera can have a consistent interpretation regarding the way these matters are treated. There is another issue within the Namoi ground water precinct, where government money was granted to a number of irrigators. To start with, I think it came through the Namoi Valley adjustment process and eventually, to the best of my knowledge, it was subsumed into the Regional Partnerships arrangements. A number of irrigators received funds to put in a channel to alleviate the very same problem. There had been an overallocation of water and sustainability had to be arrived at. The approach of sustainability would mean a considerable loss of income-earning capacity. Therefore, the government assisted some of those people to channel water into what was called a hot spot so that the diminishment of their incomeearning capacity could be alleviated. I am told-and I inquired into this under freedom of information-that the receipt of that grant of moneys was tax free, and no-one has suggested anything to the contrary. It is another degree of inconsistency-government money being treated in three different ways. In fact, I am told, in the last case, GST was paid on the grant. I call upon the parliamentary secretary and the minister to really have a good look at this particular issue. If they are serious about natural resource management-and I think some of the aspects of the National Water Initiative and other natural resource management initiatives are positive-and about those longer term benefits being taken up, by the farm sector in particular, but other land users in general, then they must address this matter. You cannot have a circumstance where you say you are going to compensate people and come along a bit later, when the package has been put together, and say, ‘Sorry about that; we are going to tax you 40 per cent of the total arrangement.' That means, in many cases, that the Commonwealth's gratuity is going to be going back through the taxMr Fitzgibbon-Cyclone Larry grants won't be taxed.",69
50,Mr WINDSOR,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"The member for Hunter, a very prominent figure in tax matters, highlights that Cyclone Larry money will not be taxed-and, in my view, nor should it. But neither should these people who are giving up their assets, their incomeearning capacity, for the long-term good of the nation. To trivialise these people and say, ‘By the way, on the way past we're going to tax you. We'll give you some money to give up half your water'-87 per cent in one case-‘but on the way past we'll treat it as income in the year of receipt.' That is an absolute disgrace. What about the message it sends? The member for Hotham was talking about the message on superannuation earlier-having something that encourages people to save and then taxing them on the way through. This is exactly the same sort of thing. The message that we are sending is the wrong message. If we are serious about natural resource management policy into the future, we have to address these sorts of matters. The other issue that I would like to raise briefly relates to personal income tax. The Minister for Revenue, who is at the table, is very much aware of this. I am an admirer of the minister, but I cannot believe that he has allowed the bureaucracy to get this into a bill. I urge him to stand up against Treasury in future arrangements. Mr Fitzgibbon-No, the Treasurer!",72
51,Mr WINDSOR,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,The Treasurer or Treasury-there are many stories about that. The issue that I raise for the minister at the table is the treatment of fuel excise rebates under the BAS arrangements. The implications to the cash flow of the farm sector must be obvious. In one of my light-hearted moments I suggested that this has been deliberately put there so that the National Party and the National Farmers Federation can claim a victoryMr Fitzgibbon-Could be; good theory!,72
52,Mr WINDSOR,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"I am certain that the minister will see the error of his ways here and capitulate to those hard working ‘New Liberals' and the National Farmers Federation, that corner store of the ‘New Liberals', and rectify this matter. I think it is very important that it is rectified because it is ous that the cash flow impact on the farm sector is going to be severe. Mr Fitzgibbon-We need to see the bill soon to remove uncertainty.",73
53,Mr WINDSOR,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"I am introducing amendments to that legislation, although I am hopeful that the minister will recognise the error of his ways and change that. I cannot believe that the ‘New Liberals' have allowed that particular area of the legislation to even get into the document. I would have thought that they would have been part of the process of determining legislation. Hopefully, under their new arrangements, they can actually be part of the progressing and formulating of legislation, because it is pretty obvious that they have not been in this particular case. Or could it be a stunt, where the ‘Old Liberals' actually put up an issue, knowing full well that the ‘New Liberals' will want it changed? I am hopeful that it will be changed. The other issue that relates to taxation matters is the removal of the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme as of 1 July and the impact that that will have on the personal expenditure of country motorists. The minister would be aware that the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme was put in place to equalise the impact of the goods and services tax back in 2000. I applauded the government, as a state member of parliament, for doing that. And our good friends, the National Farmers Federation, applauded it at the time as well. That has been removed now-$270 million-and country motorists will bear the costs of that at the bowser. Contrary to the view that many in the government have put that the government are incapable of doing anything about fuel prices, that it is all a global matter and out of their hands, I believe that there is a lot that they could have done. This is a case where they are actually putting up fuel prices obvifor one sector of the community. And that sector will be country people, who will have to pay an extra 1c to 3c a litre. The great tragedy in this issue is that the ally of the ‘New Liberals', the National Farmers Federation, actually came out and said that the scheme was not working and was used as an organisation to suggest that it should not be in place, that it needed to be replaced, and supported the government's initiative. The one thing that the National Farmers Federation president, Peter Corish, did not say at the time was that farmers do not pay it. It was all very well to embrace this issue, knowing that the normal motorist in country Australia could pay it. His members were not going to pay it, but he was endorsing the removal of it so that the rest of country Australians would have to pay that additional tax. I urge the minister to listen to what people are saying on those matters. I think he has the capacity to listen to people. I wish him well in his new job. But I also urge the parliamentary secretary, who I am sure now is fully on top of these taxation matters. He is well known for his diversity of view on tax and entitlements. He is working very hard on the state ownership of water and the transferability of water, so I am sure he should be well on top of that. Mr Fitzgibbon-We want outcomes, though-outcomes!",73
54,Mr WINDSOR,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"The member for Hunter is quite right; we do want outcomes. The accountants in my electorate-and, I am sure, in Gwydir, Parkes and Riverina, those electorates which will be impacted by this taxation ruling-are saying the same thing: that we do require some outcomes on this issue.",73
55,Mr DUTTON,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (1.30 pm)-Can I begin by thanking all those members who have contributed to this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006. I even extend that courtesy to my old Independent friend, the member for New England, for his contribution, and I have taken on board all of his advice, as varied as it is. On a serious note, measures contained in this bill will cut personal income tax for all Australian taxpayers from 1 July 2006. Importantly, they will cut business tax by $3.7 billion over the next four years by substantially improving Australia's depreciation arrangements. Personal tax cuts are another step in comprehensive tax reform that has seen income tax cut previously in 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005. From 1 July this year, the marginal tax rates of 47 and 42 per cent will be reduced to 45 and 40 per cent respectively. In addition, this bill will increase tax thresholds, so that the 15 per cent tax rate will apply on income of up to $25,000, the 30 per cent tax rate will apply up to $75,000, the 40 per cent tax rate will apply up to $150,000, and the 45 per cent rate will apply to income thereafter. The low-income tax offset will be enhanced by increasing it up to $600 and the level of income where the offset will begin to phase out is increased from $25,000 from 1 July 2006. This means that those eligible for the full low-income tax offset will not pay tax until their annual income exceeds $10,000. As part of this debate, there has been some mischief by members opposite on the issue of the low-income tax offset. I place on the record that the entitlement to the lowincome tax offset is carefully targeted towards low-income earners and can be claimed upon assessment in a taxpayer's annual tax return. Claiming the low-income tax offset upon assessment avoids taxpayers incurring significant debts when they have an increase in income throughout the year. Labor's proposal to allow taxpayers to claim the low-income tax offset throughout the year will result in tax debts for taxpayers whose incomes increased throughout the year because they will have claimed too much low-income tax offset. The government has strategies to minimise the creation the of tax debts, while the opposition does exactly the opposite-it wants to create more. Senior Australians who are eligible for the senior Australians tax offset will now pay no tax on their annual income up to $24,867 for singles and up to $41,360 for couples. Overall, in percentage terms, the greatest tax cuts have been provided to low-income earners. These tax changes will ensure that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers face a top marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less over the forward estimates period. Reducing the top marginal tax rate and significantly increasing the top threshold will improve the competitiveness of Australia's tax system compared with other OECD countries. Australia's top marginal tax rate will be in line with the OECD average and the increase in the top threshold will place Australia 10th highest in the OECD. This package provides $36.7 billion of benefit to taxpayers over four years and reinforces Australia's reputation as a low-tax country. These tax cuts significantly restructure the personal income tax system to increase disposable incomes to enhance incentives for participation and to improve Australia's international competitiveness. The measures in this bill will also substantially improve Australia's depreciation arrangements by increasing the diminishing value rate for determining depreciation deductions from 150 per cent to 200 per cent. The effect of the measure is to provide the equivalent of a 33 per cent increase in the allowable depreciation rate for all eligible assets. This will increase incentives for tralian business to invest in new plant and equipment and make it easier for businesses to keep pace with new technology and remain competitive. Investment is a key element of productivity growth and, hence, of economic growth. The increased depreciation rates under the diminishing value method align depreciation deductions for tax purposes more closely with the actual decline in the economic value of an asset, which will lead to improved resource allocation in the economy. This is consistent with the government's tax policy strategy of ensuring that the tax system has minimal effect on the allocation of resources in the economy. Taxpayers will get the benefit of the improved depreciation arrangements for assets acquired on or after 10 May 2006. For the reasons I have outlined above, I commend this bill to the House.",74
56,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED,"Before I put the question, I remind honourable members of their obligation to rise in their place when they seek the call.

61,Mr FITZGIBBON,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"Hunter) (1.42 pm)I am very happy to take this opportunity to make a contribution on the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006. What an important piece of legislation it is. It is so important that the govI ernment wanted to deny me an opportunity to make a contribution on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006 in the consideration in detail stage. What I wanted to say on that bill was how disappointed I was that the Treasurer did not turn up to summarise debate on that bill. Members of the House will recall the Treasurer coming in here to introduce the bill great fanfare. He was all done up in his regal thatbest. Mr Turnbull- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.

I am concerned about the forecasting capability of this government. The Treasurer was happy to come in here and deliver a budget and happy to come in here and deliver the tax cut bill, but he was not happy to come back in here and sum up on those tax bills, notwithstanding that we had some very important questions to put.

87,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,The member for O'Connor should come to the bill.,78
88,Mr TUCKEY,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"But, as a consequence, I am more than willing to help him out with a clear and concise reference to this legislation. In so doing, I refer of course to the planatory memorandum. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006 would amend the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 to provide for custodial penalties for foreign fishing offences in those parts of Australia's territorial sea that are within the Australian fishing zone, within the meaning of the FMA, or within any area of Australian jurisdiction, within the meaning of the TSFA. Those, of course, are the abbreviations for those acts I have already mentioned. In general, the waters that would therefore become subject to the proposed custodial penalties are the waters from three to 12 nautical miles offshore from the Australian mainland or from most islands, including those in the Torres Strait. For the external territories, all waters out to 12 nautical miles will be subject to the proposed custodial penalties. The waters within three nautical miles of the coast or which are internal waters, such as bays, rivers and sounds, are subject to the fisheries jurisdiction of a state or the Northern Territory, which have the power to impose custodial penalties for foreign fishing offences in these waters and in most instances have done so. Illegal foreign fishing vessel incursions threaten Australia's sovereign interests, posing threats such as serious quarantine risks, illegal immigration, importation of prohibited goods, depletion of fish stocks, degradation of marine protected areas and targeting of endangered species. (Quorum formed) Let me continue with the information that the shadow minister would normally provide to the House. The added deterrents of custodial penalties for foreign fishing offences would help to reduce these threats. The bill, if enacted, would further strengthen the ex- measures against illegal foreign fishing announced by the government in the 2006 budget. Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone, the EEZ, which extends generally from 12 to 200 nautical miles offshore, has been excluded from the ambit of the new penalties in order to comply with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which Australia is a party. Article 73 of the convention requires that coastal state penalties for violations of fishery laws and regulations in the EEZ may not include imprisonment in the absence of agreements to the contrary by the states concerned; however, this prohibition does not apply in the territorial sea. Mr Gavan O'Connor-You're just reading from the explanatory memorandum. You're a former fisheries minister. Can't you",78
89,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,Order! The member for Corio!,78
90,Mr TUCKEY,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"This is direct from the explanatory memorandum: It has been long standing legal practice in Australia not to impose custodial penalties for offences that are subject to strict liability. Accordingly, the Bill would amend the FMA and TSFA on the basis that the new custodial penalties would apply only to fault based indictable offences. Having read that out on behalf of the shadow minister, I might now revert to the comments I wanted to make about those matters, in which he may even find some grounds for agreement. I have to point out that over many years in the state of Western Australia the financial penalties that the United Nations convention required for these foreign fishing incursions always carried a rider, as they do with other offences in Western Australia-if the fine was not paid, each $50, for example, represented a day in custody. So many people have been given custodial sentences not because of the crime, which is subject to a final penalty, but because of their failure to pay that penalty. Whilst I support the government-and, hopefully, the more senior officials and people involved-in respect of this outrageous situation, both environmentally and commercially, of the incursion of foreign fishing tities into our traditional waters, I must point out that for the lesser individual, the crewman, this process of incarceration has not worked. I do not want to say this in a critical sense, but the reality is that while you are in an Australian jail you get pocket money and, unfortunately, the pocket money frequently exceeds the wages that some of them would have been paid in their home state. Whilst I guess they do not enjoy the period of incarceration, they are flown home in a charter jet and with quite a bit of money. I was further confronted with this situation in Darwin where, after arresting the boats, the practice was to tow them into the harbour and to then leave the crew on board. The crew would be onboard in conditions which would be identical to those were they to return to their home port, because many, if not all, did not have accommodation on land in their home port; they continued to live on the vessel. Of course, they were provided with stores-and might have been given significantly more-but there was pressure from certain parties to bring these people ashore and to accommodate them in a much more salubrious way. So I am pleased to say to the House that I think these penalties will be a great deterrent to the senior crew of boats that are there to collect the catches of the smaller vessels and freeze them and treat them. Whilst I think that will be an excellent deterrent, I am encouraged, after questioning the minister. that our more practical responses will be the front line of protection. My recollection of the former Labor government's administration in respect of the prevention of these fishing practices was to use Customs assets-vessels worth $10 million, $20 million or $30 million at the point of launching-to arrest and tow cockleboats into Broome or Darwin, which were the most logical places to bring them. I always had en- grave concerns about bringing those vessels so close to the coastline, but that was the practice of that government, as it was the previous government. The new policy and a lot of the new funding-and this is only a component of it-will make sure we have the capacity to make arrests and that facilities for the eventual destruction of these vessels are as far away as possible from our mainland. Other vessels, of much lesser value than those that should be making the arrests, should be available for towing and for the application of other parts of the law of the sea, with which this nation must comply. All in all, it is with some pleasure that I support this legislation. I reserve my right to continue my remarks after question time and the MPI, to which I hope the people who are to speak will turn up on time.",78

92,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and refers to matters dealt with by him in question time yesterday. Deputy Prime Minister, doesn't this plan released today reveal that when the Queensland Liberal Party takeover of the Queensland National Party takes effect, the Queensland Liberals will ‘remain and continue to be a part of the Liberal Party of Australia while Queensland Nationals will disappear,' according to this document, into the Liberal Party organisation? Doesn't this mean that the members for Dawson, Maranoa, Wide Bay and Hinkler are about to become either members of the Liberal Party or members of no political party? If one National Party defection caused the loss of one seat at the isterial table, how many National Party ministers will go now, once the Queensland Nats cease to exist?",80

94,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister inform the House whether he has further information regarding workers at the Teys Bros meat works?,80
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question. The member is of course the chairman of the government members committee dealing with issues of workplace relations and he has a very long and continuing interest in workplace relations. I was asked yesterday by the member for Jagajaga about workers being stood down at the Teys Bros meat works in Naracoorte in South Australia. The member for Jagajaga suggested in her question that 260 Australian workers at the meat works had had their employment reduced to four days a week with a reduction in pay because of a shortage of stock. She also suggested that overseas workers brought to Australia on temporary 457 visas are being given enough slaughter work and extra work, such as night cleaning, to get them a full working week in order to meet their visa requirements. I indicated yesterday that I was not personally aware of the facts of this matter and that I would seek to check them, as long experience has told me not to automatically accept what is put to me in this place. I am therefore very pleased to inform the House that I have had an opportunity to check the facts and to get some advice and on this occasion the suggestions minmade by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are completely wrong. I am advised that Teys Bros employs its Australian and overseas workers on the same Australian workplace agreements. Consistent with the normal practice for this industry, the AWAs of both Australian and foreign workers alike include provisions where workers can be legally stood down on days where there is insufficient work, and where this occurs both Australian and foreign workers are stood down and they are not paid. There is no discrimination, I am told, between the Australian and foreign workers-which is directly contrary to what was suggested by the member for Jagajaga-and that is what happened in this case. Ms Macklin interjecting",80
96,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,80
97,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Responding to normal seasonal variations in its business, Teys was required to stand down all workers from a five-day shift to a four-day shift in recent weeks. Again, contrary to the suggestion from the member for Jagajaga, both foreign and Australian workers were affected. The member for Jagajaga also suggested that foreign workers had been offered extra work to keep them in full-time employment to comply with their visa conditions. Again, I am told this is simply not the case. I am told that at times Teys Bros have offered their employees, both locally and foreign sourced, the opportunity to do unskilled labour on the days they were stood down from normal duties. Contrary again to the suggestion from the member for Jagajaga, it appears that a small group of both foreign and Australian workers took up these opportunities-five foreigners and five Australian workersagain, no discrimination between the two groups. Again, contrary to the suggestion of the member for Jagajaga that this was due to a visa requirement which placed foreign workers in a more privileged position than local workers, this offer appears to have been made to both types of workers in an attempt by the company to treat all their workers fairly-and for this the government does not seek in any way to condemn the company. In fact, I am advised that this fair treatment amount to a technical breach of the visa requirements because the foreign workers are required to be employed only in the skilled positions that they are sponsored to undertake. DIMA officials are talking to the company about that. The opposition has been prepared to have a go at Teys Bros without getting its facts right. That is typical of the dishonest fear campaign being run on matters of industrial relations by not only the Leader of the Opposition but now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is worth telling the House a few facts about this wonderful Australian employer and wonderful Australian company. Teys Bros is the largest Australian owned beef processor and it is the largest privately owned company in Queensland. It owns six plants across Australia, in Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory, and it employs about 2,100 workers. Nationally the company employs 11 apprentices and 218 trainees, all of whom are Australian. Teys Bros is the largest single employer in Naracoorte, providing direct employment for 269 people, of whom less than 10 per cent are foreign workers, and generating $11 million in wages that flow directly into the local community.

I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to the release of the agreement that will see the Liberal Party in Queensland take over the Queensland National Party.

Deputy Prime Minister, isn't it the truth that your political party has already collapsed, just as Australia's trade performance has collapsedMrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.

106,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am happy to answer either part but, as far as the second part of the question is concerned, our trade performance is not collapsing. The figures today reflect a reduction in the trade deficit and an increase in exports, and you know it. Workplace Relations",82
107,Mrs MARKUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister advise the House how Work Choices interacts with state occupational health and safety laws? Is the minister aware of any alternative views?,82
108,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Greenway for her question. I note that the unemployment rate of 4.5 per cent in her electorate of Greenway is below the national average, and almost half what it was at 8.8 per cent when Labor was in government. That is a result of the strong economic management of this government, which has led to more jobs for people not only in Greenway but right throughout Australia. The honourable member asked me about the continuing absurd claims made by the opposition and the unions about occupational health and safety under Work Choices. I again reiterate to the House that occupational health and safety remains a responsibility of the states and territories and indeed is legislated for by the states and territories in Australia. But this has not stopped those opposite and others from running around suggesting otherwise. We have had Labor's great new hope, Bill Shorten, running around suggesting that occupational health and safety training is somehow at risk under Work Choices. Indeed, on Sky News on 22 May, Mr Shorten had this exchange with David Spears, who not. asked: ‘Do you accept that workers at this mine or any mine or any workplace will still be able to receive union provided safety training under the new laws?' Mr Shorten responded, ‘No. I don't accept that.' That was pretty clear. But I was very surprised recently when I came across a union collective agreement which was lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate, I am advised, on 12 May this year-a union collective agreement lodged since the introduction of the Work Choices legislation on 27 March. When I look in this agreement I find clause 26Mr Brendan O'Connor interjecting",82
109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Gorton!,82
110,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I see clause 26, which is headedMr Brendan O'Connor interjecting",82
111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Gorton is warned!,83
112,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"‘Occupational health and safety'. Clause 26.2 states: ... the Victorian Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004, its regulations and associated safety legislation will apply. And it goes on to say: All employees will participate in safety training programs, including detailed ery and project safety procedures. So this clearly sets out that the Victorian occupational health and safety law will continue to prevail. Not only that, when I turn over to the next page I find the following in clause 26.11: Occupational health and safety representatives will be provided with five days paid training attendance at an occupational health and safety course consistent with the provisions of the cupational Health and Safety Act 2004. In other words, union training, if that is the choice, will continue to be provided as part of that occupational health and safety training if that is what the Victorian legislation prescribes. As I said, this was a surprising agreement in light of the comments from the opposition and, particularly, in light of that interview with Mr Shorten on the television recently. When I turn to the back of this agreement to see who the signatories are, I see that this agreement, lodged on 12 May, was signed, for and on behalf of the Australian Workers Union, by the assistant secretary of the Australian Workers Union. So we have Mr Shorten and others opposite going around Australia saying-as Mr Shorten did on Sky News-‘I don't accept that workers will still be able to receive union provided safety training,' when his own union is negotiating an agreement under Work Choices which provides specifically for the continued operation of occupational health and safety laws and, indeed, training in Australia. This says once again what the unions and those opposite know, and that is that occupational health and safety is a matter for the states and territories in Australia and nothing in Work Choices will stop training being provided by a union if that is what the parties decide.

127,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Attorney General in his capacity representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Would the Attorney-General advise the House of government initiatives to enable companies to meet skills shortages by bringing in workers on temporary visas? Is the Attorney aware of the level of support for these programs?,84
128,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question because I know that the member for Blair, like many members of this House, appreciates particularly the importance of temporary workers entering Australia as a source of labour, particularly in regional areas, where there are skills shortages that cannot be met in the local labour markets. Many leaders of state and territory governments around Australia have forcibly put those views over time. It is very obvious that skills shortages which are left unmet often deny other Australians work opportunities. In these cases, companies can turn to temporary workers from overseas and use particularly the form of visa known as a 457. Employers are particularly supportive of these measures. Without them many of those companies would have trouble in continuing to expand their operations or maintain them. Often that would put at risk the jobs of Australians. It is for this reason that the governwas ment has been responding positively to community and business needs. But that support is not universal. The Labor Party have made no secret of their dislike for the temporary entry visa system. They are dressing these arguments up in ways which I think bring them no merit. The Leader of the Opposition has made it clear that he does not want companies bringing in qualified workers and welders. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been critical of workers entering under the 457 system and so has the member for Watson. Ms Plibersek interjecting",85

130,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am interested that the member for Sydney is speaking about this matter, because there are other members of this House who recognise the value of people coming in under the temporary work visas, and they even write at times to the minister on behalf of their constituents. Ms Plibersek interjecting",85
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sydney is warned.,85
132,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to see her remain, because I make the point that there are numbers of members who write to the minister on behalf of constituents advancing the very reasons that this government gives for this program. In fact, I have a letter here from the member for Sydney. The member for Sydney wrote to the minister on 19 April. She said that she was concerned that a constituent could not expand his restaurant business until he could bring in a chef. She went on to say that her constituent had employed extra staff to work in expanding the business. She went on and said he had to turn down a lease on prime restaurant space because he not able to expand his restaurant until he had received the approval. We know where the Labor Party stands on these matters. There are some members who go out and argue on behalf of their constituents that the visa system should be expanded, while there are others out there suggesting that these measures do not benefit the Australian community, do not create jobs and put jobs at risk-when nothing could be further from the truth, as the member for Sydney knows. Export Crops",85
133,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.26 pm)My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware of a recent government publication Managing vertebrate pests: rodents, which shows rats undermine export crops, damaging trade by up to $26 million a year, and which describes Queensland canefield rats as a rising threat? Is the minister taking any action to deal with the emerging threat from Queensland rats?",85
134,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for his question. These people seriously put themselves forward as the alternative government in Australia. What the publication proves is the extent to which the government does go to assist Australian exporters to be as competitive and efficient as possible. And I think that the member for Hotham would know all about rats. Economy,86
135,Mr LAMING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline to the House recent data on the Australian economy? Treasurer, what does this indicate about the Australian economic outlook?",86
136,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question. I can inform him that today's international trade in goods and services figures show that the trade deficit narrowed to $1.1 billion, led by an increase in exports of five per cent or $799 million. The rise in exports was largely due to a solid increase in commodities exports, although, of course, the impact of Cyclone Glenda, which hit the Western Australian coast in late March and early April, would still be depressing exports from the North West Shelf and from the Pilbara. Over the past three years Australia's mining industry has invested around $31.6 billion in increasing its productive capacity, this will lead to an increase in export volumes over the course of the year and into next year. The RBA financial aggregates were also released today. What they showed was that business credit rose by 1.9 per cent to be 17.2 per cent higher over the year. This shows that business is borrowing solidly for investment but that it is in a very strong position in relation to those borrowings with the share of profits at near historical highs in the Australian economy. Conversely, household credit is slowing, rising by one per cent in April to be 12.8 per cent higher over the year. What we see in these particular figures is an improvement on the export front. We see strong business investment in the Australian economy and moderating personal credit growth, which is consistent with the household sector slowing. This is important as the economy rebalances itself from domestic sources of growth to external sources of growth. Supported by a strong global economy over the years which are ahead, we should see that rebalancing continue. Prospects for the Australian economy are strong. The government's strong fiscal position is contributing to savings in Australia. The fact is that we have now reduced Labor's $96 billion of net debt to zero and are saving $8 billion in interest payments, the important tax cuts which are due to take effect in JulyMr Tanner interjecting",86
137,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and the baby bonus, which no doubt the member for Melbourne has just taken advantage of. I look forward to him writing and thanking the government for the baby bonus that it introduced. And can I tell him that we wish he has many more children; we would be happy to pay him many more baby bonuses. These policies for famiand lies and these policies in relation to tax changes will support the Australian economy in the years which are ahead. The important thing for the Australian economy is this: strong, disciplined economic management. Nothing could be more important than keeping the Labor Party in opposition when it comes to strong economic management so that Australians have the opportunities of great jobs into the future. Workplace Relations",86
138,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the government's $55 million advertising campaign, which included the Work Choices booklet, which stamps the following entitlements-public holidays, rest breaks, incentive based payments and bonuses, annual leave loadings, allowances, penalty rates, shift/overtime loadings-as protected by law. I also refer to clause 20 of the Spotlight 2c an hour AWA, which includes: ‘This expressly excludes the operation of protected award conditions with respect to public holidays, rest breaks, incentive based payments and bonuses, annual leave loading, monetary allowances, penalty rates, loadings for overtime or shiftwork.'

145,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on recent political developments in East Timor?,87
146,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to thank the member for Fadden for his question and for his interest. I think members of the House may have heard already this morning that President Gusmao has declared a state of grave crisis in East Timor. He has announced that he will be formally assuming the sole responsibility for the areas of defence and national security for a period of 30 days. He is doing so in his constitutional capacity as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of East Timor. I note that the President has appealed to all groups to hand over weapons to authorities, particularly to international forces. He has also foreshadowed some ministerial changes, and I understand they are being considered during the course of today. Although there are still clearly problems with security, nevertheless the Australian military presence in East Timor has created an environment where these kinds of political discussions and decisions can take place and where the East Timorese can organise themselves appropriately politically. Political reconciliation is obviously going to be the key to resolving the current crisis and to ensuring that East Timor has a stable future. I commend the leadership of East Timor for upholding the rule of law and for operating, as they are clearly and rightly endeavouring to do, within the confines of their own constitution. We would, of course, urge all sides, whilst they may have differences, to act in the best interests of the nation in endeavouring to try to reconcile those interests. Our ambassador and Brigadier Slater during the course of this morning had a meeting with Prime Minister Alkatiri and these messages have been reinforced at that meeting with Prime Minister Alkatiri. The meeting I understand was a friendly, constructive and positive meeting. It was the first meeting that Brigadier Slater had had with Prime Minister Alkatiri and I am glad it went well. I, for my part, have remained in constant contact with my East Timorese counterpart, Jose Ramos Horta. We do continue to receive reports of opportunistic gang violence in Dili. Certainly that was quite a problem during the latter part of yesterday. As Brigadier Slater said, some days will be worse than others. We have to expect that there will be difficulties from time to time. I do not think any of us should underestimate the complexity of the situation on the ground-the different fissures that there are in East Timorese society and the need to try and reconcile those. The Australian troops in East Timor, though, have made considerable progress. They have secured the centres where internally displaced people are located. They are doing a very good job in patrolling the streets. They have collected some 400 weapons so far, which is a great credit to them, but it does say something about the number of weapons there are out there. We are continuing to deliver immediate humanitarian assistance to East Timor, particularly through non-government organisations and United Nations agencies. Food and water have been delivered to tens of thousands of people. From today, Australian Defence Force C130 flights will deliver extra food and water supplies into East Timor. Brigadier Slater, our ambassador and others in East Timor deserve a high degree of praise and credit for what they are doing, and ultimately what they are doing is assisting the people of East Timor to get their lives back together again and to give the country a good future.",87

Would the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House how the government is working for a successful conclusion to the current round of global trade talks? How will the new global trade deal help Australia's exporters?,88
152,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cowper for his question and recognise his keen interest in improving the opportunities for Australian exporters across the world through the multilateral trade negotiations called the Doha Round. Of course, the member for Cowper has many industries in his area, manufacturing industries as well as agricultural industries, that want better access into global markets. That is what the Australian government is looking for in seeking an ambitious outcome to this round of negotiations. It is our No. 1 trade priority and has been for a number of years. This round was launched in 2001, there have been a series of meetings and it is fast reaching a point in time where it must be concluded. There is only one way that it is going to be concluded successfully and to the satisfaction of Australian exporters, and that is if the major players and those countries that have got a contribution to make begin to make the political commitment that needs to be made now so that we can progress. Last week whilst overseas I chaired a meeting of key trade ministers, including those from the European Union and the United States, who are core to this negotiation, to set up a roadmap, if you like, through June and July. By the end of June we need to have achieved the modalities for agricultural market access and non-agricultural market access to be able to achieve our deadlines this year. It is now time those major players closely engaged so they can scope up the sorts of levels of commitment and compromise that are going to be needed to see this deal done. As I indicated, this round is our No. 1 trade policy priority. A successful come to this round would mean hundreds of billions of dollars of improved global welfare that Australia could participate in. incredibly important for our agricultural industries and obviously Australia's farmers to get better access to markets, particularly those in the European Union. We as a government have consistently over the years improved the circumstances in Australia for our exporters. We removed about $3½ billion worth of wholesale sales tax off the back of our exports and we have improved the economic environment in which they are operating in Australia to put them on a stronger platform to launch into markets across the world. This is an opportunity to remove on a multilateral basis many of those barriers in many of those markets across the world. Australia is playing a key role in these negotiations. We call on our major colleagues now to make the political commitment in the coming months to achieve the goals not just for our exporters and our economies but also to help lift millions of people out of poverty in the developing world. Success will create more opportunities for Australian exporters to help them create more jobs in their industries and ultimately to put more dollars into the pockets of working Australian families. Workplace Relations",89
153,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to a statement by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on Friday of last week in response to the Spotlight 2c an hour AWA: ... the evidence from the Office of Employment Advocate is that the vast majority of agreements ... continue to contain things like penalty rates and overtime. I refer to the Senate estimates earlier this week, which revealed that 6,263 AWAs have out- been lodged with the Office of Employment Advocate since the commencement of the government's legislation. Of those AWAs It is sampled, 100 per cent-all of themexcluded at least one protected award condition, 63 per cent removed penalty rates, 52 per cent removed shiftwork loading and 16 per cent removed all award protected conditions. Prime Minister, why did the minister not tell the Australia public the truth last week?",89
154,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not tell this parliament the truth about that company in South Australia. I therefore do not accept on face value what the member for Perth has claimed my colleague has said. While I am on my feet, what I can inform the member for Perth to be the case is that the sample survey of 250 AWAs in April showed that 84 per cent of the AWAs had higher wage rates than the comparable awards. Mental Health",90
155,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister advise the House on the government's commitment to improving mental health services?,90
156,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Forde for her question and for her interest in this area. I can inform her and the House that it is estimated that, in any one year, up to one in five Australians can suffer a significant mental health problem but that up to a half of all mental health problems are not effectively treated. We know that mental health problems can be hard to diagnose, difficult to treat and slow to cure, but this is a reason to increase our efforts in mental health care, not to reduce them. As part of its commitment to the Council of Australian Governments mental health program, the federal government recently announced $1.9 billion in additional mental health spending. Amongst other things, Medicare will be expanded to allow GPs and psychiatrists to refer patients to psychologists. It is estimated that this will mean an additional 400,000 psychologist consultations a year. GP and psychiatric practices will be supported to employ mental health nurses and it is estimated that an additional 36,000 patients a year will be helped through this measure. As well, the government will fund an extra 420 mental health nurse training places and an additional 200 clinical psychology training places, and the government will further expand the Better Outcomes in Mental Health program in regional areas. More good news from the Howard government: yesterday, thanks to the good work of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, who is momentarily absent from this parliament, I can say that an agreement to provide $54 million to the Youth Mental Health Foundation was finalised. Much mental health care in public hospitals or in supported accommodation remains, of course, the responsibility of the states, but I am confident that the federal government doing much more in its area of responsibilities will encourage the states to do what is needed in their area of responsibility. Workplace Relations",90
157,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall the Cowra Abattoir case which occurred during the first week of operation of the government's industrial relations legislation? Is the Prime Minister aware of a May 2006 Office of Workplace Services report entitled ‘Cowra abattoirs: report of an investigation into alleged breaches of the Workplace Relations Act 1996'? Prime Minister, doesn't that report recommend that no further action be taken and conclude that the employer had operational reasons for terminating employees and their conduct did not constitute a breach of the government's legislation? When will the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations finally admit this?",90
158,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is that I have seen reports of a report by the Office of Workplace Services. I have also seen a press statement released today by the Office of Workplace Services which states ‘that, despite media reports today to the contrary, the investigation into Cowra Abattoir Pty Ltd is yet to be finalised'. Now that the member for Perth, with his customary searching analysis, has raised the question of the Cowra Abattoir, let me say something about this company and let me say something about the campaign that is being waged by the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party, who apparently believe it is better for potentially 200 people to lose their jobs entirely because a firm goes out of business than it is for a firm to adjust its workforce down, retain the majority of them and keep the business going. Mr Stephen Smith-Admit it.",91
159,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Perth has asked his question.,91
160,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The truth is that what has happened at Cowra Abattoir reflects a situation that obtained before Work Choices was introduced and will obtain irrespective of what industrial relations system this country has. The reality is that Cowra Abattoir has been suffering financial difficulties for some time. I table a letter dated 16 February 2006 from Cowra Abattoir to all its employees which outlines the reasons the company came to the conclusion that it had to get by with a lesser number of employees. The truth is that, no matter what industrial relations system you have, there comes a time with many firms when either an adjustment in the size of the workforce or some adjustment in the conditions under which some of the workforce are employed is necessary in order to keep a firm going. I might remind the member for Perth that when his beloved industrial relations system governed this country in the early 1990s it did not stop a million Australians being thrown out of work because of the recession we had to have. The truth is that the attitude of the Labor Party is that it is better that everybody lose their job because the firm goes broke than there be some adjustment to the workforce to keep a firm going. No matter what generality of strong economic conditions we may have obtained in this country, there will always be some firms, through some combination of reasons, that are doing poorly. To suggest that when a firm is operating uneconomically it has no right to alter the structure of its workforce, it has no right to ask its workforce to accept a changed operation and it has no right in the end, regrettable though it might be, to retrench some of its workforce, but that it has to maintain all of its workforce at the same level of remuneration with the inevitable consequence that the firm is going to go out of business, defies rationality. It is that kind of thinking that helped throw a million people out of work when the Leader of the Opposition was the employment minister of this country. Avian Influenza",91
161,Dr WASHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on action the government has taken to combat avian influenza in our region? Are there any alternative policies?,91
162,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member. Being a medical doctor, I know he is very interested in the issue. Since December 2003, there have been 224 cases of avian flu and 127 deaths from it. Last week the WHO importantly confirmed seven cases leading to six deaths in the northern part of Sumatra and it was suspected by the WHO that these deaths were caused by human-tohuman infections among people living in very cramped conditions, although the WHO has gone on to say there is no evidence that this case indicates the virus can be spread easily between humans. Nevertheless, that incident is a salutary warning that this is a very live and serious issue. Two days ago, the Indonesian government confirmed six more infections, including three deaths, elsewhere in Indonesia. Australia is taking a leading role in dealing with this issue in the region. We spent $140 million over four years to combat pandemics and emerging infectious diseases. We have been working with APEC since 2001 on assisting the region to prepare for this problem. On 7 and 8 June, Australia will lead and fund the APEC pandemic response exercise, which will test regional coordination and preparedness and identify where we can significantly improve emergency communications in the region. Eight economies are going to participate: China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan-or Chinese Taipei, as we say in APEC-Vietnam and also Chile. Finally, the honourable member asked if there were any alternative views. As was pointed out by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry the other day, I am delighted to report there are not any alternative views. The member for Griffith is in lockstep with the government on this issue, so much so that, as the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry pointed out, he published on Labor's web site, interestingly enough on 11 September last year, words which are simply lifted in slabs from the World Health Organisation, the American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and, I think, very flatteringly, from our own health minister's documents as well. On the face of it, you would expect us to welcome the opposition simply plagiarising the work of the government and other institutions, but it does remind me to remind the House that some 10 years ago the Labor Party made allegations against a Liberal still MP-I think he was the member for Cowan at the time-of plagiarism. Let me remind the Labor Party that they dubbed it shameful and a massive deceit. They even went so far as to move a motion in the House to have that member and the plagiarised work referred to a parliamentary committee. I wonder if the House remembers that. It begs the question whether the Labor Party takes the same view today about members plagiarising the work of others, as the member for Griffith has done, and whether the Leader of the Opposition will this time have the courage to move a motion to refer the member for Griffith and his plagiarism to a parliamentary committee. Wheat Exports Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (2.57 pm)My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I refer the minister to his personal explanationMr MCGauran interjecting Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-You just watch it there, Macca!",91
163,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Corio has the call. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-I refer the minister to his personal explanation to the House yesterday concerning his endorsement of work on alternatives to the single desk for wheat by industry body Single Vision. Did the minister meet with directors or officers of Single Vision prior to the commencement of its single desk review in March this year? Was he informed of the organisation's plan to commission this work?,92
164,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, the government welcomes the views of stakeholders. There are a great many opinions and views being expressed, from within the industry especially, with regard to future arrangements for the single desk. The government has not endorsed anybody's view; we have heard many people. I am stopped often as I walk around the countryside, as my colleagues are. A lot of people come up to us; a lot of views are put to us officially and ficially. We have said on any number of occasions that the government endorses the single desk so long as it is of benefit to wheat growers and is in the national interest. Mr Tanner interjecting",93
165,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne is warned.,93
166,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not productive to speculate on what the changes might be in the future. We are waiting for the Cole report before doing so. In regard to Single Vision, can I remind the honourable member that it is an entity associated with the Grains Research and Development Corporation, it is funded out of levies and it is an industry body. Just as members of the Grains Council of Australia and the Grains Research and Development Corporation put views to me, so has Single Vision. I am not going to close my door to anybody. Instead, I will respect industry views, but the government has not concluded its own views. Whaling",93
167,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister inform the House of recent steps the government has taken to strengthen the protection of whales? Are there any alternative approaches?,93
168,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. She and I, as representatives of electorates which have significant whale-watching industries, are very interested in the preservation of whales and in ensuring their well-being. This government has taken a world lead in promoting the conservation of whales. We have been very active in progressing whale conservation domestically and through international fora, particularly the International unofWhaling Commission. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, is currently visiting a range of Pacific nations seeking support for the conservation of whales in the run-up to the next meeting of the IWC, to be held in a couple of weeks time. There is a very real possibility that prowhaling nations will have the majority at the upcoming IWC meeting and will seek resolutions to ultimately bring about a return to commercial whaling. We have to take this upcoming round of meetings very seriously. There is a risk that we could slip back on what has been achieved to date. So Senator Campbell's current mission is a very important one-to seek to shore up support for what has been achieved to date and, hopefully, take the matter further. The honourable member asked whether there were any alternative policies. In this instance the Labor Party do have some alternative views. They took little interest in whaling when they were in government. In fact, no Labor minister ever bothered to attend the International Whaling Commission meetings. Now their only solution to these problems is to take legal action-or similar responses. I was interested to note, however, that not allMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. As amusing as it is to have a Queensland Nat ask about endangered species",93
169,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member will come to his point of order. Mr Albanese-I would draw the minister back to standing order 104, on relevance.",94
170,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. The question was phrased in two parts. I believe the minister is in order. I call the minister.,94
171,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I am responding to the element of the question that asked about alternative policies. I was referring to the fact that not all members of the Labor parties around the world follow the views of the opposition in relation to the value of legal action to endeavour to prevent the exploitation of whales. Indeed, New Zealand's delegate to the International Whaling Commission is a former New Zealand Labour Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey Palmer. He also spent some time on the International Court of Justice. He was quoted recently as saying: We've been looking at the legal theories that are available against the Japanese for some months. There is no legal theory that is available that can prevent, in our view, the Japanese from doing whatMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. He may not know whether he is a Queensland Nat or a Queensland New Liberal, but we know who we are, Mr Speaker.",94
172,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member will resume his seat. That is not a point of order.,94
173,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is clear that the Labor Party are barren when it comes to dealing with issues such as the conservation of whales. Their only policy has been rebutted conclusively by their colleagues in other parts of the world. It is time they got on and backed Senator Ian Campbell and the Australian government in its actions before the International Whaling Commission to try to preserve and protect this wonderful species. Indigenous Communities,94
174,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs aware that in 1989 the Queensland Auditor-General effectively had no problems with any of the 28 Aboriginal community councils? At the time all were receiving back-up from a full government department, an Aboriginal coordination council and an ‘on location' information and advisory officer carrying out continuous audit on service delivery and expenditures. Is the minister aware that incoming Labor governments abolished all three of these essential support services? Is the minister further aware that 1980s Queensland legislation provided the mechanism by which Aboriginal community residents could own their own homes, shops, farms and businesses? Is the minister aware that this was also abolished, reducing every one of the three million hectares of DOGIT lands to collective ownership, now owned by trustees appointed by, and at the convenience of, the Queensland minister? Mr Hardgrave-That's communism.",94
175,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That's a very good comment.,94
176,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,94
177,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Finally, is the minister aware",94
178,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will come to his question.,94
179,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have been interrupted continuously, Mr Speaker.",94
180,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will come to his question.,94
181,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,94
182,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right! Government members-That's a good question.,94
183,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Kennedy has the call.,95
184,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I doubt it, Mr Speaker. Finally, is the minister aware that escalating group violence has precipitated the reintroduction of the old racially discriminatory legislation banning alcohol? Since parents have no rights to force their children to go to school, education levels have sunk to their lowest levels in 10 years. Essential services have failed to such an extent that house building in one community has fallen from 13 houses per year to two per year and occupancy rates are soaring to over 15 people per home. Could the minister seriously look at intervening in Queensland and protecting communities such as Mornington Island from Queensland's continuing maladministration?",95
185,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question and his obvious clear understanding of the issues, dating back a long time. I wonder who the minister was at the time, back in the 1980s, in Queensland. The issues that the honourable member raises are serious. They go to the heart of the frustration of Indigenous Australians when they cannot own their own homes or businesses. They see very little future for themselves under the DOGIT system that operates in Queensland and under the current native title laws that operate in the Northern Territory. I am very aware of the situation on Mornington Island. I went there recently and was saddened to learn from the mayor of the situation the council is in. It comes down to the fact there has been inadequate bureaucracy supporting those councils. The Auditor General has found that they have in fact been dealing outside their financial capabilities. fact, the Queensland government is looking at what it will do with the council. The reality is that no council is going to succeed if it does not have adequate bureaucracy supporting it. This government now has legislation before the House which provides that CEOs of organisations will be held responsible and will no longer be able to move from one council or one Aboriginal corporation to another and get away with maladministration. The situation on Mornington Island is deplorable. We have already moved with the state government, and I applaud the Queensland Minister for Energy and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Policy, John Mickel, for his interest in trying to rectify the situation. But the fact is that children on Mornington Island do not go to school and the parents have said to me-as I am sure they have said to the honourable member for Kennedy-that they want the law to apply equally to them as it would to white children anywhere else. That is, if their children do not go to school, the state government should act to ensure that they get them to school so they have an education and a real future. There is an intervention program in place, but we have to ensure that Indigenous people have the right to run their own property, that businesses can operate openly in the market economy, that children are forced to go to school, that they get an education and that the deplorable level of violence and gambling to great excess, which is putting children at risk, is dealt with. That is a commitment that we have in working with the state governments. The summit that we have notified everyone of will be carried out shortly, and it will go a long way to addressing many of the concerns that the honourable member for Kennedy has raised today. Education",95
186,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My quesIn tion is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister inform the House of the steps the government is taking to uphold academic standards in Australian schools? Are there any alternative policies?",95
187,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Macquarie for his interest in this matbird's ter. The Howard government is determined to ensure that all students across Australia receive quality schooling and nationally consistent standards. That is why we are focusing on literacy and numeracy testing across Australia on statements of learning in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 and a certificate of education for year 12. That is why we have invested a record $33 billion in schooling-a $12 billion increase over the last funding period. I am asked about alternative policies. Just when you thought that Labor could not get any lazier on policy development, I can announce to the House that, after a five-year absence, Knowledge Nation is back. Remember the noodle nation? In reannouncing this policy over the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition said: I see no good reason why the best bits of my Knowledge Nation can't have new life breathed into them. While the Leader of the Opposition is reheating his instant noodles, we on this side of the House want to know which bits are the best bits. Which bits is he going to leave out? Is he going to leave out schools, the environment or tourism? While members opposite cringe at the memory of Knowledge Nation-the noodle nation-they were not so polite when it was first introduced. I recall the member for Hotham-always very polite-in the understatement of the year, saying, ‘I think we need to simplify it.' The member for Grayndler, in a confessional mode, said, ‘I know some of you were really disappointed with the Knowledge Nation package.' Disappointed? The member for Melbourne said, ‘The Knowledge Nation policy taken to the 2001 election was a prime example of what not to do next time.' But we had to hand it to Alan Ramsey from the Sydney Morning Herald to tell it as it is. He said: In one mad moment, with his incomprehensible nest sketch of 23 circles and 40 train lines, Barry Jones made Kim Beazley's Knowledge Nation an instant national joke … Why would Labor bring back a discredited policy? Because, unlike the Howard government, they refuse to do the hard yards in policy development. They do not come up with any new ideas to take Australia forward, and that is why they have brought back from the ashes a failed and discredited policy.",96
188,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",96
189,Mr HOWARD,FORMER SENATOR KEN WRIEDT," Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to extend an apology to a former member of the Senate and a former minister in the Whitlam government, Senator Ken Wiedt. Yesterday, I mistakenly referred to him as the ‘late' Senator Ken Wriedt. I apologise for that and I acknowledge his entitlement to invoke the Mark Twain defence. NA",96
190,The SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY BEHAVIOUR,"Earlier today the House suspended the Manager of Opposition Business for 24 hours for defying the chair. The circumstances were that the opposition manager moved a motion including unparliamentary terms that had been included in a motion on 25 May moved by the Leader of the House when I was not in the chair. As the official record shows, last week the House resolved that the motion put to the House was in order by negativing a motion of dissent from the Deputy Speaker's ruling to that effect. I also note that, when I resumed the chair on 25 May, the Leader of the House withdrew the offensive expressions unconditionally. This morning I requested, as Speaker, that the same unparliamentary expressions be withdrawn without reservation. The Manager of Opposition Business declined to do so. This constitutes defiance of the chair which, in the interests of orderly proceedings, cannot be tolerated. I would expect all occupants of the chair to act as I did this morning. In the interests of the way in which the House is perceived, I would request all members to ensure that the language they use in the House is characterised by good temper and moderation and that the directions given by the chair are complied with. I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate that parliamentary expressions should be withdrawn without reservation. NA Parliamentary Behaviour",96
191,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have a question to you, Mr Speaker, in relation to the statement you have just made. Do I understand, from your statement, that that is in effect a rebuke of the Leader of the House for the terminology that he used at the time in the chamber, a rebuke for moving the motion in the terms in which he did and a rebuke to the Deputy Speaker at the time for the way in which that matter was handled?",97
192,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I believe the statement that I have just given to the House covers all the points relevant to his question. I do not intend to add to my statement.,97
193,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"That is a bit of a problem because I think the honourable member for Lalor has effectively been held to a different standard in her suspension from this chamber today. It may be the case that, after your admonitions to the Leader of the House, he withdrew the terms that he used in describing one of our members on this side of the House, but that does not get over the problem of the particular resolution that was put and carried in this place. It would be a very unfortunate thing if the member for Lalor, our manager of business, was treated in a different manner than the gentleman opposite.",97
194,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the Leader of the Opposition. If I could just clarify again: the point the Manager of Opposition Business was named for was defying the chair. Parliamentary Behaviour,97
195,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, un- I just draw your attention to the fact that page 33 of the Hansard of last Thursday does still record that motion as being carried by this House: ‘That that snivelling grub over there be not further heard.' I draw your attention to page 294 of House of Representatives Practice, which makes it very clear that ‘a motion may not be brought forward which ... contains offensive or disorderly words'. The question to you, Mr Speaker, is: what action do you intend to take to ensure that that motion is rescinded and that that reflection on the entire dignity of this House does not remain as a permanent record of this parliament?",97
196,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I refer the member for Grayndler back to the statement. I have just that made and remind him that there was no refusal last week to withdraw any term, and the Votes and Proceedings record accordingly.",97
197,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Page 33 of Hansard records, in fact, that on a number of occasions, both prior to the Deputy Speaker putting the motion and indeed during that division, members on this side of the Houseincluding myself, the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Fraser and others-all made very clear the fact that we wanted that reference withdrawn. It was not done. In fact, the manager of government business compounded the original problem by withdrawing it under the terms: If I have offended grubs, I withdraw unconditionther ally. I note these were the exact words used by the member for Lalor this morning, for which she was suspended.",97
198,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Grayndler and I understand the point he is raising, but I refer him back to my statement, which, I believe, covers all the points that he has raised. Parliamentary Behaviour Parliament House: Airconditioning",98
199,Mr SECKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Reluctantly, Mr Speaker, I ask you two questions. Firstly, I hope I did not mishear what happened today, but early on in question time. I think the member for Bass said something along the lines of ‘Tell the truth' and was asked to withdraw that comment. Yet the member for Perth, in the seventh question by the opposition today, used the comment, ‘Why did the such-and-such member not tell the truth?' I just wondered why there might be a difference in treatment for that. I would ask you to check the Hansard on that. Secondly, on a completely different matter, I have noticed this chamber being quite warm and I wondered whether there is something about the Mr Ripoll-Can't stand the heat in the kitchen!",98
200,Mr SECKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Okay, have your fun. Mr Albanese-It's the National Party melting down!",98
201,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,Order! The member for Barker has the call.,98
202,Mr SECKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I say that because I think we could save a lot of energy in this House if we did not have the place so unnecessarily warm.,98
203,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Barker. On the second point, I will make furinquiries on the temperature and see what action can be taken. In response to the first point that the member for Barker raises, I refer him to page 499 of House of Representatives Practice. The words that I think are appropriate are: The determination as to whether words used in the House are offensive or disorderly rests with the Chair, and the Chair's judgment depends on the nature of the word and the context in which it is used. Parliamentary Behaviour",98
204,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Can I seek further clarification on the same topic, because in this House-and the member for Hunter will probably agree with me on this-people have often called out, ‘Tell the truth.' If that is disorderly, you are going to have to knock a lot of people out of this place.",98

223,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I refer to the earlier discussion relating to the motion that is currently on the books in Hansard and refer you to House of Representatives Practice, page 588, where it says: Although only the House itself can exercise control over the content of the Hansard reports, in practice this responsibility has devolved to the Speaker. Rulings of the Chair form the guidelines for what is to be deleted from the debates and what is to be incorporated. Further down it says: The Chair has a responsibility to ensure that no objectionable material is included in the debates. Mr Speaker, I put it to you that you have the power, as Speaker of the House, to order that the Hansard be corrected and that the offensive words be removed from the final form of Hansard-this is not the daily Hansard. the There is ample precedent for that. Indeed, there was an occasion where a constituent of mine was inadvertently named in question time and the Speaker subsequently allowed the deletion of the constituent's name from the permanent record of Hansard. So I would suggest to you that there is ample power contained in there. Now you can rule that those words are objectionable and that they be deleted from the final Hansard record.",99
224,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the member for Banks. Could I ask him which edition of the Practice he is quoting?,99
225,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"This is House of Representatives Practice, fourth edition.",99
226,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,There is a new edition.,99
227,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Yes, but it is the same principle. I am sorry I do not have the latest, but it does occur on that particular page. The principle is that you have the discretion to remove those offensive words from the subsequent Official Hansard. It has not been altered. I am happy to hand you the fourth edition.",99
228,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the member for Banks. I think the fifth edition has taken over. The member for Banks would be aware that it is not normal practice for the Speaker to have words deleted when they are integral to the debate that is in the Hansard.,100
229,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order in response to that: could I suggest therefore that the member might give you a list of some of the more famous quotes still in Hansard from the one-time Treasurer and Prime Minister Keating, because I can remember",100
230,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,The member for O'Connor will resume his seat. He will not debate the points of order. NA,100
231,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY BEHAVIOUR," Mr Speaker, I do not think your position on this is unreasonable. Therefore, other action needs to be taken. Accordingly, I move: That so much of the standing and sessional ders be suspended as would allow the Leader of the Opposition to move the following motion: This Parliament recognises the responsibility we have to the people we are elected to represent, to improve parliamentary standards through the consistent application and enforcement of standing orders and use of language which is appropriate for the National Parliament. This House reaffirms our support for standing order 89, concerning that “a Member must not use offensive words against . . . a Member liament”, standing order 90, that “all personal reflections on other Members shall be considered highly disorderly”, standing order 91b, concerning the withdrawal of “objectionable words”, and that House of Representatives Practice on page 294 makes it clear that “a motion may not be brought forward which . . . contains offensive or disorderly words”. This House therefore notes that the resolution moved by the Leader of the House on Thursday 25 May 2006, shown at page 33 of Hansard, that “that snivelling grub over there be not further heard” was not altered by the statement that “if I have offended grubs, I withdraw unconditionally”, was therefore subsequently put to the House and carried at page 34 of Hansard, and is an out of order resolution and therefore must be rescinded. A very substantial injustice has been done here. I do not put you at the centre of that injustice, Mr Speaker, but it is an injustice that has occurred nevertheless. What those injustices oblige you to do, or the course you have chosen to take, is effectively to have the chair treat one member of this chamber on the government side of the House in one form and the Manager of Opposition Business in another form. The Manager of Opposition Business was suspended from the service of this parliament today for doing exactly what was done and what was permitted to stand for a substantial period of time in this parliament by the Leader of the House, including a motion moved in identical terms or- and followed up by a refusal to withdraw an imputation against a member of the House in exactly identical terms. There is no difference between what the member for Lalor had to say today and what the Leader of the House had to say the other day on the dates that I mentioned here. The motion that was then moved by the Leader of the House was of course massively disorderly. When we go to House of Repreof Parsentatives Practice we see, as this motion indicates, a very clear statement that ‘a motion may not be brought forward which contains offensive or disorderly words'. ‘That that snivelling grub over there be not further heard' is quite clearly in absolute breach of that section of standing orders and ought to have been ruled out instantly by the Deputy Speaker at the time. As I said, I am discussing here the chair, not your personal behaviour, Mr Speaker. You were not there at the time these events took place. Nevertheless, you live with the consequences of the events which occurred. Quite clearly, the Deputy Speaker should have done two things on that occasion. The Deputy Speaker should have firstly ruled the motion which had been moved out of order and in clear breach of House of Representatives Practice. The second thing which should have occurred is that the Deputy Speaker on that occasion should have asked for, as was requested by those on this side of the House, an absolute withdrawal, an unconditional withdrawal, of the expression ‘grub' as it applied to a member of this side of this House. Neither of those things happened at the time. Subsequently, when you came back to the chair-some considerable number of pages of Hansard later-an unconditional withdrawal was sought and obtained. However, the record stands: that motion was carried by this chamber and it is a very difficult situation to correct. When that motion and the behaviour associated with it were tested by this side of the House, the experience of the Manager of Opposition Business was very different from the experience of the Leader of the House. In fact, she has been obliged to leave the chamber. I think that is an unfortunate thing. She was making a point. Quite clearly in the words that you have utilised in your explanation in this chamber, you have found the circumstances unacceptable, the position adopted by the Leader of the House unacceptable, the motion that he moved unacceptable and the chairing of the Deputy Speaker at that time unacceptable. That is the clear implication in all of the things that you have had to say in the remarks you have made. Unfortunately, what we have been left with from all of that are too substantial tices, one to the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Lalor. She is a respectable member of this place. She is a person of great substance in this chamber and a person who is listened to when she rises to her feet to make a point here. She now has to live with the opprobrium, which is welcomed more avidly by some than by others, of having been suspended from the service of this chamber. There are members who avidly seek that notoriety. She is not one of them. So she has now found herself in a situation where simply pursuing to a point of clarity what ought to have been normal behaviour in this place has caused her to be suspended from the service of this House. That is not good, Mr Speaker. That should simply not have happened and the matter should simply not conclude at the point at which we find ourselves right now, admirable though your subsequent rulings may have been and in accordance with standing orders as your subsequent insistence on particular behaviours might have been, requesting that these sorts of words ought to be withdrawn and these motions ought to be moved as the normal thing for a chair to have done. So, as I have said, I am not reflecting on you, your rulings or the chair, at least not on your handling of the chair. I am reflecting big time on the handling of the chair on that particular day, but that is a matter that was dealt with in argument in this place at that point of time. So how do we correct this? That is the position that we are now in. We have had the situation where the member for Lalor has been suspended from the service of the House. That motion has been passed and that is a very difficult thing in itself to rescind. We have a situation where the different treatment accorded, for whatever set of reasons, to the manager of government business injushas been permitted to stand. Somehow we have to right that and I cannot think of any way of righting that other than by this motion which I am proposing to the chamber and for which I have sought a suspension of standing orders in order to do that. The relevant part of this motion is the last part of it. It says this: This House therefore notes that the resolution moved by themanager of government business... on Thursday 25 May 2006, shown at page 33 of Hansard, that “that snivelling grub over there be not further heard” was not altered by the statement that “if I have offended grubs, I withdraw unconditionally”, was therefore subsequently put to the House and carried at page 34 of Hansard, and is an out of order resolution and therefore must be rescinded. Should a suspension motion be carried, then all that would happen would be that this motion that I propose would then be debated. Should that motion then be passed, I think it would be incumbent upon the manager of government business to give notice that a motion rescinding that particular motion should be moved. It is appropriate that the manager of government business, not those on this side of the House, move that motion. But if the House were to accept the motion that I have put forward, that would be a very clear indication to the manager of government business that we expect such a motion to be moved. So, Mr Speaker, in order to clear this up, in order to take it out as effectively as we can-and you cannot alter Hansard-in order to secure a situation where a rescission motion produces the sort of outcome that you have effectively said ought to be there in the way in which you have ruled on this, I would hope that, firstly, the parliament would agree to this suspension and then agree to the motion and that subsequently the manager of government business would move the appropriate rescission.",100
232,The SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY BEHAVIOUR,Is the motion seconded? Mr Albanese-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,102
233,Mr ABBOTT,PARLIAMENTARY BEHAVIOUR,"I certainly do not intend to detain the House for long on this particular business. But I do say in response to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition that there were two false premises on which his remarks were based. The first false premise is that there has been a lack of evenhandedness in the way this House has been conducted. The second false premise is that an improper motion was carried by this House last Thursday. Let me deal first with the accusation of the Leader of the Opposition that there has been a lack of even-handedness. Mr Speaker, as you have made it clear repeatedly today, and most recently in your formal statement from the chair, the member for Lalor was named by you not for any particular phraseology that she used and not for any particular motion that she put to the House but because she defied the chair. As you quite rightly said, defiance of the chair must be dealt with. It always has been and it always will be. Mr Speaker, you have dealt with defiance of the chair even-handedly whenever it has occurred, whether it be by members of the opposition or whether it be by members of the government. So let me make it absolutely crystal clear: the member for Lalor was named because she defied the chair. No such defiance of the chair took place last Thursday. The second point I wish to make is that there was no improper motion carried by the House the other day. On no fewer than three separate occasions the Deputy Speaker stated the question before the House in these terms: ‘That the member be no longer heard.' That was the question that was put to the House and that was the question that was voted upon. Mr Ripoll-He's making it up.",102
234,The SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY BEHAVIOUR,The member for Oxley is on very thin ice.,103
235,Mr ABBOTT,PARLIAMENTARY BEHAVIOUR,"I am not making it up. On page 33 of the Hansard the Deputy Speaker said: For the benefit of members, the question before the House is ‘That the member be no longer heard'. On page 34 the Deputy Speaker said: The motion is ‘That the member be no longer heard.' And again on page 34: I am putting the motion. The motion is ‘That the member be no longer heard'. On three separate occasionsMs Plibersek-That's not what you said.",103

243,Mr KERR,PARLIAMENTARY BEHAVIOUR,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. ‘Mendacious' is simply another way of saying ‘lies', and it should be withdrawn. It is entirely offensive.",103
244,The SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY BEHAVIOUR,The member for Denison will resume his seat. I think the word ‘mendacious' is not unparliamentary. It may be undesirable but I do not believe it is unparliamentary. It has been used before.,103

248,Mr ABBOTT,PARLIAMENTARY BEHAVIOUR,Let me go back to the events of last Thursday because they have plainly excited members opposite. It would have been better if the Deputy Speaker had sought a rephrasing of the motion; there is no doubt about that. Mr Hatton interjecting,103
249,The SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY BEHAVIOUR,Order! The member for Blaxland!,103
250,Mr ABBOTT,PARLIAMENTARY BEHAVIOUR,"It would have been better if I had not moved the motion in the terms that I originally did. But, Mr Speaker, it would also have been better if the member for Wills had not, in my opinion, abused the forms of the House by making a speech in the guise of a motion. It would have been better if the Leader of the Opposition had not sicked the member for Wills on this baseless vendetta against an honourable man, the member for Gwydir. It would have been better if the member for Wills had accepted the repeated public statements of the member for Gwydir on this issue. So there are many things that could have been done differently. Of course things would have been better if things had happened differently, but the fact of the matter is that both of the premises on which the Leader of the Opposition based his remarks are false. Mr Speaker, you have conducted the House with an exemplary level of even-handedness and no improper motion was put and carried by this House. All of us are in favour of higher parliamentary standards. The kind of barracking that we are currently hearing from members opposite indicates, shall I say, some want of good faith in the question that has been moved. But the truth is that, in our better moments as our best selves, all of us would like this be better conducted. Sometimes in the heat of the moment and sometimes in pursuit of political argument all of us go too far. I am certainly prepared to accept that, from time to time, I do, but there would not be a member of either front-bench who has not sometimes done more and said more than should have been said. Mr Speaker, I certainly think that, as far as I am concerned, amends were made as best I could, unprompted and unadmonished by you, by my complete withdrawal subsequent to the votes on Thursday.",103
251,Mr ALBANESE,PARLIAMENTARY BEHAVIOUR,"Grayndler) (3.43 pm)We have just heard the confession but without the contrition. The Leader of the House is not just a member of the front-bench; he has a particular role in this House in terms promoting parliamentary standards. Indeed, the Leader of the House said on 19 March 2002: I am very proud to serve in this government-a government which has upheld the highest parliashould mentary standards, a government which supports the great institutions of this country. And on a number of other occasions the manager of government business, the Leader of the House, has stood in this place and in the media and spoken about the need for us to be kinder and gentler to each other and has spoken to us about the need to lift up the liamentary standards in this place. But this motion goes beyond the interests of the Leader of the House or the interests of any of us. It goes to the dignity of this parliament itself as an institution. The fact is that page 33 of the Hansard of Thursday, 25 May 2006 records in perpetuity that this House carried a motion, ‘That the snivelling grub over there be not further heard.' Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Grayndler is making an assertion which is simply untrue. Three times, the question was stated from the place to chair and it was not as he said.",104
252,The SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY BEHAVIOUR,This is a debate on this particular issue and both sides have the opportunity to state their case.,104
253,Mr ALBANESE,PARLIAMENTARY BEHAVIOUR,"That is what Hansard records in black and white. It also records the fact that, on a number of occasions, the Leader of the House was asked to withdraw and, to be perfectly accurate, the Leader of the House did withdraw. He withdrew on page 39-six pages of Hansard later, an hour later, after totally unnecessary divisions and conflict in this House. Why should this suspension be carried? It should be carried because the dignity of this House will be damaged if it is not. If that motion remains in the book then standing orders 89, 90 and 91(b), of which were breached, will be in question. This motion deliberately does not condemn the Leader of the House and it takes no offence against any individual; it is aimed at the collective dignity of this House. What have occurred last Thursday is that the Leader of the House should have stood up immediately and said, ‘You're right.' He should have used the words, ‘I was wrong.' That did not occur last Thursday, it did not occur yesterday and it did not occur this morning. It should happen right now. But we have not heard that today. AAP story No. par3015, reporting on a press conference, says: Mr Abbott today conceded Mr Lindsay could have handled last Thursday's debate better. The poor bloke was doing his best“Strictly speaking, the chair probably should have Lawrence, C.M. required me to rephrase the motion,” Mr Abbot told AAP. Why doesn't the Leader of the House know that it was within his power to do that? The Leader of the House should accept this suspension-should vote for this motion-and then give seven days notice, in accordance with standing order 220, that the motion be rescinded. Unless that occurs, the motion stays. My colleague the member for Lalor took the action she took this morning to draw attention to that. What we have seen is the difference in standards between the member for Lalor, who has standards, and the Leader of the House, who simply does not. He will not accept responsibility for his actions and he always goes a yard too far. He should vote for this suspension and get rid of this stain on the parliament. Question put: That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to. The House divided. [3.53 pm] (The Speaker-Hon. David Hawker) Ayes………… Noes………… 80 Majority……… NA Adams, D.G.H. Albanese, A.N. Andren, P.J.

My office prepared an 11,200-word policy document on avian influenza in September last year. This policy document was drawn upon in extracts, which were then produced by the Labor Herald. Of the 11,200 words, there was a lack of citations in a total of seven paragraphs-paragraphs of an entirely descriptive nature referring to the scientific definidown tion of the H5N1 virus, its historical impact on humans as well as the history of earlier flu pandemics. My staff have assured me that this was an inadvertent error, given that the document elsewhere extensively cites the work of a range of international and domestic health agencies.

The only thing that has happened is that the friends and relatives are now having a dispute over what should be in the formal content of the funeral notice. But let us make no bones about it: this party is no more. Despite all the hollering and hooting from all those up there in cocky corner, there has been a death in the Australian political family: ‘RIP Australian Country Party. Born 22 January 1920. Died 29 May 2006. Aged 86 years. Sadly missed by Mark and the kids.' This is what has happened to the once great Australian Country Party. The party of Black Jack MCEwen is reduced to what we have seen today-this pathetic, squabbling, comatose cadaver, twitching quietly in the corner before it finally shuffles off its mortal coil. The only one with any dispute about this is, of course, the Deputy Prime Minister himself. The Deputy Prime Minister reminds me so much of that bloke in Monty Python who says, ‘But I'm not dead yet!'

And who would have thought that Julian MCGauran would be a market leader in anything? That leaves us with the Deputy Prime Minister himself protesting to the parliament at large, to the country at large and to his party at large that this is a mere flesh wound. In fact, this is a dead parrot. This parrot is completely dead. This party is a dead parrot. But today it was like a voice channelling from the past. In answer to a question from the Leader of the Opposition, what was the initial response from the Deputy Prime Minister? ‘Don't you worry about that.' I hear the voice of distant years. It was Joh BjelkePetersen down the time tunnel of politics and into the House of Representatives-a place to which he wished to come once, did he not?-wreaking parallel havoc on this mob opposite. Well, the ghost of Joh is back in a different form, channelling through the Deputy Prime Minister today-‘Don't you worry about that.' I have to say, though, Deputy Prime Minister, most of your colleagues are very much worried about that. Peter Beattie got it right: Joh Bjelke-Petersen today would be rolling in his grave at the thought of the once great, proud Australian Country Party turning into what we have seen today-a subset of a minor branch of something now called the New Liberals in Queensland.

268,Mr RUDD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He did not follow the Billy Hughes dictum; he actually joined the Country Party. But that was back in the days when I grew up on a farm in rural Queensland and when the Country Party stood for something. That was when the Country Party stood for standing up for the country against the city based Liberals. They stood up for rural Australia in those days. This was the party of Black Jack MCEwen. My father always told me as a kid that, at the end of the day, you could depend on the Country Party to go out there and argue your case. That was back in the sixties. That was before they sided with the city based Liberals-to do what? Sell off Telstra. They sided with the city based Liberals to simply become a subset of city based Liberal politics and philosophy right across the board. None of the spirit of Black Jack MCEwen is alive in this mob today. None of the spirit of even Doug Anthony is alive in this mob today. That is why Doug has basically said that the show is over as well. But the rot really set in in the eyes of all rural and regional Australia when the Country Party, later called the National Party, said, ‘We're going to roll over on Telstra.' Can you imagine any previous leader of the National Party or the Country Party ever saying to his constituency out there, right across this great, vast country of ours, that we are going to support the privatisation of Telstra, Telecom or the Postmaster General? Could you ever believe that any previous National Party leader would simply roll over and say, ‘Tickle my tummy'? That is exactly what happened-‘Tickle my tummy.' When you unpack it all and look at how many times the Nats have folded to the Libs, the pattern of behaviour is simply consistent. There is a fundamental schism at work here. When you stack it up on a piece of paper, the National Party is supposed to stand for opposing unbridled free market principles as it impacts on rural working families. If you unpack it all, that is what they are supposed to stand for. Yet they have somehow teamed up with this mob-Peter Costello's Liberal Party or the Liberal Party which Peter Costello would like to have-a party whose philosophy is this: there shall be no break on the market, there shall be no intervention on the market, and when it comes to any part of the country, city or country, let the principles of the market rule. There is such a deep philosophical chasm between what the Country Party used to stand for and what the Liberal Party still stands for. But what has the Country Party, now the National Party, done instead? Instead of arguments of political principle and basic principle, it has simply hauled up the white flag and said, ‘Over to you, Pete.'",107

Could you imagine, by the way, Bob Katter going back into the National Party as the federal member for Kennedy",108
271,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Griffith will refer to members by their seat or their title.,108
272,Mr RUDD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"and saying he was running on a platform of ‘Bob Katter, New Liberal candidate for Kennedy'? Can you just imagine the impact across rural Australia? We are having this debate because the National Party itself as an institution is collapsing before our eyes and the political authority of the Deputy Prime Minister, as a consequence, is collapsing before our eyes. He got some advice today from Senator Boswell in the Senate. Senator Boswell's advice was this: ‘Mark, resign.' That was the advice. If you have look at the trade figures over which the Minister for Trade has presided in his period since the year 2000, the trade figures of themselves suggest he do nothing else other than resign. Since he has been trade minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, we have registered 49 consecutive monthly trade deficits, contributing to a $20 billion annual trade deficit, contributing to a $55 billion current account deficit and contributing to a record half trillion dollar foreign debt. And this trade minister thinks there is no case to answer. Dig down into the detail of what our Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister has presided over. This is where, colleagues, it gets interesting-comparing the basic export data during this minister's custodianship of the trade portfolio and those who have preceded him. Let us look at total exports. Between 1983 and 1996 total exports from Australia grew annually on average by 8.1 per cent. That was our period in government. In the first four years after we lost government and the other mob took over-that is, between 1996 and 2000-that slowed to four per cent annual growth. Guess what has happened since 2000. Since this trade minister has occupied the portfolio, which is now six years, growth in exports is now just over 1.6 per cent per annum. Let me frame it for you again: 8.1 per cent per annum under us, four per cent per annum under his predecessors and now 1.6 per cent per annum during his six years in the job. When you go through the individual parts of the export profile of this country the is just as disastrous. Elaborately transformed manufactures achieved 12.9 per cent annual average growth under us and 5.3 per cent growth between 1996 and 2000. But since the year 2000 elaborately transformed manufactures exports have slowed further to only 3.6 per cent per annum. Go to rural exports. You would think that in this area the Deputy Prime Minister would excel. Average annual export growth from 1983 to 1996 was 4.8 per cent, slowing to 1.9 per cent between 1996 and 2000. But guess what has happened since 2000. They have actually gone south. They have gone into negative, recording an average annual decline in growth of 2.4 per cent per annum. Let us go on to minerals and metals exports, and remember that this government has had the happy happenstance of being in office when we have had record terms of trade, for which they can claim no creditthat is just a function of the international market. Between 1983 and 1996 minerals and metals exports had an average annual growth of 6.5 per cent per annum, slowing to 3.6 per cent per annum in 1996-2000. But since 2000 and this minister's six years at the table, it has gone down to 1.3 per cent annual growth. Again, it is a collapse. You see it across each category of exports. Let us go finally to services. This is the great long-term hope of the Australian economy: how do we boost services exports? Services exports when we were in office between 1983 and 1996 grew by nine per cent per year. Between 1996-2000, before this minister took over, they grew by just two per cent per year. In the six years since this minister has taken over, they have declined at an average rate of 0.3 per cent per year. Across the categories-not just exports as a whole but across rural exports, mining exports, elaborately transformed manufactures data and across services exports-the pattern is the same: robust export growth under us, where a government believed it had a job to do in encouraging exports by concrete things in industry policy and elsewhere, and decline under a government which has now taken its hands off the policy levers altogether, resulting in a performance against all categories of exports that is sad and sorry indeed. This minister says that his other great policy achievement, before he exits the portfolio and takes Bos's suggestion in the Senate, is the free trade agreement with the United States. Let us have a quick look at how that one has gone. In the first 12 months of the operation of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement exports to the US fell by $280 million in year average terms while imports from the United States-what?-grew by close to $870 million in year average terms, with the net result that Australia's trade deficit with United States increased by $1.1 billion or 11 per cent to a total of $12 billion. This is the US free trade agreement. How many times have we heard this Minister for Trade, the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Prime Minister stand at that dispatch box and say, ‘This is the greatest thing since sliced bread'? Yet in the first year that the numbers flow through, Australian exports to the US are down, imports from United States are up and going through the roof, the result being that our bilateral trade deficit got worse. This is the USFTA, where here we have a National Party Minister for Trade, a National Party Deputy Prime Minister, who could not even get our American cousins to let in one extra bit of sugar. Sugar was completely off the table. How can you be a self respecting National Party Minister for Trade and front up to the Americans and say, ‘Okay, roll over, tickle my tummy, there will be no sugar additionally exported to the United States.' I have to say on that one as well that it is pretty pathetic. The trade minister's other boast a year or two into his occupancy of this portfolio was particularly interesting. It was that the trade minister was going to do what, Mark? What were you going to do for the number of exporters in Australia?",108
273,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Griffith will address his remarks through the chair.,110
274,Mr RUDD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Was the Deputy Prime Minister going to increase the number of exporters by 25 per cent. No. By 50 per cent? No. Could it have been by 75 per cent? No. The Deputy Prime Minister said, I think it was four years ago, that he was going to double the number of exporting firms in Australia. How has that one gone since then? How is it going? According to the ABS data in 2004, there were 43,452 exporting firms. In 2005 that went down to 40,797 exporting firms. They are going south rather than north, according to the ABS data on that year on year. I would be interested to see the rest of strategy that you propose to unfold. Whether it is in export numbers across rural, mining or services manufacturing, whether it is your performance on the whole question of the USFTA and what that has delivered additionally to Australian exporters or whether it is in boosting the numbers of exporting firms, the pattern is the same. has Deputy Prime Minister, you should not just consider leaving the portfolio. The national interest demands right now, on the back of the AWB and on the back of everything else, that you leave politics altogether. You stand condemned.",110
275,Mr VAILE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You still have a bit of time left, mate. In your dreams-the Milky Bar kid is dreaming again. This discussion on a matter of public importance is about political instability and export performance. Let us have a look at the political instability that exists in the Labor Party ranks. We have the Leader of the Opposition who only has an approval rating of 25 per cent and who is only one caucus meeting away from sitting back on the backbench. The member for Griffith-and this is why he is running this MPI; the member for Griffith is going to run out and have a Milky Bar now-is on 27 per cent. He wants to try to get past the member for Lalor, the Manager of Opposition Business, who is on 31 per cent. She has not helped herself today as she has been put out of the House for 24 hours. That is the opposition. That is the sort of political stability they are putting forward. Since we have been in government, look at the form on the front bench in the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. When we won office in 1996 we had Mr Beazley, then we had Mr Crean, then we had Mr Lathamwe can all read about Mr Latham's escapades-and now we have Mr Beazley back again. When we look at the research about Mr Beazley, we see the member for Lalor breathing down the neck of the member for Brand, we have the member for Griffith breathing down the neck of the member for Brand and we have the incoming member for Maribyrnong who is going to breathe down the neck of the lot of them. So, if you want to have a look at some political instability, you need go no further than the Australian Labor Party. We all remember the former Leader of the Opposition, the then member for Werriwa, when he described the sickness that infects every level of the parliamentary Labor Party. He has written about it in his book and he has put it out there for all to read. It is a scription of political instability and it exists from top to bottom in the Australian Labor Party. He pointed out that more than 30 of the Labor MPs and senators in this parliament think of themselves as factional powerbrokers. Their only interest is in securing factional advantage, not in making policies that would benefit the Australian people. That is his view, not my view; I am just repeating it. He has written that about all of the front bench and all of those involved in the recent warfare that has taken place in Victoria that has seen two frontbenchers lose their preselection. The member for Hotham only just, by the skin of his teeth, salvaged his. The Labor Party ought to be the last group of people in this place to talk about political instability. The rest of this discussion is about export performance. The member for Griffith can come in, spin his wheels and talk about all sorts of statistics and percentages, but the reality is that, in 1996, the value of Australia's exports was $99 billion. In 2005, their value was $177.5 billion. When you reconcile those figures with the percentages and statistics that the member for Griffith was spinning, if you have a look at today's statistics, there is an improvement in the balance of trade. Our exports rose in the month of April by five per cent or increased by $799 million to $16.9 billion in April this year. This was the highest April level on record. This was the second highest level of monthly exports on record. So we are continuing to set higher standards in the value of our exports going out of Australia. What did that consist of? It consisted of an increase in resource exports, yes. On the one hand, the Labor Party like to slag off at the government about taking the benefits of the resource boom, yet, on the other hand, they ask us to protect Australia against the comdepetitive advantages that other countries have, such as cheaper labour markets. But one of the competitive advantages that Australia has is that we are well endowed with resources and energy and we have a perfect right to take advantage of them when there is an upswing or boom in the resources cycle across the world. Of course we are going to factor that into our figures. Of course we are going to work hard to ensure that we capitalise on that for the benefit of the entire nation. The Labor Party like to rail against what they see happening to manufactured exports. In the month of April, manufacturing exports rose by three per cent to $3.4 billion. We have continued to see an increase in the growth of exports of fully built-up motor cars and automotive parts that have taken place under the programs that this government has put in place since the late 1990s to help restructure the automotive manufacturing industry in this country and launch them into export markets across the world and into opening up markets. The classic example of that is Toyota. Toyota Australia is one of the best exporting components of the Toyota network into the Middle East particularly. That cannot be ignored. The growth in the volume of exports of Toyota product out of Australia, as with all automotive products out of Australia during recent years, took place after this government put in an industry policy. The member for Griffith was bragging about the industry policy implementation of the Australian Labor Party and what they did when they were in office. This is an industry policy that this government put in place that has helped put the automotive manufacturing sector where it is. We put that in place in the late 1990s. I spoke about the political instability exists in the current Australian Labor Party in this place. Let us cast our minds back to the economic instability that they wreaked on this nation when they were in office for 13 years that saw massive unemployment of 10.9 per cent. These are undeniable statistics. Under Labor, unemployment peaked at 10.9 per cent in 1992. In contrast, the coalition has reduced unemployment to 5.1 per cent. That is a statistic that the Labor Party could only dream about in their term in office. That is about the lowest level of unemployment in 30 years. Going to management of the budget, we all recall the last budget that the then Labor government brought down. When we came to office in 1995-96 there was a $10.3 billion budget deficit compared to a surplus of $10.8 billion that we are forecasting in 2006-07. We have continued to deliver budget surpluses to help strengthen the Australian economy, to lift our international credit rating and to assist Australian companies that borrow offshore to compete internationally. We have improved the economy in Australia. For 10 years we have been reminding the Labor Party and the people of Australia about the debt that was left by the Labor government when they left office in 1996-a debt of $96 billion that the taxpayers of Australia have had to pay off over that period. The Labor Party love to rabbit on about the national debt that the private sector owes. The debt that is the most important to Australian taxpayers is the public sector debt that they have to service, and they have been servicing it for years as a result of mismanagement by the Australian Labor Party. We have eliminated that debt. We have retired that debt to the point that we are now saving roughly $8 billion a year in interest that we were paying to service that debt. Of course, one of the great legacies that that the Labor Party left this country was how they wrecked small business and farming businesses with their high interest rate policy. They believed that the economy was heating up too much, so the then Treasurer and later Prime Minister Keating decided he would slow it down. He slowed it down all right-he slowed it down with a sledgehammer. He said, ‘I've got the levers in control of this.' He was controlling interest rates at the time and saw them peak at 17 per cent-interest rates that are undreamt of today. There is a generation of Australians now who cannot recall how personally damaging those interest rates were during the period of the Labor government. It is our responsibility to continue to remind them. We should not just be talking about the political instability that exists in the Labor Party today; we should be talking about the economic instability that was their legacy for this nation of Australia when we came into office in 1996. Importantly, we have worked very hard since then to strengthen the Australian economy, to improve the circumstances, to introduce reforms and reform the taxation system. As you would well remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, we removed $3.5 billion worth of taxes off the back of Australia's exports. Just imagine if they were still trying to carry that burden and compete in the international marketplace. If I can just reiterate: along with those tistics, which were the legacy of the Australian Labor Party when we came into office in 1996, their legacy was $99 billion worth of trade exports and today we have $177 billion worth of exports. Of the 1.7 million jobs that have been created in the Australian economy since 1996, about 320,000 of those have been generated through our strong export performance. So our exporting industries are also contributing to jobs growth in this country. The Labor Party in office could have only dreamt about that level of jobs growth-the creation of 1.7 million new jobs-in the Australian economy. Over that period we have strengthened the domestic economic circumstances to give strength to Australia's exporters to compete in global markets. We have not been lazy on trade policy by putting all our eggs in one basket and just thinking about the multilateral system. We have continued to put our energy into improving the circumstances in the multilateral system and we are on the verge of doing that at the moment, I believe. We also embarked, as the member for Griffith indicated, on a series of bilateral trade negotiations, which not only opened up new opportunities but also consolidated our position. He referred to the US free trade agreement. That is fine because I will respond to his comments about the US free trade agreement. There are two key statistics that resulted in those figures for last year, and they had nothing to do with the negotiated agreement we put in place at the beginning of 2005. One key point was the shift in exports of beef from the United States to Japan. We dominate the Japanese imports of beef today. Almost 100,000 tonnes of beef went out of the American market into the Japanese market because it was a higher value market. That is what business does. It is not the responsibility of the government; it stais the responsibility of business to look for the best market across the world. There was a big drop in exports of oil from Australia to Hawaii that are part of those statistics. Make no mistake: our businesses, particularly our service providers getting into the US market and being treated the same as American companies in that market, getting access to the massive government procurement programs in the United States, will continue over time to deliver benefits-as will our negotiated outcomes with Singapore and Thailand, those that we are working on with the other ASEAN countries and indeed China. Just remember that there are two aspects to this policy. One is consolidation in our key markets and opening up new opportunities in those key markets. But there is also the effect that bilateral negotiations have on energising the multilateral system. Competitive liberalisation has been needed to drive and create a stronger focus to deliver an ambitious outcome in the multilateral system, something that I know the Australian Labor Party support. They supported the Uruguay Round of negotiations. Both sides of politics agreed on that. We have experienced strong economic circumstances in Australia, recognised globally, that have given us a strong exchange rate-an exchange rate that has been well above the 72c range for quite some time. I am not using that as an excuse, but we do know that that makes it a little bit more difficult for exporters and more attractive for importers. But that is the result of a strong economy and the view of the world about the Australian economy that has been created by this government's economic management over the last 10 years. In responding to this matter of public importance raised by the member for Griffith, talking about political instability, I ask rybody to look at the political instability exists in the ranks of the alternative government of Australia, today and into the future-because it is going to keep on going; they are going to keep on recycling leaders, unless the member for Griffith can get his polling up a little bit higher. He may get a guernsey yet, but he has to get past the member for Lalor first. And that is what this is all about. That is the challenge for the member for Griffith. If I can have the last word on export performance: in 1996, $99 billion by the Australian Labor Party; in 2005, $177 billion by the coalition government.",110
276,Mr RIPOLL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have to concur with the member for Griffith when he started his contribution to the debate in a very sombre tone, for what we are seeing is a funeral procession. It is the end. It is the death of the National Party. As they leave this chamber they should mark the days off on the wall, those last few days that they actually have in existence when they can call themselves the National Party. Whether it is days, weeks, months or years, their end has already been struck. There are two big issues around right now, amongst the many important political issues affecting Australia's national reputation-our reputation as an exporter, our credibility and the sort of impact it has on our national performance. One of those is our trade deficit: the way we trade, the problems we have had-our trade deficit is literally the worse in history-and all the associated problems. The other of course is the deficit in the National Party itself. This is also the worse on record, and one that is continuing to slide. We do not need to look very far to see the evidence of either: our trade performance, our trade figures; or the deficit within the National Party. The big question, the queseve- tion that is on everyone's lips, including that those of the National Party members and probably a few of the Liberal Party members, is: to merge or not to merge? What should they do? This is going to be a big question for them. I do not think they actually know the answer. Big questions; no real answers-to merge or not to merge. The other big question is: what are they going to call themselves? What new name will they go by? They are going to play around with a few names-the Old Nationals, the New Liberals, the whatever you want to call them. But I might suggest at least one name to them. We should call them the Libirrationals. That is exactly what they are. These guys have no sense of which direction they are actually walking in. If you have ever seen footage of somebody trying to herd cats, you can imagine what it is like in the party room for the National Party on this issue. I think it is an apt name that we can start using right away. I encourage people to refer to them not as The Nationals in Queensland anymore but as the Libirrationals, because it perfectly reflects the collective, confused state of mind of the Queensland Liberals and the Queensland Nationals. Under this new name they will be well regarded. For those of you who are not as familiar with Queensland politics and the particular nuances as I and the member for Griffith, the Libirrationals are supposed to be looking after country people. That is what they were set up to do. That is supposed to be their charter: country people, people living in the bush, regional Queensland and regional Australia. That is supposed to be what they do. But if you actually look at their record, who looks after people in the bush? It is the Labor Party. As is often said in this place, the best friend the people in the bush have ever had is the Labor Party. It is the Labor Party that looks after the interests of the bush. It is the Labor Party that stood up to this government, and this National Party in here, on the full sale of Telstra. That is something they have no answer for. We heard a moment ago from the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party-soon to be the Libirrationals-on a whole range of issues, defending his party and a whole heap of things. But he would not mention the ‘T' word: Telstra. He will not mention it because he is ashamed. He has disgraced himself, disgraced his own party, because he did not stand up to his Liberal Party masters on the issue of Telstra. There are many big issues for country people, people in the bush, but you would have to say that one of the biggest for them in recent times has been telecommunications-the full sale of Telstra. There may be confusion in the minds of the National Party, but there is certainly no confusion in the minds of people who live in the bush. They know that, if they are going to prosper, if they are going to be productive, if they are going to be able to survive out in the bush, in tougher and tougher environments, then they will need world-class telecommunications. They simply will not get that from this government, and they certainly will not get it from their so-called friends, the National Party. What we see in this place time after time is The Nationals capitulating to their Liberal masters, their political masters who stand over them. For too long the National Party have put the Liberal Party first and their stituents in the bush last. They have no clear answer on any of the issues that affect the bush. They have no clear ambition on any big issues in the bush. They just have clear ambitions for themselves, clear ambitions like those of the Deputy Prime Minister, who knows that the end of the National Party coalition spells the end of his deputy prime ministership. He knows that, were he to have to compete for his office and title against every other member in the Liberal Party, he might not succeed. That is the reality. They are in here debating all sorts of issues-protecting themselves, protecting their jobs, protecting their titles, protecting the benefits they enjoy from office. But I have not heard one of them yet-and we still have one more opportunity, from the member for CaseyMr Bevis-He's a Liberal!",114
277,Mr RIPOLL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He is a Liberal; that is right, because they cannot get the National Party to come in and defend themselves. There is one opportunity left in this sitting period for at least a Liberal member to come in here and defend the National Party. But I have not heard one defence yet-I have not heard one argument yet-from any of them about protecting people in the bush. They will talk about protecting themselves. They will talk about protecting a whole range of things. But they will not talk about protecting people in the bush. I would have loved to have sat here in the chamber and heard the Deputy Prime Minister talk about what he is going to do for people in the bush, talk about the future of telecommunications and talk about what the important issues are-but you will not hear those. I want to draw a couple of analogies, because there are a couple of clear ones, between the state of the National Party and the Liberal Party in Queensland and the state of our trade performance and our overall perconformance. Both clearly come under the control of the government and the Prime Minister. He actually controls what the National Party do. Not only does he control his own party; he controls what the National Party do. He will not put up with-not for one minute, not for one second-or entertain the thought that the Queensland Nationals or Liberals could actually determine their own futures. No, he will not have that, because the Prime Minister controls the levers of power. He will be telling them what to do, just as he tells them what to do on the big issues, just as he told them what to do on Telstra. They pretended for a little while there that they were all so concerned about Telstra. They were going to cut some special deals, and they were going to do all these things. But, if you boil all that away, what do you have left in the pot? Just a whole heap of bones. There is not much left, nothing for country people and nothing on the big issues. So, if you want to draw any analogies about our trade performance and how poorly we are doing, just turn to the Prime Minister and have a look at how he is running this government. Have a look at how he is riding roughshod over the National Party. Also, while the Prime Minister is telling them what to do, he does not exactly step in, help them out and give them a bit of a hand up. They need a leg up, because these guys are suffering. Anybody who comes from Queensland or who reads the national media will understand that these guys are in a whole heap of pain, a whole heap of hurt, because they really do not know where they are going. They are like a bunch of old Brown's cows, milling around the bottom paddock. The farmer has been away for years. They are just feeding on whatever is left. If a drought comes along, they are in a lot of trouble. If you have seen Queensland lately, you know what I am talking about. So all that you see in here-the feigned indignation, the attacks on us and everything else that you see and hear in here-is not about the future of the country. It is not about the future of where we are going. It is not about the future of the bush. It is not about the future of Telstra. All the frenetic activity you see is about saving their own hides. It is about saving their own skins. But the reality is that it is not going to matter what they do; they are already dead. I think the point that the member for Griffith led on is that they are already dead. They are the proverbial dead parrot: ‘He's not dead; he's just having a rest.' It is a long rest. It is going to be a long sleep. They are going to fall off the perch at any moment. They are dangling upside down. But we all know that they are already dead. Funnily enough, they do not know they are dead, but their constituents do. Their constituents already know they are dead, and they will not be voting for dead parties or dead members. Doug Anthony can spell it out and say: ‘Look, guys, I don't want to make too much of an issue, but I think you actually might have a point here in Queensland. You guys are dead; you're finished. Do something now, get on with the job; otherwise you're all gone.' The national president of the National Party had to be sacked yesterday because he actually told it how it was. That is what happens to you in the National Party if you speak out. But my favourite comment of all-and I have to hand this one to the member for Brisbane-was from the member for Brisbane. He said, ‘Who would have ever thought that Julian MCGauran would have been ahead of the game?' Poor old Julian. No-one in their wildest dreams could have ever thought that Mr Martin Ferguson-Even the member for Dickson thought that was funny!",115
278,Mr RIPOLL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And I will take the laughing interjection from the member for Dickson on his views. Just like the long drought we are having in Queensland, we are not just having a drought on the land; we are having a drought in the National Party caucus room as well. It has been a long time between drinks for them, so much so that they are calling for last drinks-farewell, adios, sayonara, arrivederci, adieu, good night and good luck. I am not quite finished, though. Mind you, the National Party is, but I am not quite finished. This ship of rats has just started sinking. A few of them-the well heeled, the fatter rats, the fatter Nationalscan smell the rising damp. They know what is happening to the ship. It is sinking, and they are starting to run like the rats they (Time expired)",116
279,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is yet another MPI from the opposition, yet another substance-free performance, almost an hour of debate at the pinnacle of the parliamentary day, following question time, when you would expect the opposition to be putting forward detailed policy positions, putting forward their alternative view for Australia. But instead what you get is this gaggle opposite-the member for Griffith moving a motion about alleged political instability and about Australia's export performance. The member for Griffith might have many things. The member for Griffith is obviously very hard working. He is obviously very ambitious. We know, as the Deputy Prime Minister said, that the member for Griffith is perpetual leadership parade. But one thing the member for Griffith does not have-and his colleagues would attest to this-is a sense of irony. He has absolutely no sense of irony, to put in an MPI on export performance on the day Australia's exports rose yet again and to talk about political instability the time when those on the opposition front bench are in perpetual political instability and when he is in a parade with the member for Lalor, who was suspended from this House this morning, trying to become the alternative opposition leader. As the Deputy Prime Minister said, the member for Griffith needs to lift his polling a bit. He is on 27 cent. The member for Lalor is apparently on 31. The current Leader of the Opposition comes third, which has to be a record in Australian politics. But, more than that, I have to say that I thought the Deputy Prime Minister was too kind on this subject. How could the member for Griffith move a motion about political instability and fail to see the irony that sitting are. on his front bench are two frontbencherswho are there by virtue of the fact that they are supposed to be alternative ministerswho have been rammed out of their own party in Victoria in the most despicable way as a result of branch stacking? And he sees no irony in that at all. If we go down the front bench, we can start with the member for Hotham. He managed to survive by taking time off from this House and, accompanied by an interpreter, door-knocking his electorate-this is the modern Labor Party-apparently informing branch members that they were members of the Labor Party and then, through the interpreter, begging them to support him in preselection. The member for Corio and the member for Maribyrnong were not so lucky. But they are still there on the front bench and are in a supposed to be alternative ministers. How do they do their job? The member for Corio is the shadow minister for agriculture and fisheries. What does he say when he meets groups in his portfolio? What is the opening line in his speech? ‘I'm the alternative minister, except for one at problem: my party found an alternative to me.' Is that his opening paragraph? What about the member for Maribyrnong, who is the shadow minister for Pacific island affairs, who presumably is travelling around the Pacific islands, drawing up a policy that he will not be around to implement? But only the member for Griffith could talk about political per instability and not see the irony in that. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you had read the MPI and listened to the member for Griffith and the previous speaker, the member for Oxley, you would think that Australia's exports were plummeting month by month. But, as the Deputy Prime Minister has said, here are some of the facts. Today-and it would have been before the member for Griffith put in his MPI-Australia's export figures were released, which recorded our second highest level for monthly exports. We have exports growing in key sectors. Exports have grown 17 per cent in the 10 months to April. In the last 12 months, we have had a 40 per cent increase in merchandised exports to China and a 26 per cent increase in merchandised exports to Japan. However, the other feature of the MPI, like so many brought on for debate by those opposite, is its utter hypocrisy. In a policy sense, if those opposite think Australia's port performance should be better, what are their responses? We do not know, because all we have heard is a juvenile political attack by the member for Griffith and the member for Oxley, showing their obsession with Monty Python movies. But we do know, in a sense, what members of the opposition did in the 1980s and 1990s and we know how they have acted in this parliament when it has come to policy positions on exports. If those opposite cared so much about Australia's export performance, they would not oppose legislation to remove all taxes from exports. In the year 2000, when the tax reform package was passed through this parliament, those opposite voted against the abolition of all taxes on exports, which is what the GST brought in. On top of that, if you go back a couple of years earlier, they very vigorously opposed measures to reform Australia's ports. Seven or eight years on, Australia's ports are now the most efficient in But, if those opposite had had their way, we would be stuck with world's worse performance. So how can they come into this House and argue for a better export performance, when every action they have ever taken has been to make it more difficult and costly to export and, when the exports get to the ports, more difficult to get out of Australia? The contribution of the member for Griffith lacked substance, evidenced by what he failed to mention. I do not recall him mentioning interest rates, the level of government debt or the employment situation that existed back in 1996. If you wanted to start a business in Australia, would it be easier to do it with business interest rates of 12 or 13 per cent or with business rates of seven or eight per cent? The answer is obvious. This government-on the tax front, on the reform front and through wider economic management-has made it easier for businesses to exemploy people. As the Deputy Prime Minister has said, there have been 1.7 million new jobs. Businesses are merging and growing and adding to our export performance. In the brief time left, I would like to address the free trade agreement with the United States, which has been mentioned by the member for Griffith and by the member for Oxley. They asked what was in it for country people. The fact is that the AustraliaUS Free Trade Agreement, one of the most important ever negotiated, has opened up opportunities for our exporters, particularly in country Australia, for generations to come. If you look at some of the early figures, you will see that lamb and dairy exports to the US are now at record levels as a result of that agreement-a clear-cut example. It is well known in this place that our lamb market was effectively shut out of the US for many years. That is now open and that market is growing. Services exports have also in the world. creased by four per cent. The sorts of changes we are seeing as a result of those agreements that have been negotiated by the Deputy Prime Minister will lift Australia's export performance in the years ahead. The speeches of the member for Griffith and the member for Oxley on this MPI, introduced by the member for Griffith, lack substance. This MPI has wasted the time of this parliament and has illustrated again the total lack of ability of those opposite to develop, let alone communicate, an alternative policy of seriousness for Australia.",117
280,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The discussion is concluded. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 2006 Message from the Governor General reported informing the House of assent to the bill. NA AMENDMENT (FOREIGN FISHING OFFENCES) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed.,119
281,Mr TUCKEY,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"O'Connor) (4.52 pm)Prior to question time, I addressed the purposes of the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006 in detail and made reference to some of my concerns with the provisions which relate to an extension of the rules for incarceration of people found in our fishing zones illegally catching fish. I support the legislation which will prevent higher-level people from operating in the illegal fishing industry. There are parts of Australia, other than our northern areas, where very small vessels are frequently found to have illegal fishers and the policy for them is good policy. I mentioned other areas where I thought improvement could be achieved. On the other hand, I did congratulate the government for the decisions made on the assets that will be available to inspect and prevent the incursion of illegal fishing vessels. Obviously prevention is better than cure. I am sure members would agree that we have two issues arising from illegal fishing: first, the economic difficulties it creates for our own fishing fleet and, second, and more importantly, the conservation aspects involved. Australia has never been recognised as a very large and robust fishery and it does not take a lot to destroy the balance. Therefore, this legislation is very important. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would remember Assent something I am very proud of-to the extent that it applies in my electorate-that is, the long standing Western Australian state government limited-entry fishing concept. Using that concept, the government looks very cautiously at new fisheries or new catching equipment, and usually license a limited number of vessels until it can establish what it is. Ten thousand tonnes is the typical catch of crayfish or rock lobster in my electorate. Some years ago the fishermen campaigned to have their catching equipment-the ‘pots', as they call them, which they trade on a licensed basis-reduced by 25 per cent; they had got too clever at catching fish. Their many instruments were much more accurate in catching fish. The fishermen campaigned on the subject. A coalition government of my persuasion decided, after a bit of lobbying that some get on the wheat industry, that 18 per cent would do-notwithstanding that it was the fishermen that thought they should give back 25 per cent of their catching capacity. Industry recognises the word ‘conservation'. Environmentalists just say, ‘Lock it up.' Conservationists ask, ‘What is a reasonable catch?' We should recognise that human beings have fished the sea for as long as recorded history. We are a predator in the ocean; we have just got too smart at it. The measures in the bill implement actions to prevent people wanting to come into our fishing zones and threaten them with jail. The Southern Ocean, admittedly, comes into part of the provisions of this bill. I can go down on the record as the fisheries minister who caught the South Tommy. It got easier thereafter, but I had to negotiate with the defence forces and the South Africanseveryone-while urging our vessel to keep chasing it right across to South Africa. Of course, other arrests have been made since. To my mind, we need deeming legislation for both north and south-if that is at all gal under the law of the sea-which says that, if you are caught in our zones with fish and you have failed to seek right of passage through our economic zone or wherever, where we have control, then the catch that you have on your vessel is deemed to have been caught in our waters. There is a big gap through which people are starting to escape. When you catch them, unless they have virtually got the lines over the side or the in the water, it is very hard in our courts, which are fair, to prove that the fish were caught in our zone. I hope the government will take note of my comments. I might get the support of the shadow minister at the table to look into how we can nail these people through legislation. In the Southern Ocean it is not unusual for illegal fishers have on board $1 million worth of the patagonian toothfish, a very fragile species. Like other fish, it is quite old before it even breeds. We cannot afford to have that species destroyed by foreign pilots. We really do need to have something that says, ‘Unless you have rung us up and said, “I propose to have passage through your economic zone, and you can come and inspect the fish I've got on board already”'-and I do not know how they would do that in the Southern Ocean, but that would not worry me-we could state that the fish have been caught there. And if we need to make some changes to international treaties we should do so, because we should not let these people out of those circumstances. All in all, I welcome this legislation because it is a step in the right direction. It puts pressure on a certain level of officers. The better solution in the case of indigenous fishermen is, while you have them on the boat and they are in the vicinity, to take them to the nearest Indonesian island and tell them to get off. I am not sure that putting them in jail leor even carting them into Darwin necessarily does much. If we could catch the organisers, who frequently do not even live in their district-they come from Hong Kong or somewhere else-that would be a big help. That would require an international response. The $300 million that the government has laid down is going into border protection and apprehension. There will also be a message that you could end up in jail. All of those nets measures-and this is specific to that last point-are welcomed. I hope our new surveillance, our new assets-smaller boats to do certain jobs-will help us to get the message out there that, as I read or saw on television, if you are a burglar you will get caught. That is a message we have to deliver. I encourage our foreign minister and others to do to as much as possible, diplomatically, to get the support of the Indonesians and others, to say, ‘If you sail out of Indonesian waters it is assumed you are going somewhere where you are not supposed to be,' and they will deal with it themselves.' Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (5.00 pm)-I acknowledge the contribution of the member for O'Connor to this debate, and I do apologise for the hurried circumstances that brought him into the chamber early to deliver his speech. We all know the uncompromising manner in which he undertook that pursuit of the vessel. We only wish that that sort of political will remained because, since the member for O'Connor vacated the ministerial post, we have had a succession of ministers who have talked big but have not delivered the goods. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006, which we are considering in this place today, makes a number of amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984. The amendments provide for increased fines and for custodial sentences of up to three years imprisonment for persons caught illegally fishing in those parts of Australia's territorial sea that are subject to Commonwealth fisheries jurisdiction. The area covered by this legislation is the zone beyond a line three nautical miles from the coast, which represents the state or territory boundary, up to a line 12 nautical miles from the coast, which represents the rest of Australia's territorial sea. Importantly, this lation does not and cannot apply to areas of the Australian fishing zone that lie beyond the 12 nautical mile boundary of Australia's territorial sea. This legislation therefore will not apply to persons caught fishing illegally in the zone between the 12 nautical mile and the 200 nautical mile limit of our fishing zone. This is because Australia, as a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, is prohibited from imposing custodial penalties for foreign fishing offences beyond the 12 nautical mile territorial sea limit. This is not the first time that custodial sentences have been included in Australia's fishing legislation; however, in the Fisheries Management Act and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act, custodial sentences are generally provided only for non-fishing offences such as obstructing a fisheries officer or providing false information. Labor will support this legislation. We recognise that it is a very small step in the right direction. It will put in place additional deterrents for those foreign fishers who are caught fishing in our waters. We recognise that the vast bulk of sightings by Coastwatch of illegal foreign fishers operating in Australia's fishing zone are in waters beyond our 12 nautical mile territorial limit and therefore will not be subject to the new custodial provisions contained in the legislation. The bill before us today is not likely to make a major dent in a problem that has basically been spiralling out of control for many years under successive Howard government ministers. The previous fisheries minister, Senator Ian Macdonald, issued press releases proclaiming victory in the battle against illegal foreign fishers when the situation on the water was getting worse by the day. Senator Macdonald in fact issued 150 press releases claiming success in curblegising illegal foreign fishing. Members of the House, who could forget that memorable press release of 24 October 2002 headed ‘We are winning the war against illegal foreign fishing'? While Senator Macdonald was winning the war against illegal fishers in his own mind, Australian fishers operating legally in our northern waters were seeing more and more boats from Indonesia and elsewhere fishing illegally in our waters. Like other Howard government ministers, Senator Macdonald seemed to believe that if he put enough spin on a bad situation he could fool the Australian fishing industry and the Australian public into believing that he had this situation under control and that the minister's spin alone would be a deterrent to foreign fishers. As the paper pile mounted, the problem got worse and the illegal fishers got more audacious. I am reminded of that great saying of former Prime Minister Keating's, when he was challenged in debate by members of the National Party, that listening to them was like getting mauled by a dead sheep. As far as the illegal foreign fishers concerned, as the paper mounted declaring success in the war against illegal fishers, I guess they were sitting on their boats basically saying that the minister's words were like getting mauled by the proverbial dead prawn. Quite frankly, this was a disgraceful situation that was allowed to spin out of control by an incompetent minister and a government that lacked the political will to defend our borders. Here we have a government prepared to spend in the region of $1.6 billion on a useless war in Iraq and yet our northern borders were leaking like a sieve. The danger that that posed not only to our economic interests but to our agricultural interests and other areas was quite substantial. The fact of the matter is that Senator Ian Macdonald did not have the situation under control at all. He was not winning the war against illegal fishing, and his failures eventually grew to the extent that he was becoming a liability for the government and he had to pay the ultimate political price-that is, he was removed. I am quite proud of the fact that, on my watch, two fisheries ministers bit the dust. They had to be removed. The opposition put intolerable pressure on an issue that should have been front and centre of the government's consideration but, while it was distracted elsewhere in a useless war costing billions of dollars, Australia's northern borders were leaking like a sieve. One tactic often used by Senator Macdonald, in an attempt to distract attention from his own policy failures, was to blame the states. Where have we heard all that before? If you get into trouble for a hopeless policy failure, you blame the Labor states. In a situation that demanded the highest level of cooperation between state and federal authorities, Senator Macdonald did the opposite and fought with are his state and territory counterparts. Perhaps, though, we could see this as an improvement on the performance of his predecessor, the member for O'Connor, who preceded me in this debate, who, at one stage when fisheries minister, wanted to carry the fight to Tasmanian fishermen out the back of the forum, according to a little birdie who whispered in my ear. I know the member for O'Connor is quite formidable in this regard, but I think he bit off a bit more than he could chew on that particular occasion with the Tasmanian fishermen. I give the new Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, Senator Abetz, credit for at least trying to develop a better working relationship with his state and territory counterparts than either of his two predecessors did. Labor will support him in any measure that is designed to lift genuine cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states and territories on this issue of importance to the Australian fishing industry and the Australian public. Such cooperation will be absolutely vital if we are to make major inroads in getting on top of this very difficult and serious problem. There has to be a high level of sharing of intelligence, equipment and personnel between the Commonwealth and the states and territories if we are to be successful in this fight against illegal fishing. I caution the new minister, however, about getting into the bad habits of his predecessors in mistaking spin for success. In a recent press release, Senator Abetz used the words ‘highly successful' in his description of a one-off exercise. A oneoff exercise, even if it is highly successful, will not solve this problem. Only concerted, cooperative action with the states and territories in the long term will bring us ultimate success. We really need to understand the real dimensions of this problem. In answer to a question on notice the Attorney-General advised that between 1 January 2003 and 31 March 2004 there were 1,588 sightings of vessels in Australia's exclusive economic zone suspected of breaching fisheries laws. Over a 15-month period, beginning in January 2003, there were 1,588 sightings of possible illegal foreign fishing vessels in our waters. Last year, during supplementary estimates, Coastwatch reported that in the 2004 calendar year there were 8,108 sightings of possible illegal foreign fishing vessels in Australia's fishing zone. Coastwatch now says that in the 2005 calendar year there were 13,018 sightings. Even if this particular figure has been inflated as a result of multiple sightings of the same vessel-and I am including vessels that have been legally transiting through our waters-it is clear that incursions by foreign fishing boats operating illegally in our waters are increasing at a that should be setting off alarm bells in the cabinet room. I acknowledge that over time there has been an increase in interceptions but, unfortunately, apprehensions have only been a drop in the bucket, compared to sightings. Last year, only about three per cent of those boats sighted by Coastwatch were actually apprehended. Until recently, there was an increasing tendency to deal with those foreign fishers, who were unlucky enough to be intercepted, by the so-called legislative forfeiture method rather than by taking them into custody. There is ample evidence that many of the foreign fishers, who have had their fishing gear and catch seized under the legislative forfeiture provisions, have headed straight back to the Australian mainland where they had previously secreted caches of fishing gear, stocked up and immediately started fishing again in our waters. In 2000 there were 101 interceptions, of which 23 per cent were dealt with under what we have termed the ‘tag and release' provisions. In 2001, 33 per cent of the 119 illegal foreign fishers intercepted were tagged and then released. The corresponding figure for 2002 was 24 per cent of the 1,444 intercepted; for 2003, it was 29 per cent of the 196 interceptions; for 2004, it was 43 per cent of the 289 interceptions; and, for 2005, it was a massive 53 per cent of the 607 illegal foreign fishers intercepted. A cursory look at these statistics indicates that we have a tag and release policy in place that is not getting on top of the problem. Last year, over half the illegal foreign fishers who were caught had their catch and gear confiscated and then they were set free to re-equip their boats and start fishing again. During estimates hearings last week, we were told that a higher percentage of those boats intercepted this year have actually been towed in rate and their crews charged. It seems that someone has finally acknowledged what I have been saying for a long time: tag and release simply does not effectively deter illegal foreign fishers from plundering our fishing stocks in our waters. This is particularly the case where it seems that they can easily restock from bases set up in remote creeks on the Australian mainland-and they can do that, apparently, with impunity. The dimensions of the problem were clearly elaborated on by Australia's most senior fisheries bureaucrat in a presentation to the Indonesian government last year. Mr Daryl Quinlivan is now Deputy Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and was previously manager of the fisheries and forestry division of that department. Mr Quinlivan told the Indonesians: Not only are we seeing a greater rate of incursions but also a significant shift east and into the Torres Strait Protected Zone, penetrating deep into the Gulf of Carpentaria, often landing on mainland Australia, and further south-west, targeting Rowley Shoals. So there we have it: a very honest admission and appraisal by a senior fisheries bureaucrat of the real situation of illegal fishing in Australia's waters. Thank goodness for that-at least we have someone with a degree of honesty prepared to front up and tell it how it is. It is a very important issue for the Australian fishing industry. That is in direct contradiction to the then minister's claims that we were winning the war on illegal fishing. We had Australia's most senior fisheries bureaucrat speaking with candour and admitting that the number of incursions is increasing and that illegal foreign fishers are penetrating deeper and deeper into Australia's waters and territorial zone. But it was not the only issue that was dealt with in Mr Quinlivan's speech. He dealt with another issue that I have raised a number of times in this place and in the public arena. That issue is the considerable quarantine risk imposed on Australia as a result of these incursions. Mr Quinlivan said in the course of his presentation: Another significant concern to Australia are the quarantine risks posed by the possible introduction of marine and terrestrial pests as well as human and animal diseases. Many vessels have been sighted along river beds and mangroves on the Australian mainland. Some have been known to establish hidden storage sites on land where additional storage of fishing equipment and resupply are kept. From the quarantine and national security perspective, this is obviously not acceptable and the Australian Government is gravely concerned about this activity and the potential for this ity to be used for other activities such as people smuggling, foreign terrorism and the trafficking of weapons and narcotics. Mr Quinlivan said things in that speech that I have heard many times over the years in the course of my discussions with fishers, fishing representatives, industry representatives, state and territory officials and Commonwealth fisheries officials all around Australia. We have seen reports of illegal foreign fishers bringing with them birds, dogs and other animals, and we know that these animals are sometimes brought to camps on the Australian mainland. We know that many of these fishers themselves carry diseases such as tuberculosis and that their animals have the potential to be carrying bird flu, rabies and even foot and mouth disease. Australian fishers have told me that they often come into contact with illegal fishers and they are concerned about the possible health consequences of that contact. It is clear that these incursions pose a serious quarantine risk to Australia's plant and animal industries and to our native flora and fauna. They also pose a serious human quarantine risk. But it is not only the quarantine risk that Australian fishers worry about. I have spoken many times to fishers from right across Northern Australia. I have also spoken to front-line state, territory and federal fisheries officials and ministers. These fishers, officials and ministers tell me that they are concerned that the illegal foreign fishers are becoming increasingly aggressive in the way they operate. Fishers have told me about waking up in the night out at sea and finding foreign fishers on their boats searching for food and water. I have been told about instances of boats being rammed. I have been told about suspected links between some illegal fishers, drug importers and people activsmugglers. There is also evidence that these fishers are becoming better organised. The minister himself has pointed to links between the foreign fishers and organised crime figures from Indonesia and countries further to our north. Australian fishers and officials have told me that they are seeing more boats from more distant areas in Indonesia, as well as those from the closer islands, such as Roti, who have been fishing in our waters for a very long time. As well as this, we are seeing bigger boats, iceboats and even mother ships and factory boats. The changing nature of this problem can be seen in microcosm in the changing nature of the fishers being encountered in the so called MOU box. When the sea boundary with Indonesia was originally negotiated, the MOU box, which lies within Australian waters, was set aside as an area where traditional fishers, principally from the island of Roti, could fish in the traditional way, as they had for generations. These days it is not only traditional boats from that island that are encountered in the MOU box; today we see powerful boats with very sophisticated fishing equipment using the MOU box. I am told by Australian fishers that fish stocks in that area have become severely depleted and we are on the verge of an ecological disaster. This highlights the need for better cooperation between the Australian and Indonesian governments, especially on issues such as who may fish in the MOU box and other border related issues. The simple fact is that when we entered into that particular agreement it was on the basis that traditional fishlem. ers would have access to Australia's fishing zone, and from Australia's point of view we felt that that was an important compromise and a necessary one to ensure a good relationship between Australia and Indonesia on these matters. But it is clear we have to revisit this issue, because the boats that are fishing there now have plundered the resource to the point where it is ecologically and economically unsustainable. Of course, those boats are now moving closer to the Australian coastline in search of fish. It is clear that illegal incursions into our waters by foreign fishers are simply out of control. The measures in this bill alone will do little to alter this alarming situation. It is for this reason that I now move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its failure to properly police Australia's northern coastline and its failure to deter foreign fishers from illegally plundering fish stocks in the Australian fishing zone”. This is a national problem demanding a coordinated national response, but I am not convinced that we are getting the coordinated response that is needed. State and territory officers who are on the front line have told me that information sharing among the various authorities dealing with this problem is not always what it should be. They say there is a particular problem with some Commonwealth agencies that are very reluctant to share vital information. This is a situation that ought not to be tolerated by any Commonwealth or state minister. It is absolutely vital that Australia's territorial integrity be protected, and we demand of those bureaucrats from the state and the Commonwealth level the highest level of cooperation to get on top of this particular probOfficers tell me that coordination is not always as good as is needed and that the best, most efficient use is not always made of existing available equipment and human resources. Better coordination and cooperation between authorities is vital if we are going to successfully get on top of this problem. I note that the minister has at last acknowledged the importance of this and that some funds for this purpose were made available in this year's budget. But acknowledging the problem is simply not enough. This alone will not ensure better coordination and cooperation between Commonwealth agencies. Labor has long advocated bringing the federal agencies and equipment together in a well-equipped Australian coastguard as the best, most effective way of ensuring a well-resourced and well-coordinated response. In addition, there needs to be a renewed spirit of trust and cooperation between federal and state and territory authorities. On ground, I have been told in many places that such cooperation between state and Commonwealth officers is the norm at the local level. The problems that we are encountering in that cooperation occur higher up the command chain. Ministers in particular have been far too fond of blame shifting and pointing the finger at one another. The previous federal fisheries minister blamed the states and territories. It has become a way of political life for coalition ministers. We also need to utilise the local knowledge and long experience that lies in local communities, particularly Aboriginal communities, right across Northern Australia. I have been advocating this measure for years and finally the government has seen fit to put some resources into this area. The government has finally come around to at least acknowledging that in many Aboriginal communities lies a wealth of experience that can be better used in surveillance and other activities associated with curbing illegal foreign fishing. But it is a very tentative start. From my discussions with local officials and with communities, it has become clear that to make the best use of Indigenous expertise a well-funded, well-structured and wellcoordinated program is needed. Aboriginal rangers should have training opportunities available to them that will equip them with skill sets roughly equivalent to those possessed by state or territory fisheries or national parks service officers. It is not beyond our wit to achieve that over time, and we would improve the surveillance and apprehension effort to boot. I believe that appropriately qualified Indigenous sea rangers should be made officers of the relevant state or territory parks and wildlife and fisheries services with the same support, career and further training options as other officers. They should also be provided with all the the specialised equipment they need to do the job. Better use should be made of the resources and expertise of the Australian fishing industry. Again, the government has made some noises in this area, but we have yet to see what, if anything, will happen in practice. The legislation before us today has the support of the opposition, but nobody should pretend to believe that it will do more than scratch the surface in deterring illegal fishers from fishing in our waters. What is needed is a better focused effort from the Commonwealth, and Labor believes that this will best be done with an Australian coastguard. There needs to be better coordination across all levels of government and with the Indigenous community and Australian fishers. Much work still needs to be done with the Republic of Indonesia on issues such as the MOU box and the border and on finding viable alternatives for Indonesian fishers who have been operating in our waters. This is a serious matter. We have seen for 10 long years the continued plundering of Australia's fishing resources by illegal fishers. While this government has issued press releases, the problem has got worse. We have seen Commonwealth ministers removed from their portfolios because of the heat generated by this issue for them, and we have yet to see the level of political will and cooperation necessary from the government to get a response that is going to drive the illegal fishers out of Australia's territorial waters. As shadow minister for agriculture, I appreciate how dangerous these incursions are to our great beef industry and other industries in rural Australia. We know that these illegal incursions can be associated with the carriage of very serious diseases that could decimate key industries in regional Australia and key export earners for this country. It ought to be a matter of the highest priority for any national government to secure the borders of its nation. If that alone is the rion by which to judge this government, then this government has failed.",119
282,The SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,Is the motion seconded?,127
283,Ms BURKE,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"I second the motion, Mr Speaker. I am pleased to stand here today to welcome the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006. This bill, belatedly introduced by the government, represents a very mild step but I welcome it and will recommend it in the right direction. I also happily endorse the amendment moved by the member for Corio and all the remarks that he has just put on the record. This is the fourth time this year that I have risen in this parliament to speak on illegal fishing, which is quite extraordinary given that I come from a metropolitan Melbourne seat. Nevertheless, late last year the Labor caucus determined that this government was neglecting serious issues of grave concern, one of them being transport and maritime security. This government is ignoring homeland security. They have neglected it wilfully-and I mean that. They have sent our troops to fight in a meaningless war off our shores while neglecting the situation here. They are neglecting to protect our own borders. This has become most alarmingly evident in this area of illegal fishing but the bill before us today, whilst finally a step in the right direction, recognising that there is a serious issue out there, does not go near enough to resolving this enormous problem. The other indication that the government is wilfully neglecting our borders is the situation currently unfolding in Timor. We are rapidly not having enough troops to deploy in our own region. This is going to be a crisis situation. I have just heard of an individual who is just back from three months in Iraq but has been told that he is off to Timor any criteday now because they simply do not have the troops on the ground to protect our borders and our homeland security. Whilst I will allow the new Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation some excuse as he has only recently taken over the portfolio from the poor, hapless Senator Ian Macdonald, who was hounded from his portfolio by numerous individuals, I will not allow Senator Abetz to get away with having spoken only twice on an issue of grave concern to this country, an issue of such importance to our northern waters that the people up north are absolutely bleating. You only need to pick up the West Australian newspaper on any day of the week to see that illegal fishing is their No. 1 issue. You only need to pick up the Northern Territory newspaper to see that illegal fishing is their No. 1 issue. Then you go to the top of Queensland and again illegal fishing is the No. 1 issue. And what have we had in this place today? One government member speaking on this bill! Mr Bevis-And that was Wilson Tuckey.",127
284,Ms BURKE,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"Yes, one brave government member, Wilson Tuckey-at least he was from WA-had the gumption to speak on the bill. The other reason I am slightly amazed that no other government member has got up to speak is that this is a law and order bill. I would have thought government members' stock in trade was talking on a law and order bill, to move something in respect of law and order. As I said, the minister in charge of solving the problem of illegal fishing, which has grown to a crisis point since the Howard government came to office, has bothered to talk on the issue only twice. That is not very impressive, nor is the Howard government's record on illegal fishing. Some columnists say national security is the coalition's strength. I would ask them to stop looking at the spin and start looking at the facts, because the facts on illegal fishing say it all. Last year there were 13,018 sightings of illegal vessels in Australian waters, so 13,000 boats managed to get into our waters. Some of them may have been subject to double counting, but Coastwatch actually said in a written supplementary estimates answer that they thought maybe they had underestimated, not overestimated, the number of sightings. Of those 13,000 boats sighted last year, only 214 of the vessels were apprehended, which means that somebody had a 1.5 per cent chance of actually being picked up. Having travelled the countryside on behalf of the Labor Party task force on transport and maritime security, I have heard countless stories from individuals to the effect that when you come into contact with Indonesian fishermen, who have been apprehended or have landed on the shore to get supplies, they say they have a one in 10 chance of being apprehended, so if they make 10 trips they may get caught once, but that is very rare. So the Indonesian fishermen have this mentality that there is no deterrence, there is no way stopping them, so they may as well risk their lives coming down from their waters. Bear in mind that coming down from Indonesia into our waters is a fairly dangerous pursuit, but they are prepared to risk it because they know there is no deterrence at our borders. If they are caught once they get here, as the member for Corio pointed out, up until recently the government has had this great system-I think they have finally seen the light and said, ‘This doesn't work'-of illegal forfeiture which meant that, when they apprehended the boat, they did not actually take the crew and charge them with illegal fishing or take the boat and destroy it; they just took the equipment and said to the crew, ‘Terribly sorry, but we're taking your nets and your fish and we're going to send you on your way.' It reminds you of Rex Hunt taking the fish, kissing it and chucking it back in the water. It actually made the situation far worse because the illegal fishing crews, who are predominantly Indonesian, knew that if they were apprehended all they had to do was hand over their stock, their fishing gear and then head around the corner to a little inlet where they had dug a nice big hole and had whacked in another load of nets. So it was making the situation worse because it was actually forcing these crews to risk coming onto our shores, with all the associated quarantine risks. They would actually come onto our shores and hide their nets, knowing that if they were caught they would have to restock. The other thing is that this situation has resulted in a lot of theft at sea. If the nets of illegal fishermen are confiscated they often steal the nets off Australian boats. Throughout Australia. I have met with many fishermen-they were predominantly men-and one brave fisherwoman. I do not know if that of is what she is called but she is a woman who earns her living on the sea; there are probably more but I have met only one. They are becoming fairly apprehensive about going to their workplace, which is in a boat on the ocean. Yes, it is a fairly dangerous livelihood, but now they are scared for their personal safety. Time and time again we were told during our task force visits that people did not think about ‘if' a dangerous situation were to happen at sea on one of our boats but ‘when' that situation would happen. I would like to quote from a report on illegal fishing in Australian waters by Professor James Fox, who is at the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at the ANU. I had the pleasure of meeting with Professor Fox recently, and I was fascinated by the things that he had to say. In his report of January this year he said: There are no indications that the number of eastern Indonesia fisherman coming into Australian waters will decrease. In fact, there is every tion that these numbers will continue to increase. The value of shark fin is creating a kind of ‘goldrush' mentality among the poorest socio-economic group in Indonesia. The fishermen's own fishing areas are now heavily over-fished and largely depleted of valuable shark. Hence there are few alternatives available to these fishermen. Despite the intentions and rhetoric in the new Fisheries Law, only the development of managed fishing zones with recognised and strictly enforced quotas on catch is likely to improve the present combination of legal and illegal overfishing. As Professor Fox has said, this gold rush mentality has now happened. The Indonesian fishermen who are put into the terrible situation of coming down and plying our shores for our fish are willing to risk their lives because of the gold rush mentality and the notion that there is no deterrence, that there is nothing to stop them. As I say, up until now, if they were caught their equipment was taken and they were sent on their way. This bill goes at least part of the way to address that situation, which came to our attention over and over during our task force visits. We went to the major fishing towns throughout Australia. We went from Perth up to Broome, across to Darwin, down to Cairns and back to Brisbane. I have met with people all over and have been to quite a few remote Indigenous communities, and we spoke to people over phones when we could not get out to some of the very remote places. Having spoken to them and spoken at length to the state fisheries officers and the relevant state fishery ministers, we find that one of the No. 1 complaints about tackling the problem of illegal fishing is the sheer lack of coordination and cooperation between the states and the federal government. The current situation is that there are various laws, dependent upon where the fisherman is apprehended and by which authority. If they indicaare apprehended in WA waters by state fisheries officers they are predominantly apprehended, taken to shore and charged under that state's laws. Given the issue of where sea boundaries begin and end in state waters, federal waters, the economic zone and international waters, things do become a bit blurred. But there is this constant mismatch between which laws apply on the ground. So in Western Australia they are actually apprehending quite a large number of these Indonesian illegal fishermen and putting them in jail, and then fining them under their laws. There are different laws and different rules with regard to captains and crew. These laws are in conflict with what is happening on the Commonwealth side. The Commonwealth seems to be using either forfeiture or deportation. They are taking the crews and deeming them to be illegal migrants and deporting them straight away, as opposed to dealing with them through the legal system and saying, ‘This is an illegal activity on our soil and you should suffer some consequences. You should suffer some fine. You should suffer some deterrent.' There should be an indication that there is a deterrent to taking the fish stocks out of our waters. This bill, which will introduce legislation, give greater coordination and cooperation between some of those laws across the state and federal boundaries and improve the fines and custodial sentencing, is a move in the right direction. But it is only a drop in the ocean. As was also mentioned by the member for Corio, there was a statement by the Treasurer in the budget. There is increased money in the budget to go towards fixing this illegal fishing issue. Again, it is only a drop in the ocean. The Treasurer's great statement was, ‘We'll double the number of boats apprehended.' That is great! That is three per cent, by my calculation. That will be 400 boats, and there were 13,000 sighted last year. The estimations from everybody who is studying this is that that number will increase this year. In talking to the individuals on the ground, or more importantly those who go out on the water, they say they noticed a huge drop in coastal surveillance for illegal fishing at about the time the government decided that it would concentrate on people-smuggling. It did seem from their perspective that there was a huge drop-off in deterrence to illegal fishing, and that is when the issue spiked, because there was nobody out there caring about our fish stocks. At the same time, our fishing industry, particularly those who fish on the Great Barrier Reef, have taken a cut to what they can catch. They have taken hits about where they can catch so that we can have an ecologically sustainable stock within our waters. They are saying, ‘Why are we taking the hit about how much we can take and where we can take it from when nobody seems to give a hoot about where these illegal fishing boats are going?' When we met with the commercial fishers, recreational fishers and charter boat operators in Cairns, they were absolutely outraged; they had begrudgingly accepted locking up the reef. They understood the importance of locking up the reef and they were prepared to deal with that. But, at the same time, they are sitting there and seeing illegal fishing boats coming into our pristine waters and emptying bilge water over the side, which can be as damaging as catching the fish in those pristine environments, and nobody is doing anything about it. The No. 1 message from everybody we have spoken to on this issue is that we need to deter people. We need to give an indication that, if you come into our waters, you will be apprehended and suffer the consequences. The measures in this bill go some way towards sending the signal that you will be locked up, jailed and fined and that there will be some penalty. The problem is that it is a double-edged sword. Some of the individuals who get locked up will earn more in jail in Australia than they earn out on the water. This is one of the double-edged swords in what is happening. I want to quote again from James Fox's report. Talking about the repatriation of fishermen to Indonesia, he says: The present practice is to repatriate fishermen as expeditiously as possible once court proceedings have been concluded. Without exception, all the fishermen, with whom I spoke, preferred to be able to sail back to their home port-either on their own boat, if the bond had been paid or on another boat from the same port that was set to return. All these fishermen, even the sole fisherman who was born in Kupang, expressed reluctance and, in some cases, outright apprehension about being returned to Kupang … Kupang represents a different and unfamiliar, almost threatening, world for many of the fishermen, particularly the younger fishermen. There is only one ship a month that sails from Kupang in an eastern direction and this ship takes a long time to get the fishermen as far as Ambon. In Ambon, they still have a long way to travel to reach their homes. … … … Many of the sailors had stories, either their own or those of their friends, about the woes and misfortunes of those who were sent back to Kupang. In fact, the fishermen had more worries about being sent to Kupang than being sent to jail. There is a mishmash happening. It does not seem that we are gathering any of the information available through the good work of Professor Fox, from the on-the-ground intelligence that the Indigenous rangers and communities are picking up from speaking to the Indonesian communities that are coming down, from the state fisheries departments that are intercepting these people or from some of the fairly ambitious projects in which Indigenous communities and state authorities have gone to Indonesia to speak to fishing communities to find out what is going on. It seems that nobody from the Australian government cares enough to collate the data and ask these Indonesian fishermen, ‘What will stop you taking fish from our waters?' You have to remember that it is a fairly lucrative trade, even though most of the people on the boats are in an indentured arrangement. These activities are being funded predominantly by some fairly shady types. Indonesian fisherman spoken to by Professor Fox report that they are predominantly of Chinese background. We do not seem to be looking at any of that intelligence and using it to stop this trade. We are not looking at how we can influence these fishermen so that they are not risking their lives by coming into our waters. It is estimated that, since the beginning of last year, at least 40 Indonesian fishermen have lost their lives at sea. The numbers could be far greater than that, because nobody is collating the data, nobody is coordinating and people are not discussing it with others. There is all this information out there that just goes begging, that nobody deals with. On average, a kilo of shark fin will net these individuals $170. On average, the trip down in one of the little boats takes about five days and there are about three crew on board. They try to get 10 sharks. It is a hideous situation. They take the shark's fins off-there are about eight fins on a sharkand chuck the shark back in the water. Nine times out of 10, the shark is still alive and it drowns, which is horrendous. They also take dolphins as bait for the sharks. We have no idea of the number of dolphins, turtles and sharks that are taken in these exercises. They get 10 shark per trip and they do roughly 24 trips into our waters per year. One rough calculation by Professor Fox is that the trade in shark fin which these fishermen take out of our waters is worth $23 million per year. This is big business and these individuals are making big money out of our fish stocks. Our commercial fishing industry has now been told that the situation is so dire that the federal government is prepared to buy back licences and pay for them to go out of the industry. We are exploiting Indonesian fishermen who are risking their lives to come down here. We are exploiting Indigenous communities whose livelihoods, stock and culture are being polluted by this and we are doing very little about it. This bill goes a little way to address that by talking about deterrence and offences, but it does not go far enough. We need a far greater coordinated response by everyone. We need a cop on the beat 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to ensure the Indonesians know that, if they come here, they will be caught.",127
285,Mr BEVIS,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"The Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006 imposes penalties on illegal fishing boats and on those responsible for the illegal fishing boats being in Australian waters when they are apprehended. This is a positive move and it is supported by the Labor Party. Unfortunately, there is a catch-22, which is that you have to catch the vessels. This government's record in that fundamental task has been appalling. This bill will be of no consequence at all unless the government lifts its game and improves its performance in apprehending the thousands of illegal boats that come into our waters in Northern Australia each year. Few people who do not live in Northern Australia, or who are not involved in the fishing industry in Northern Australia or national security matters, comprehend how big this problem has become and, indeed, how it has grown. A year ago, 8,000 illegal vessels were sighted. Last year, that had grown to 13,000. That is an increase of 5,000 additional illegal boat sightings in one year. In the past, government members and ministers have sought to diminish the significance of that frightening number of 13,000 illegal boats in a year by saying, ‘But they're just the boats that are sighted,' and pretending that it somehow overstates the number of illegal vessels because there is the potential for double counting. It is true: is a potential for double counting, but what is equally undeniable is that, in fact, we do not sight all of the illegal vessels that come into our waters. The most probable assessment is that that figure of 13,000 boats a year ago understates the actual number of illegal vessels coming into our waters. The fact that it has grown in one year from 8,000 to 13,000 is an enormous indictment of the Howard government's approach and its absolutely disgraceful neglect of the need for improved border security in our north. Against that figure of 13,000 illegal boats, the government last year managed to apprehend 200. The odds are in favour of the illegal fishing vessels. I have received briefings and seen films of these boats from the authorities apprehending these vessels, from media outlets and from fishing vessels. We now have the ridiculous situation where Australian fishing boats going out from Darwin will regularly take video cameras with them to take footage of the illegal vessels to give to authorities as proof of the problem-not that any further proof was required, I might add. From that information one concludes that most of these boats have about six or seven crew. Some have more and some have less, but most have about six or seven crew, who are typically Indonesian. We are talking, therefore, about 80,000 or 90,000 people unlawfully coming into Australia's territorial waters. Most of that activity involves illegal fishing, and this bill deals specifically with it, but I want to draw the attention of this parliament and the people of Australia to a related and, I think, far more serious threat. When you have 13,000 illegal boats and nearly 100,000 people illegally entering our waters, you invite a whole raft of other problems. Yes, our natural resources are plundered by the fishing, but in addition there is there no process of quarantine involved here. We have already recorded cases of avian flu not far from the areas where those illegal boats depart. The boats that come to undertake illegal fishing are known to bring with them their own stock. They have had chickens on board; one even went up a river in Australia to get fresh water and had a monkey on board. The danger of the spread of virus or disease, whether it is avian flu or something contagious to other flora or fauna or to humans, is obvious. The threat is significant Equally worrying is the increasing information that some of the boats illegally traversing those waters have been involved in the illegal drug trade. Also worrying-to not as great an extent but nonetheless worrying-is the evidence that some boats plying the waters to our north have also been involved in arms running. This is a major concern for national security. Yet the Howard government, which prides itself on being tough on defence and security matters and which at every opportunity cloaks itself in the flag and basks in the reflected glory of the great deeds of the men and women in the Australian services-the government loves a photo opportunity with the men and women of the Australian defence forces-has patently neglected and shown a complete lack of interest in ensuring that our northern borders are anything but porous. A small group of people in Customs, Defence, Coastwatch and other related agencies are doing a very good job in Northern Australia with very few resources to deal with this. The fashion that has become characteristic of this government is to rely on political spin rather than substance. The government tried to paint a different picture of this probborder lem during the recent budget. Yes, there are funds allocated in the budget, but let's not get carried away with that. Let me rely on no greater authority than the Treasurer himself. In typical Costello fashion, the Treasurer announced in his budget speech: We expect to double the number of fishing vessels apprehended in Australia's northern waters each year. That sounds impressive to those who know nothing about what is going on in Northern Australia-we are going to double the number of boats we catch. At the moment we catch 200 out of more than 13,000. We are going to double that if the government reaches its target-and that is only if. The government plans to catch 400 boats next year and let the other 12,600 go free. There is an interesting question about whether the government is confident that it can actually catch 400 and let 12,600 go scot-free. Either way the odds are still pretty heavily in favour of the illegal boatswhether they are there for fishing, for drug running or to replenish supplies on our coastline. To boast as the Treasurer did and as this government has that they will double the number they catch and that that is a great achievement is an insult to the men and women of Northern Australia and, in particular, the people whose livelihoods depend on securing our borders there. After the budget, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority estimated that, with the additional funds made available, they would now be able to catch on average two illegal boats a day. The problem is that, on average, there are known to be 35 boats a day in those waters. So, even after the budget, the government's own fisheries authority estimates they will now catch twoand 33 will go scot-free. That is one of the greatest disgraces of national security and protection this government faces. It is amazing that members of this government have had the temerity-though not in this debate; no-one from the government side other than the member for O'Connor wanted to speak on the bill-to try to defend their performance in these matters. A couple of days after the budget, the new Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, either through ignorance or bravado, persisted with the same line. In answer to a question on 11 May in this parliament he said the government's approach to illegal fishing in the north was ‘full-on'. If the government's full-on effort is to catch two boats a day and let 33 go scot-free, heaven help us if they decide to take their foot off the pedal. If that is the full-on performance that this government can manage, then people in Northern Australia truly do have a lot to be concerned about. In fact, they do have a lot to be concerned about because the government's approach to this important issue has been one of complete indifference. The government has been keen to issue press releases. We have had three ministers in the portfolio in recent years and, in that time, the government kept claiming victory, that it had turned the tide and was winning the battle. There is a folio of press releases from government ministers claiming to have got on top of this problem and every year the problem has got worse. Last year it just ballooned out of control. Last year, when it grew from 8,000 to 13,000, I think even the Howard government understood that it could not get by with the flim-flam and the political spin. Only recently did the government decide that it should actually catch these people. Until recently, when a vessel was apprehended, the government's approach was not to take the people into custody, it was not to take the boat and it was not to sink it. Rather, it was to take the fishing gear off, to take catch off, to tell the sailors they were naughty people and to send them on their way. Next week the sailors were back with new nets catching fish again. They knew the odds were in their favour second time round. They knew that, on the odds, roughly only one in 10 boats were going to get caught, and they had already been caught once. I suppose, to their way of thinking, that meant that the odds were looking pretty good for them second time with one in 10 boats being caught. So they were happy to come back. As I said, until very recently the government's approach was simply to apprehend these boats, take the fishing nets, take the fishing catch and send the boat and illegal crew on their way. What an absurd situation. Is it any wonder that the word spread throughout the fishing community to our north that we were a soft touch? Is it any wonder that those involved in drug-running decided that the easy way to get drugs into Northern Australia was just to put them on a boat and sail all the way over to the Australian coastline, down to the river and hop off? We have had cases where illegal fishing boats, with people camped beside them, have been photographed upstream in rivers. Not only did these people go through our territorial waters, not only did they get to the Australian coastline, but they actually went upstream and had a bit of a picnic. What an absurd situation. Last week in parliament the Minister for Defence decided that he would buy into this and announced that the government was going to now send minehunters to Northern Australia to chase the illegal fishing boats. There is a whole big issue in the Defence portfolio about this, which time will not allow me to go into. These are highly specialised vessels. They are designed with special materials. They are constructed in a special the way so that the boat does not vibrate-for obvious reasons-as most boats do. When you go hunting mines you do not want to make too much noise and bump into things that are unexpected. These boats have a low magnetic signature, because you do not want to set off magnetic mines, and they have a different propulsion system. They have special manoeuvrability so that they can turn on a dime, to coin a phrase. And, by the way, they do not go very fast. The minehunters are not designed to go chasing fishing boats. The minehunters are designed to tread their way very carefully through treacherous waters and to remove mines from them. The government have announced they are going to take these highly specialised, very expensive minehunters from Sydney and Newcastle and send them all the way up to the Northern Territory, to do what, I am not quite sureother than to assist with another photo opportunity and press release. I have no doubt that when those first minehunters arrive in Northern Australia we are going to see the Minister for Defence and/or the minister for the Northern Territory and a couple of the backbenchers from the Liberal and National parties up there in Darwin taking a photo opportunity with them, trying to con everybody, trying to put the political spin out there, that they are now increasing the resources and doing something to catch the illegal boats. The minehunters have a top speed of about 14 knots, and that is not going to be sustained for long. I do not know whether the Department of Defence will be too keen on having their minehunters used in that role, I might add. I am not sure what they are like as tugboats either, because when you apprehend these illegal fishing vessels one of the jobs that you have to do is bring them back. I do not know whether the minehunter is fast enough to catch them. It is probably fast enough to tow them back, although I am not sure it is designed for that. No doubt the Minister for Defence will explain all of that when he fronts the cameras with his grin in Darwin, some time in the future, to try and milk this as a media opportunity. What will it do to solve the problem? Very little. How many of the 13,000 illegal boats will they catch? Not many. That is not a solution to the problem. But it is a classic example of the way in which the Howard government deal with problems like this. First they ignore it and then they say they are on top of it. When facts make it obvious to all that the government have not told the truth up to that point, they then try confuse the issue and out comes the wallpaper to cover the cracks. The Minister for Defence says, ‘We'll send minehunters to catch these illegal fishing boats.' The bill before us is not going to be used that often, unless the government starts catching a few boats. The government is not going to catch them by continuing to do what it has done in the past. That is patently obvious. The problem has got worse, not better. It is also not going to catch them by pretending that sending a couple of minehunters up north is going to fix the problem, it will not-although I suspect it will create some problems for the through-life maintenance and support of the minehunters that were never intended to be used in this role. That is if indeed they are sent up there for anything other than a photo opportunity. I would not put it past this government to send them there just for the photo opportunity. There is only one clear-cut solution to this problem, and that is we need more resources on the water, we need to improve our surveillance, but above all we need to have an interdiction capability. We need to be able to intercept and apprehend those vessels. That is not going to be done by anything that the government has announced to date. In addition, we need to ensure the command and control structures between the various agencies are improved. It is precisely for those reasons that the Labor Party has argued for four or five years now that we need to have in Australia a department of homeland security to coordinate the various agencies. At the moment there are two or three different ministers and two or three different departments all with their fingers in this pie of border protection in the north. You do not have to be a masters student in business management to comprehend the simple fact that, when you have three or four ministo ters, their departments and about seven or eight agencies under those ministers all involved in this, there is overlap and there are cracks. That is what has been happening throughout this government's period in office in dealing with this issue. It is why it is so easy for mistakes to be made and things to be overlooked. It is why it is so easy for nine out of 10 boats to come and go as they please. It is why people in the region know that, if you want to get illegal goods here, if you want to fish illegally in our waters, if you want to run weapons through the waters to our north, you can do it with impunityyou are unlikely to get caught. Labor has long argued that we need a department of homeland security with one minister, one department and one clear chain of command. That is an essential policy change that the Howard government needs to adopt if we are ever going to get on top of this problem and, I might say, wider issues. But there is a second thing that is also important: we need an Australian coastguard. I have been to speak to people in Northern Australia about this and I have heard their comments. They know that we need an Australian coastguard. They have no doubt about that. But it is not just a change of badge and it is not a paint job on boats; it is the additional resources that that Australian coastguard needs. If the Liberal and National parties had adopted Labor's view about a coastguard years ago when we advocated it we would now have extra patrol boats on the water actually apprehending these illegal vesselsnot taking their fishing nets and slapping them on the wrist and sending them away but actually apprehending the vessels. The boats would be there if the government had done what Labor said four years ago. Even at the last election Labor made clear its ongoing commitment to the creation of a coastguard. At the last election we committed to the acquisition of eight new vessels, three new helicopters and another 250 personnel. That is what is going to make a difference. That is what is going to determine whether this law is ever used. It is all good and well for the parliament to pass laws about punishing those involved in illegal activities. If you do not actually have on the ground the practical measures to catch them, this law will not be doing much at all. The practical measures are a homeland security department and a coastguard. Labor is committed to both. It is about time the government recognised the necessity of that, swallowed its pride and conceded that in 2002 it got it wrong and in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 it has got it wrong. It needs to now accept the need for a coordinated homeland security department and actually put some real resources into funding an Australian coastguard and not the mickey mouse changes that the Treasurer announced, catching 400 boats a year instead of 200 and still letting 12,600 go. That is not a solution. The people in Northern Australia understand that. It is about time the Howard government did too.",131
286,Mr SNOWDON,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"Lingiari) (6.10 pm)just As my colleagues have observed, the government seems absolutely disinterested in the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006, at least insofar as the backbench members of the government. I wonder what that says about them, frankly. I wonder why the member for Leichardt has chosen not to speak on this legislation, I wonder why the member for Solomon has chosen not to speak on this legislation and I wonder why the member for Kalgoorlie has chosen not to speak on this legislation. After all, whilst the member for Solomon's electorate does not have any coastal water-that is all in my electoratehe is always someone who seems to opine on every other issue to do with Northern Australia, regardless of whether or not it has got anything to do with his electorate; yet he is nowhere to be seen on this piece of legislation. We do not see the member for Kalgoorlie, who has a huge coastline and has had large numbers of foreign incursions in terms of foreign fishing vessels caught off the Western Australian coast. We know the member for Leichardt has a great deal of knowledge about Cape York and the gulf, but again he is not here to advocate the government's position on this legislation either. I wonder why that is. I commend the member for O'Connor, who did have the foresight to get up and make a contribution and, from what I heard of it, in parts a very worthy contribution-and I would not say that often about the member for O'Connor's contributions. This bill will provide for the first time deism. tention and fines as penalties for people caught fishing illegally between three and 12 nautical miles from Australia. These, of course, are the waters in Australia's fishing zone between the state and territory jurisdictional boundaries and the 12-mile limit of the federal boundary. Given the scale of the problem of illegal foreign fishing in Australia's northern waters, this is only a tiny tribution to fighting the problem of illegal fishing. What it does do-and I note the contributions from my colleagues on this side of the chamber-is highlight the government's abysmal failure to properly police Australia's northern coastline and to deter foreign fishers from illegally plundering fish stocks. It is not-as I have had cause to talk about it in this chamber on a number of different occasions-as if these foreign fishers are just swanning around Australia's northern waters, throwing their nets or lines out, taking the catch and then nicking off. That is not the case at all. What we know to be the case is that foreign fishers are using Australian shores, landing their vessels and in some cases setting up caches of food and even going so far as sinking wells for fresh water. We know from observations made by Indigenous rangers and by Customs, Quarantine and, indeed, Defence that they are using sites across the coastline to deposit their catch, principally shark fin. We know from observations made on Groote Eylandt that they actually use the land to deal with the catch. We know from observations made by other Indigenous people across Northern Australia that these people may spend some considerable amount of time on Australian soil. Not only does foreign fishing raise major problems and concerns for us but clearly quarantine issues are of great importance to us all and, potentially, defence issues which go to the heart of the so-called war on terrorWe have heard a lot said by the government over the years since 2001 about the need to protect Australia's borders. What they have demonstrated by their lacklustre performance and failure in the area of prevention, detention and deterrence of foreign fishing vessels is how porous Australia's northern borders are. It is almost as if any con- Tom, Dick and Harry could get in a canoe or an outboard and just make landfall. That is about the sum of it.  drugs in?",136
287,Mr SNOWDON,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"As my friend has pointed out: what else could they be bringing in? They could be bringing all sorts of contraband onto Australian soil. We do not know. Hypothetically, we do not know whether they have not deposited a sleeper somewhere in the Australian population as the result of landing on Australia's northern shores. We do not know that, but surely it is possible. The Australian community would be wise to remember the breast-beating that goes on on behalf of the government in its ability to protect Australian borders when they contemplate these salient facts. Even if you assume-and I do not-that these proposals will make a substantial change to the way in which we are able to apprehend foreign fishers, the deterrent value of the offences proposed in this bill are indeed very questionable. It is an economic proposition for impoverished Indonesian fishermen to return again and again to Australia despite the threat of being caught and losing vessels. I ask: will a prison sentence make a difference? Already we know that many of the fishermen are making multiple visits to Australia. There was notably one who was finally caught in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. He had not made his first, second, third or fourth visit. He had not made even his 10th, 20th, 50th, 60th or 100th visit. This person, before being caught, had made 103 voyages to Australia. What does that tell us? If you are an Indonesian fisherman, you would say, ‘Mate, what are the odds of being caught here?' We also know that there is an economic imperative, apart from the fact that the fishermen, on just the odds, are not going to be caught in the first instance. We also know that the economic imperative driving this, at least so far as the Indonesian fishers are cerned, is the fact that the Chinese fishing fleets have overfished and denuded Indonesia's own waters. So the economic value of the catch has increased as a result of the depletion of fish stocks in Indonesia. The opportunity-it is clearly not a challenge-for these Indonesian fishers is to say: ‘Hang on, we've got no fish stocks. We know that there is a real and ready market, a profitable market, for these fish we might catch illegally in Australian waters. Let's give it a punt; let's have a go.' Of course we now know from the observations made by Customs, Quarantine and indeed the Australian defence forces as well as others, such as the Australian fishing industry-commercial and recreational-that we are now getting these mother ships coming to Australia, freezer vessels carrying large stocks of illegally caught fish. ",137
288,Mr SNOWDON,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"Like the Chen Long. You wonder, in those circumstances, why it is that the government pretends that this piece of legislation is going to make a material difference. I go back to the point about the potential for profit at very little risk by these illegal fishers. I recall the member for Chisholm's mention of Dr Jim Fox, from ANU, who said: ... poor Indonesian fishermen will not easily be turned away from the lucrative shark fin trade because they receive exorbitant prices in China for their catch. I know Professor Fox. If anyone knows this subject as to what is happening in Indonesia, it is him. He went on to say: ... the level of over-fishing in Indonesian waters by Chinese crews is so great that Indonesians are being forced to fish in Australian waters. We know that to be the case. As I said, one fisherman caught in Arnhem Land had made 103 trips prior to being caught. Of the 4,122 recorded sightings-those are just the recon- corded sightings-of foreign fishing vessels in the Australian fishing zone between January 2004 and January 2005, how many do you think were actually apprehended-one per cent, 10 per cent or 15 per cent? You would hope so, wouldn't you? No, less than 0.25 per cent were apprehended. We have a problem of huge magnitude here which we all acknowledge, but I am not certain that prison sentences and fines should be the front line of our response. In estimates last week, the Managing Director of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, Mr Richard MCLoughlin, told the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee: There are many more vessels apprehended outside the threeto 12-mile zone than are apprehended inside of it. Of course, as a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, we cannot impose custodial penalties on illegal fishers beyond the 12 nautical mile zone. However, it is interesting to note that Coastwatch reports that in 2005 there were more than 13,000 sightings fishermen.",138
289,Mr SNOWDON,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"There were 78,000 illegal fishermen and 13,000 sightings of possible illegal fishing vessels operating beyond this 12-mile mark. We know, for the reasons I pointed out earlier, that the number of illegal fishing vessels coming to Australia's northern coastline is growing at an ever increasing rate. This bill is, in my view, an admission of failure by the government-and it is there in the budget for all to see. We note that $320 million was provided for in the budget to address this issue, but what is the money being used for? $47.9 million is for quarantine risk management and boat destruction. Once we have caught the small number of vessels we are able to apprehend, we will go out and destroy them. There is $16.5 million in capital expenses as an after-catch expense; $70.3 million for the transfer of apprehended fishermen to Darwin; $18.5 million for charting and surveying northern waters, which includes the Torres Strait and Barrier Reef but not the places where illegal fishermen are coming into Australian waters; $49.6 million for detention services for immigration; another catch expense of $2.7 million over two years for improved office space for the Joint Offshore Protection Command headquarters; and a further $20-odd million for office space for other relevant agencies. What are the preventative measures? On the assertive side, we have had another $34 million for increased aerial surveillance for Customs and Coastwatch. Without denigrating the professionalism and commitment of the crews involved, this has proved to be of little use against Indonesian fishermen. There is another $31.7 million for the use of the Southern Ocean patrol vessel in northern waters, which of course must leave the patagonian toothfish fleets from Russia applauding. Who is doing the job of patrolling them? It is an admission of failure. Of course, the minister proudly boasts that we will be able to double the apprehension rate as a result of these budget measures. Will it double? That is pretty good. It will go from 0.25 percent to 0.5 per cent. It makes you wonder, doesn't it? How could you boast that you are doubling something which is almost infinitesimally small? We know that if this were an Aboriginal organisation-and I am aware of many Aboriginal organisations-and they had put in this sort of performance, they would be defunded. That is the truth of it. ",139
290,Mr SNOWDON,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"That is right. We know that, on the funding for the Aboriginal ranger program for Indigenous engagement, the Northern Territory government did not ask for a large amount of money but suggested in a program submission from Kon Vatskalis, who is the Minister for Primary Industry and Fisheries, that they could do with $12 million. If they got $12 million they could employ a significant number of people across the Northern Territory to act as eyes and ears. He said in a press release on 5 January: It will provide more jobs ... with the creation of 29 full-time and 14 part-time positions for Indigenous people living in remote areas of the Territory. We know we have $12 million; that is for the whole coastline. There is 10,000 kilometres of coastline in the Northern Territory alone. Leave aside the Cape York area, the Eastern Cape, the Pilbara and the Kimberley coastthey are not included in that assessmentand $12 million over four years is all that is being provided for Indigenous engagement to assist the Commonwealth in doing the work of observing and then potentially apprehending foreign fishers. My friend the member for Brisbane has already spoken about the use of defence resources in this effort. I want to emphasise that, if we are fair dinkum about preventing and apprehending illegal fishers and being far more successful, we need to use all of the resources available to us. Frankly, that is what this bill will do. Not only are the budget measures for Indigenous rangers insufficient but also it has yet to be learnt they in fact hope to expend them. What we were hoping is that they would engage Indigenous rangers across the coastline and provide them with some resources and training so that they could operate effectively coordinated fashion with AFMA, Quarantine, Customs and indeed the Australian Defence Force. That appears not to be the case. We have largely chosen not to provide these community members with much needed employment. Nor have we used their intelligence about their country and their seas. That is a grave disappointment. As the member for Brisbane said, not only do we need our eyes and ears on the land-and I mentioned earlier the issue of people making landfallbut also we need to have a far more extensive deployment at sea. Belatedly, I have come to the view that Coastwatch is the only answer. That is not to say that the Australian Defence Force personnel who are involved in the current mission do not do a good jobthey do-but they are severely under-resourced, as are the Customs people and the Coastwatch people generally. Labor will support this legislation, but I think it is flawed and the government will not do anything of great substance as a result of it.  privilege to follow the honourable member for Lingiari in this debate. I want record my appreciation of the efforts of the honourable member for Lingiari and Senator Crossin, from the Northern Territory, who arranged for me and other colleagues on the maritime task force to meet a range of people in Darwin who are concerned about illegal fishing, including the Northern Territory Minister for Primary Industry and Fisheries and his officers. They also arranged for us to not go out to Maningrida to meet the Indigenous community there so we could listen to and share their concerns about the current situahow tion. I do thank the honourable member for Lingiari. My understanding of the problem has been increased immeasurably. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006 amends in a the Fisheries Management Act 1991, the FMA, and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984, the TSFA, to provide for increased fines and custodial sentences of up to three years imprisonment for persons caught fishing illegally in those parts of Australia's territorial sea that are subject to Commonwealth fisheries jurisdiction. Currently there are custodial penalties in both acts but they generally apply only to non-fishing offences such as obstruction and providing false information. The new penalties will apply to fault based indictable offences and not to the strict liability offences. The area covered by this legislation is a zone beyond the three nautical mile state and territory jurisdictional limit and the 12 nautical mile federal jurisdictional limit. Australia's exclusive economic zone, which extends from 12 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles, has been excluded from these new penalties because Australia is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and, as such, is prohibited from imposing custodial penalties on foreign fishing offences beyond the 12 nautical miles to place on territorial sea limit. As the honourable member for Lingiari and other speakers on this side have indicated, Labor supports this bill. It is a step forward but it is a minuscule one. I am very pleased to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, the member for Flinders, at the table for this reason: when I was speaking on the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Cooperative Fisheries Arrangements and Other Matters) Bill 2005 [2006] the honourable member for Flinders sought to intervene and asked me a question. I was happy to take it. He said to me: I ask whether the member for Chifley endorses the agreement that the foreign minister has just come back with from Jakarta this very day in relation to joint cooperation between the ies and joint cooperation between the two countries. In other words, there was an agreement for joint patrols between Indonesia and Australia. Parliamentary Secretary, where is that at? Why have we no projections in the budget about the effectiveness of these joint patrols? Why can't we be told-if not me, the people of Australia-when they will commence? How many vessels will be involved? Will we use the now unmothballed minehunters-the slowest of any naval ship; a vessel completely unsuitable for this task because of its slowness-as a joint patrol? Whilst I would welcome joint patrols by Indonesia and Australia, I think the parliamentary secretary knows, as I know, that that is years away and it is no solution. The honourable member for Lingiari mentioned that in 2005 there were more than 13,000 sightings of possible illegal foreign fishers operating within Australia's fishing zone. I will repeat that: 13,000. Ms George-It is shocking.  conservative estimate, that means some 78,000 illegal fishermen are coming here and fishing illegally. We, as the opposition, and the people of Australia-particularly Northern Australia-are supposed to congratulate this government because it wants to intercept some 4.62 per cent of the boats that are coming here illegally. We are supposed to congratulate the government because in 2005 there were 78,000 illegal fishermen coming here and now, as a result of this magnificent budget, there will be only 74,300 coming here-and that this is some huge improvement on the situation. These illegal fishermen are violating our sovereign territory, and it is an absolute disgrace. It is true that our defence forces are very stretched. I will have an opportunity to talk militarabout the redeployment of troops to East Timor, the additional troops that have already been redeployed to Iraq and the redeployment of troops to Afghanistan. I have nothing but admiration for our defence forces, particularly the serving men and women in those forces who do us so proud. But this is a responsibility that they cannot currently manage, and I cannot see any prospect in the near future that they will have any increased capacity to manage it. Again, as the member for Brisbane, the shadow minister for homeland security, has pointed out, deploying minehunters is singularly inappropriate. Let us understand the character of the problem. Firstly, the government have what I and people in Northern Australia call a ‘catch, kiss and release' policy. When they catch these vessels-and these are vessels that are catching our sharks and fish, raiding our reefs for trochus shells-they confiscate their equipment, the least expensive element on those boats, let them go free and say: ‘You naughty boys. Bye-bye; don't you dare do it again.' And, as the member for Lingiari has pointed out, one person has recently been caught who has made 103 trips to this country-has violated our sovereignty 103 times-and the government just do not care. They do not see it as a problem. It is a monumental problem. The honourable member for Lingiari knows that only too well when talking about quarantine problems. The black stripe mussel infested Darwin Harbour. It cost $3 million just to rectify that problem. These vessels landing on our coast. It is not as though they are being intercepted at sea or within the three-mile limit-they are landing. I will tell the House how these vessels operate as they get close to the coastline. They go up the tidal streams-which are largely unchartedwhere our naval boats are not permitted to go. There are so many areas on our northern borders and the coast of Western Australia that are uncharted. They go up those tidal streams and they get into the mangroves. They stay there during the day, then they do their fishing at night. I put a question on the Notice Paper: ‘How do you detect these 13,000 illegal fishing boats-wooden vessels-when they come at night-time? The government do not say, ‘We've got coastal surveillance.' They say, ‘We have aeroplanes up there and at night-time they can pick them up.' They cannot. Our normal radar and other detection devices will not pick up wood. So the very basis of the way we are operating allows these 78,000 illegal fishermen to remain undetected. We are outraged on this side of the House about the problem. I notice the honourable member for Kennedy is in the chamber. He will be concerned about the pearling industry. Australia has the last wildlife pearling industry and it is performing superbly over in Western Australia. What will happen if it gets an infestation of black stripe mussel or any other matter brought in by these illegal fishers? It will be wiped out. We will not only wipe out something of great economic value and beauty in Australia, which provides for the livelihoods of many Australians, but we will wipe it out for the world, and this government does not seem to care. On these boats they have chickens and birds. The biggest threat to Australia from avian flu comes from these 13,000 illegal are fishing boats that are landing-not all of them but heaps of them-on our coast in uncharted waters where the Navy is not permitted to go. You cannot send a patrol boat up tidal creeks and rivers-that is where these vessels hide, that is where they camp and that is where they eat-because they cannot get there, nor can the minehunters. We all know that these illegal fishermen are getting on our reefs. They are taking trochus shells. Not only are they taking sized trochus shells but also they are taking all trochus shells and any other shells on the reef. The Aboriginal communities that are spending their own money to reseed these reefs get not one dollar out of the environmental budget for the work they are doing, and shame on you, Parliamentary Secretary, and your government, for that. But what are we supposed to do-land a minehunter on top of the reef and blow it up and then ensure that the Indonesians cannot rip the reefs bare? Is this the operational theology behind having minehunters? You are grossly deceiving the people of Northern Australia and you are not doing enough. We have a significant problem. The only solution is not to place greater burdens on our already stretched defence forces who are performing so magnificently, but we do need a separate coastguard. The people of Australia were outraged when the Chen Long was discovered-a Chinese mother ship with a huge amount of fish on board. What did the government do? It spent $348,000 of taxpayers' money on the detention of Chen Long, ensuring that the refrigeration system did not collapse and that the 630 tonnes of reef fish found inside was not spoilt. Then what did we do with the Chen Long? We said: ‘Bye-bye. Take that valuable 630 tonnes of cargo and off you go.' Now we have had another Chinese mother ship discovered in our northern waters. What are we going to do? Are we going to spend half a million dollars preserving that cargo and then say, ‘Bye bye, ta-ta, it doesn't matter'? When the state fisheries departments have to close down fisheries because of the way they are being pillaged by these 78,000 illegal fishermen, I think it is a disgrace. dinary Australian fishermen who want to have a sustainable, long-term viable industry are being punished when they are doing the right thing. I say to the government: why won't you stand up for Australian fishermen? Why won't you stand up for the people of Northern Australia? Why won't you do something to seriously tackle this absolute breach of our sovereignty? Well might the parliamentary secretary at the table smile, because, if there were this many illegal fishermen being sighted off Melbourne or Sydney, it would be a matter of utter outrage. The saddest and most distressing thing I find is that, when you speak to the people of Northern Australia-whether in Queensland, the Northern Territory or Western Australia-they think that the people of the eastern coast of Australia do not care. I just want to finish on this note: these legal shark boats usually trail twoor threekilometre long-lines. I ask the parliamentary secretary: do you know what bait they are using? They are catching dolphins and cutting them up and using them as bait. You will often find that these fishing boats have a harpoon at the front. It is to catch and kill dolphins. Mr Deputy Speaker, can you imagine how much dolphin bait goes on one longline of three kilometres? I have seen these long-lines at Maningrida. The hooks are very long and very sturdy, and at about every metre there is another hook. Maybe I have got that wrong; maybe it is a bit more than a metre. But that is a lot of dolphins. And I think that people in Melbourne, in Sydney, in my electorate, in the electorate of Throsby and even in the electorate of Flinders would be very upset when they learn that this government is doing nothing to stop the slaughter of Australian dolphins in our northern waters, which are being used by these shark boats to catch sharks. If you like sharks-and I am Or- not a great fan of sharks-they are being caught at such a rate that there is real concern about the ecosystem that sharks form a vital part of. Whilst the opposition is supporting this bill, we believe that there is a problem in Northern Australia that requires a concerted, multidisciplined, multidepartmental approach. Just embedding in the Department of Defence a new unit for better cooperation will not provide the manpower, the resources or the vessels. Yes, I do support diplomatic efforts, but do not come back here trumpeting that a joint patrol between Indonesia and Australia is going to solve the problem when you know that any patrol is some years away and may in fact never happen. If you are so confident about how joint patrols are going to nip this problem in the bud, just share with us, in summing up this bill, when they are ilgoing to commence; how many Australian vessels will be involved; whether they will be patrol boats, minehunters-or destroyers, for goodness sake; what the Indonesian component will be; how many vessels they will be putting into these joint patrols; and how long they will patrol for and in what the area. You cannot fool the people of Northern Australia. They know they have a major problem and they want much more action(Time expired)",139
291,Mr KATTER,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"I would like to commence by thanking Gary Ward and the fishermen of Karumba who were instrumental in securing 60 Minutes, and I would like to thank 60 Minutes staff on the wonderful expose they did on the appalling failure of the federal government. I am very much in sympathy with the opposition on the issue of a coastguard service, but I am not in agreement with the opposition on how to go about it. I always feel that I am a minority of one here on the issue of defence. I do not know whether that is a northern perspective, because we were to be handed over to the Japanese in the last war-we that were north of the infamous Brisbane Line were to be sacrificed. I have news for the Western Australians, because the Brisbane Line included them. The Brisbane Line actually only recommended the defence of the golden boomerang from Brisbane through Sydney and Melbourne and around to Adelaide. The rest of it could not be defended, to quote General Mackay. Gary Ward and other fishermen at Karumba have been saying for ages that these people have been coming in. I needed something substantial to go forward with and we could not get people to come forward with photographs or anything of that nature, but 60 Minutes were alerted by the fishermen at Karumba and other people and they came in and exposed fully and completely exactly what was going on. If ever one has seen an absolute farce, it was this Australian boatand I think the poor old commander of that patrol boat is probably rowing a patrol boat out at Boulia or Bedourie at the present moment for allowing 60 Minutes on the boat. But they assailed this Indonesian fishing vessel and they called out in English for it heave to, that they were in Australian waters. The Indonesian vessel gave the Indonesian equivalent of two to the valley and took off. So they again hailed them on the loudspeaker-in English, and none of them spoke English-and they just kept taking off. Then they put out a rubber dinghy as a boarding party. This Indonesian boat had sharp poles that were poking off, and if the dinghy got close, of course, they would have punctured a hole in the dinghy. They kept going and eventually crossed into international waters, again waving the Indonesian equivalent of the two-up signal to the Australians. Anything more farcical would be hard to imagine. I want the House to know what exactly takes place here. Most of these sightings are not by Coastwatch at all. In fact, I suspect very few of the sightings are by Coastwatch. They are by fishermen. But whether it is fishermen or whether it is the Coastwatch aeroplanes that fly over, they then communicate back to the Coastwatch base, which is in Brisbane or somewhere down south where people have no understanding of what actually takes place in North Queensland or how North Queensland works-but, anyway, that is the way it works. They then contact a patrol boat in Cairns or in Darwin, and sometimes they have some of these new boats which are available to Customs, Quarantine and Coastwatch. These boats are not equipped with armament or anything of that nature. They are just a big fast boat. They have a very big draught, so they cannot go into any shallow waters, and the area near and dear to my heart, of course, is the Great Barrier Reef and its surrounding waters and also the Gulf of Carpentaria, where my own family comes from. There is so much shallow water in those places that a small typical dory fishing vessel out of Indoto nesia can go in any of these places and none of these boats that are sent out to assail them can. In addition to that, they simply wait for nightfall. Also, as the previous speaker, the member for Chifley, pointed out, these are wooden vessels, so they cannot be sighted by radar at night-not that sighting by radar is a very efficient method of picking up boats of an evening. They simply slip away into international waters. In the days not so very long ago territorial waters went to 23 kilometres out. Why 23 kilometres was chosen was that that was the range of a cannon. The concept was that you could control the waters the distance that you could fire a cannon over. That is pretty effecliving tive today. You own what you can control. In the most disgusting and appalling piece of insensitivity and stupidity, this government has limited the number of our fishermen to 6,000. That is all that are licensed between the five-kilometre and 200-kilometre distance. Only 6,000 Australian fishermen are allowed into our waters, but we find out now that in 2004 we sighted 9,639 foreign fishing vessels-and we do not sight all of those that come here. So we authorise 6,000 Australians to go in the water but we allow 9,639 foreign fishing vessels to fish in our water. That is bad enough, but in 2005 that had leapt up to 13,018. My problem here is that we do not have anything that remotely resembles an efficient system for picking these people up, because the patrol boats are only based at Darwin and Cairns. For those people who are ignorant of seagoing, you cannot really average a speed of more than about 15 or, at the very most, 20 knots. So you are going at about 30 kilometres an hour, and for those who do not know their geography it is about 1,000 kilometres from Cairns up to the Torres Strait, where you can turn west and then come back down into the Gulf of Carpentaria. So, if you are waiting for a boat to arrive from Cairns, think we can all rest assured that the Indonesians will long since have gone by the time it arrives. Night falls in the meantimeprobably twice before the patrol boat gets there-and of course no-one knows where they are. They have gone; they have vanished. If you ask what should be happening here, the first thing you need is for boats to be properly based at Karumba permanently. I am not saying that they should live there permanently, but you can have a crew there and they can be rotated out to Darwin or to Cairns. They are hardly in a position to be at Cairns, one of the great tourist destinations of the world. But you cannot base boats of any size or capacity at Karumba because it is not a proper port. It is made for small fishing vessels and we have enormous difficulty getting boats to take even 1,000 head of cattle on them-and that is a very small boat-up the river at Karumba. It does not take a lot of time, money or effort to build a port in the gulf. At the very most you are probably looking at about $25 million to build an adequate port that can house two, three or four patrol boats. If you are saying we should adequately patrol with these boats, then you are going to need a lot of boats. The coastline of Australia is greater than that of any other nation on earth, with the exception of Canada and Russia but there is hardly any necessity for them to patrol their northern coastlines, being all ice running to the North Pole. But that is not so in Australia's case. In 10 years time our two nearest nations, the Philippines and Indonesia, will have a combined population of around 300 million and a lot of those people, probably a third or possibly as many as a half, will go to bed hungry each evening. If you are going to attempt to deprive people who are hungry of I this fishery then they are going to get pretty mad. Say we as Australians envisaged the people of Arnhem Land deciding to have a vote on whether they should secede from Australia. Say they invited the Indonesian army to come in and oversee the elections with the blessing of the world body, the United Nations, who came in and oversaw the decision by the people at the ballot box. If the people decided to secede from Australia and the Indonesians stayed to see that the independence of these people was respected, I think a lot of Australians would be pretty mad. If you put your feet in the shoes of the Indonesians-and a lot of them do not have shoes-you will see that they have a very good reason to be seriously antagonised by us. As a result of this legislation we are going to have a lot of photographs in the Indonesian press of people going to jail in Australia for trying to catch some fish to feed their families, and the people up there are going to get pretty mad. I am not saying that we should not do these things, but I am pleading with the government not to go racing around the place forcing its own viewpoint upon other people, acting tough and generally having an extremely loud mouth. A person I admire greatly in history is Theodore Roosevelt, whose famous quotable quote was, ‘I speak softly but I carry a big stick.' Unfortuglos-as nately, the governments of Australia have had a very loud mouth indeed but we have no stick at all. What our stick amounts to is six frigates; that is what we have to protect Australia with. I do not know if people are familiar with naval warfare but in the Falklands War there were two British destroyers-not frigates; these were big vessels that you could pump a few bombs into and they would keep going. In the Second World War many of the destroyers took something like 40 or 50 hits and were still able to be operated. All that the Argentinians had were five Exocet missiles and two of those five missiles took out those two destroyers. So I leave it to your imagination how fast someone could deal with six frigates, and we are now going to spend what will be, ultimately-I do not think anyone is questioning this-the best part of $2,000 million on two destroyers. Those of us who had the pleasure of going along and listening to the missile boss from the United States noted he was asked about the danger and the threat of attack from a low-technology country. A few of us laughed and he said, ‘What would you consider to be a low-technology country?' A few of us laughed again and he said, ‘If you're thinking of Indonesia, they had contracted to buy the latest generation of Exocet missile.' One of those destroyers that went down in the Falklands had an interception capacity on it. But the Exocet is a very sophisticated piece of weaponry and it penetrated the interception system of the British Navy-and that was a mark 1 Exocet. He said the Indonesians had contracted to buy mark 3 Exocets and that, as luck would have it, their economy collapsed. If you want to read the book by Joseph Stiglitz, Globalisation, you will find the book mainly concentrates on what the International Monetary Fund, the Anfar as the Indonesians are concerned-did to their economy. When the dust had settled, instead of there being $1,800 in income per person, there was $1,000 in income per person. To put that into perspective, we have $19,000 in income per person and the Japanese have about $30,000 in income per person. This government seriously thinks that it can go on provoking its neighbour-with a population of 200 million and dominated by Java, a country that has a very strong history of colonialism and expansionism and very aggressive religious beliefs to go along with that-and then protect itself. I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage sitting at the table grinning. There was someone sitting in this place grinning in 1939 when people got up and said, ‘Hey, these Japanese could come down here,' but the people were told by the government of the day that we had a wonderful navy and a brilliant army and that the Japanese were a third-rate Asian power. I think there were 17 naval engagements between the Americans and the Japanese in the Second World War and the Japanese won every single one of the engagements with the exception of Midway. In the last engagement, the battle off Guam, the Americans lost 12 of their 13 vessels and the Japanese lost none. If you like to read your history books, read the three books on the Kokoda Trail and you will find that there were no American aeroplanes flying around Kokoda because most of them had been taken out of the sky by the Japanese at the time. But yet in this place we have the same smiling, grinning imbeciles, as the parliamentary secretary",144
292,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member for Kennedy will withdraw that.,147
293,Mr KATTER,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"I am not saying that he is an imbecile, Mr Deputy Speaker. I withdraw that. I am just saying that he is smiling and grinning. We had the same people in here smiling and grinning at that time. But, unfortunately for him, people write and read history books and they remember with very great bitterness the people who left our country open to the terrible invasion that was pending in 1942. It will cost $73 million to put a patrol out there with five guided missiles. It costs about a million dollars apiece for a cruise missile. The interception capability is very expensive, and I am told it runs to about $32 million. You need a helicopter with radar equipment so you can see a long way-and you might be talking about $1 million or $2 million there. So you have a figure of about $75 million. You would want 100 of those, and I dare say that is seriously what we need. If you are serious about denying our coast, our waters, to these people and you are serious about being able to defend our country, instead of throwing $2,000 million away on two destroyers when five Exocet missiles were able to take out two in the Falklands War, I would think that it would be infinitely more valuable to go down that path. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might say, ‘How do you finance this?' If we have a coastline of 15,000 kilometres or so to patrol, we are entitled to charge people a customs charge of 10 per cent on everything that comes into this country. That just might help some of our manufacturing and primary industries in this country to get back on their feet. One thing is for sure: if you are going to build 100 patrol boats over a 10-year period, you most certainly will become the leading small boat builder in the world. You will have great technologies in this country, and at long last you will return to having a serious technology availability in this country. So there are enormous side benefits to going down this particular pathway. If you do not control your own waters there will be problems. I have watched something like 2,000 North Queenslanders lose their livelihoods because of the actions of this government in protecting our fisheries from our Australian fishermen. It would be very nice if they protected our Australian fisheries from foreign fishermen instead of boat destroying the livelihoods of Australians. I put on record again that the parliamentary secretary at the table thinks that it is funny when 2,000 Australian families lose their livelihoods",147

304,Mr HUNT,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (7.10 pm)-In rising to sum up on behalf of the government the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006 I want to set out three principles that govern the Howard government's activities in relation to foreign fishing. First, we set out to destroy the practice of foreign fishing in Australia's northern waters, and we do that with an absolute ferocity of intent. Second, we do that through a clear commitment to destroy the boats and to destroy the livelihoods of those criminals who have no concern for Australia's territorial boundaries or our marine resources. Third, this bill as a part of that is about jailing offenders. Not only is it about jailing the ringleaders, the ship's captain or the organisers who are apprehended but also it carries the potential for penalising the full complement of the ship's crew, those who would seek to violate our territorial integrity, who would pillage our marine resources and who would put at risk our quarantine protections and our natural resources. We make no apologies for putting in place one of the toughest, if not the toughest, marine resource protection regimes in the world-the destruction of boats, the destruction of property, and jail not just for the ringleaders but also for the full complement of a ship's crew. This is a powerful regime designed to destroy in to to illegal fishing practices, whether they come from Indonesia or other parts of the Asia-Pacific region, and it does that backed by a $390 million package. It is not legislation that is unsupported. It is legislation with the full resources of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Australian government, designed precisely to eradicate the practice of illegal fishing in Australia's northern waters. It is wrong, it is unacceptable and we will not tolerate it. In addressing the statements made by various members of the House, and I appreciate all of those statements, I particularly want to run through three items: firstly, the problem; secondly, the overall package and the solution we take; and, thirdly, the particular elements of the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Bill 2006 and how they will increase jail penalties for illegal fishermen-whether they be organisers, ringleaders or ship captainswith the potential for doing so with the crew so that there is a clear and present threat and practice which can be used against anybody involved in illegal fishing. The problem is well known. Firstly, there is the pillaging of Australia's fishing resources, which has been brought to the attention of this House by the member for Solomon, the member for O'Connor, the member for Kalgoorlie, the member for Leichhardt and other members of the government over the past few months. They have been unrelenting as representatives of the northern regions in making the case that there is an issue here. We can see that there is a threat to our fishing resources. There is also a clear and present danger in our quarantine protection of Australia. Whether that danger be due to transportable diseases in the fishing industry, the pearling industry or ancillary marine and maritime industries, it is unacceptable. We take absolute responsibility for the quarantine task on our watch and we are dealing with it. I pay tribute to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Peter MCGauran, and in particular to the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, Senator Abetz, who in the few short months since his appointment has traversed the country not once but twice to win the support of the states and territories and to win from the Prime Minister and Treasurer an unprecedented budgetary package. I also thank the Treasurer, Peter Costello, and the Minister for Defence, Brendan Nelson, both of whom have been unstinting in their support of this issue. So what are the core elements of this package designed to eradicate once and for all the problem of illegal fishing in the north? There is a sea ranger program which draws from the Indigenous residents on the coast of Northern Australia. There is almost $7 million to assist these communities to assist the rest of Australia. It is good policy and a good marine protection measure. It is also great community development. The second element is the destruction of boats-and we will go to extraordinary measures here. If you are willing to encroach upon our waters, whether it be inside the 12 nautical mile zone or in the 12 to 200 nautical miles of our exclusive economic zone, we will catch and destroy your boat-your most valuable capital asset. That is a powerful disincentive and an appropriate punishment for the crimes carried out by these people who pillage our fishing resources. That is a critical step forward. All up, there is $390 million in funding. There is $11.7 million for joint offshore protection. There is $7.9 million for joint operations with Indonesia. The member for Chifley asked what we are doing with Indonesia. We are allocating $8 million to prevent and deter illegal fishing onshore as well as to carry out joint operations. There is $33.8 million to deal with the quarantine risks from illegal fishing. That includes $16 million for vessel disposal facilities in Broome, Darwin, Gove and the Torres Strait where these vessels will be destroyed. There is $1½ million for increasing officer training for Customs. Most significantly, there is $233 million for increasing the apprehension of illegal fishing vessels, whether it be between three and 12 nautical miles from our coast or between 12 and 200 nautical miles. That is at the heart of what we are doing. There is funding to deal with foreign fishing vessels on the Great Barrier Reef, particularly in response to the issues raised by the member for Kennedy, and $34 million to conduct aerial surveillance. All of this is backed up by another significant layer of funding across a range of activities. As I said at the outset, the fundamental purpose of this bill is to increase to two to three years the custodial sentences for those who violate our waters. We are talking about jail for fishing captains, jail for ringleaders and jail for the organisers of illegal fishing in Australian waters. We make no apology whatsoever for taking a measure which is fundamentally about border protection and protecting our marine resources. This measure is uncompromising in terms of jail sentences and it is backed by fines and the destruction of significant capital assets. That is what this bill is about. I accept and appreciate the views of all who have spoken, including members of the opposition, the member for O'Connor on the government side of the House and the member for Kennedy in his own world as an Independent. I thank all who have made a contribution. This is a strong package and it comes with bipartisan support. I thank the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, Senator Abetz, and all the other ministers who have supported the package. I thank the members for Solomon, O'Connor, Kalgoorlie and Leichhardt, who have fought for this package. There is funding of $390 million, legislation to jail offenders and a policy which is absolutely clear. We will destroy the practice of illegal fishing and we will not stop until we have achieved that aim. We will do that through the destruction of significant capital assets-the boats-and associated fines for those who breach our territorial boundaries. Through this legislation we will jail not just the ringleaders and the skippers but also the crew. We will be uncompromising in pursuing these goals. This is good legislation. It protects our borders and it protects our marine resources. I commend the bill to the House.",148
305,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Corio has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words.

306,Mr HUNT,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (7.22 pm)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. PLANT HEALTH AUSTRALIA (PLANT INDUSTRIES) FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 May, on motion by Mr MCGauran: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (7.23 pm)-The Plant Health Australia (Plant Industries) Funding Amendment Bill 2006 amends the Plant Health Australia (Plant Industries) Funding Act 2002. This is an important bill that provides a mechanism for plant industries to meet their commitments under the Australian emergency plant pest response deed. The emergency plant pest response deed is a landmark agreement between plant industries and the state, territory and federal governments that came into effect on 26 October 2005 after five years of sometimes difficult negotiations. The deed sets out formal funding and cost-sharing arrangements for dealing with an emergency plant pest outbreak such as occurred in the citrus industry at Emerald a few years ago. In practice, in an emergency it is expected that the Commonwealth would meet an industry's share of many of the up-front costs incurred as part of that response. The bill we are discussing provides a mechanism for an industry to repay the Commonwealth for liabilities incurred in this way. Plant industries may choose to set levies to accumulate funds in advance of any emergency or to only activate levy arrangements to deal with a particular disease outbreak. The legislation provides for the appropriation and application of the new emergency plant pest response levies and charges and authorises Plant Health Australia to hold and manage these funds on behalf of the industry. Plant Health Australia already holds and manages money raised through plant industry levies for other purposes such as research and development. There is also provision for industries to use money raised via these levies for other plants and related purposes if funds are available. All signatories to the deed have agreed to develop a program of plant pest risk reduction measures, including the development and maintenance of biosecurity plans and other measures. This is an important and positive step which will assist industries and governments to be better prepared to meet plant pest and disease emergencies. We saw in the case of the Emerald citrus canker outbreak the impact that an exotic plant pest can have on the incomes of growers and on others who earn their living in the citrus industry, as well as on the wider community. I believe this outbreak cost the Commonwealth some $13 million and, of course, over $100 million was lost in income to the local community. Citrus growers from a wide area of Queensland were prevented from accessing their normal markets for a considerable period, resulting in a significant loss of income for those farming families. There are many unanswered questions about the role of some individual growers in this outbreak and about the timeliness and the adequacy of the response by the federal government and its agencies. Indeed, the outbreak featured in a report put out in February 2006 by the New South Wales Farmers Association entitled Crisis of competence in quarantine. I am hoping that the report by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee that investigated the Emerald outbreak will throw some light on these matters. I understand that the report will be tabled in the next few weeks. I fear, however, that there will also be much about this incident that will always be shrouded in mystery. I congratulate all involved in negotiating the bill and the emergency plant pest response deed, especially the leaders of Australia's plant industries, for finally getting these arrangements in place. Australian plant industries contribute substantially to both the regional and the national economies. Because so many farm families and communities depend so much on these industries, it is important that governments ensure that adequate resources are in place to protect them from exotic pest and disease outbreaks. Australia trades in a global environment and often the standards that we set for our producers and processors are much higher than those set for competitive producers in other parts of the world. Australia has fought hard for decades to ensure its disease-free status as far as many international plant diseases are concerned. Despite our vigilance and best efforts, from time to time we suffer exotic disease outbreaks that take a heavy financial toll on producers, their families and their communities. I have already mentioned the Emerald outbreak. Another, of course, was the black sigatoka outbreak in the banana industry in the Tully region of Queensland, which at the end of the day cost in excess of $40 million to contain and clean up. Not only is protection an expensive business but so is the clean-up. It is pleasing to see these structures being put in place by government and industry as a sensible measure to plan for contingencies which may arise. Australian agriculture has been told it is facing future decades of substantial climate change which will be accompanied by changes in production and disease management environments. It is prudent for government and industry to thrash out arrangements for dealing with these changing circumstances-hence the provisions of this bill. Already the rural sector pays a significant amount to protect crops and agricultural production. Pests and diseases can cause enormous economic damage to the value of crop production, reducing crop yields, compromising quality and causing significant losses post-production in the storage phase as well. According to CropLife, the yields of farmers are increased by around 40 per cent as a result of the application of pesticides to control pests. Of course, if one is prepared to enlarge this debate, the farm sector is now well advanced in the application of physical and scientific technologies that are aimed at reducing plant diseases in the production phase. I mention here the genetically modified food debate. I will not go into detail in this debate. Suffice to say in the remaining time available to me that the opposition will be supporting this legislation. It is a sensible measure that involves the industry and government in providing a structure and, in the event of an outbreak, resources to ensure that we effectively meet a disease outbreak in our plant industries. Debate interrupted. NA",150
307,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Cunningham Electorate: Health Services",152
308,Ms BIRD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to address the House in the adjournment debate today to report on a very important issue in my local electorate and across the Illawarra region. On 2 May this year, just a few weeks ago, the local Illawarra Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association, led by Mrs Edna Stevenson, organised a health rally in Wollongong mall to canvass the many concerns that different groups in our area have about the declining delivery of health services and, to use their term, the Americanisation of our system of health funding. At the rally there were representatives of lobby groups concerned about issues such as the abject failure of dental health services since the Howard government scrapped the Commonwealth dental health scheme. Others were lobbying to get a Medicare licence for the state government provided MRI machine at Wollongong Hospital. Speakers talked about the problems of accessing many other medical services, as the health system struggles under the failure of the government to address medical workforce problems and the provision of services. My colleague the member for Throsby outlined to the gathering the various problems facing Commonwealth health provision and the frustration that, over many years now, the needs of the community have fallen on deaf ears within the Howard government and, in particular, those of the current Minister for Health and Ageing. I have presented to the health minister a petition of over 17,000 signatures from people living in the Illawarra region, asking for a Medicare licence to be allocated to the MRI machine at the Wollongong regional hospital. The member for Throsby and I have been fighting for this licence for over four years now. Wollongong Hospital is the major referral hospital for local specialists for our region. People who are being treated for ongoing and chronic, often life-threatening, illnesses are not in-patients of the hospital but need regular MRI scans to assist their specialist monitoring their condition. An example that was brought to my attention by a local person was the need to monitor the progress of a cancerous tumour. Often there may still be an income earner in the family and the patient may not be entitled to a health concession card. In this case-and many such cases have been brought to my attention by both patients and specialists in my electorate-the family has to regularly find the cost of the gap for a private scanner provider or, as has happened, the patient has to be admitted overnight to the hospital in order to access the hospital machine as an in-patient. This is a very inefficient use of hospital beds at this time and it is a problem. The government simply will not provide a licence for the hospital machine to allow outpatients to be bulk-billed for this service. There is joy in the recent budget on this issue, but we will continue to pursue the government for the provision of a Medicare licence for the Wollongong MRI machine. My colleague the member for Throsby has been working closely with the local dental health group on behalf of both our communities. The Howard government made one of the most short-term and illogical cost-saving decisions in its first year in government when it axed the Commonwealth dental health scheme. An excellent and very active dental health support group in the Illawarra has been bringing many dental and general health problems faced by local people to the attention of the local community. People have to wait ridiculous lengths of time for public dental treatment. This group have highlighted a disgraceful number of stories where people on pensions or income support have no option but to be on lengthy waiting lists for basic dental services. They have explained that other health in complications too often arise because of untreated dental health problems. Many of these associated health problems are very serious, particularly for those, for example, with a heart condition. In the recent budget, despite the significant income windfall the government had to spend, there was no joy for public dental patients. But again, I am confident that the Illawarra dental health group will not be letting up on the fight to have this service reinstated. I commend the local community activists who invited the member for Throsby and me to their rally earlier this month for maintaining their determination to fight for the dignity and rights of people who are very vulnerable and who rely on fair and affordable access to our health system. Despite this government's heartless deafness to their no pleas, they will never give up and will continue to lobby politicians, rally the community and keep these issues in the public eye. They are great battlers for our community. (Time expired) Mrs Edith Swaby",152
309,Mr FORREST,ADJOURNMENT,"One of the honours of being a member of this great chamber and one of the responsibilities that it brings is that you get to meet some really wonderful Australians. As the House adjourns tonight, I would like to bring to its attention one of those Australians: Mrs Edith Swaby, who is 108 years old today. I am very grateful for the interest that has been taken in her. Today she is featured on page 13 in the Victorian Herald Sun, in honour of her contribution over 108 years to the development of this great nation. I am also grateful to the journalist, Terry Brown, who has written a truly beautiful story about Edith Swaby. She was born on 31 May in 1898. It is worthwhile thinking about what was happening that far back. Terry Brown sets out clearly in the article that in 1898 the Victorian Football League had only started its second season. Grafter had won the Melbourne Cup. It was before the advent of crayons, tea bags, bandaids or, dare I say it, the brassiere. It was the year before the Boer War. And Carbine was alive and producing horses that went on to become great champions. I mention those facts because Mrs Swaby has seen so much in 108 years. It is a tremendous tribute to her to have reached the age of 108. Some assistance was sought from my office for tributes to be sent to her, but she organised her own birthday party at the age of 108. Without the assistance of an address book, she did all the invitations herself. She is very spritely for her age. I am looking forward to spending some time with her to discover the secret of her longevity. She did say to Terry Brown that she did not have a secret on how to beat time. She said: None whatever. Just keep on living. She is a delightful Australian. She has had three children, two sons and a daughter, and currently has around 50 grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She still enjoys playing the piano. Over a life of 108 years she lived with her husband in Donald, moved on from there to Horsham and currently resides in the Natimuk Nursing Home, a small community 15 minutes drive west of Horsham. She enjoys a wonderful lifestyle. She enjoys good fellowship with her coresidents at the Natimuk Nursing Home. It just proves how important the Commonwealth's investment is in aged care through those isolated regions that people like Mrs Swaby can enjoy a prosperous and productive sunset of their life. I remember her 100th birthday, and here she is at the sprightly age of 108 going on from strength to strength. I would like to pay her a wonderful tribute. I am hoping that she can keep on keeping on. Her contribution to the prosperity that subsequent generations have now enjoyed in this great nation is valued and appreciated. It is important that the federal chamber recognises her contribution and the contribution of so many like her. It is interesting to realise that the number of centenarians in my constituency is growing enormously. It just proves the point again of the advantage of providing good aged care support to people who have earned the right to enjoy their sunset years. Her husband came home wounded from the First World War but made a good go of it farming in the Donald region. It is sad that she lost him many years ago, as far back as 1968, but she has gone on to enjoy her children and grandchildren. The Nutimuk community today has celebrated greatly with Mrs Swaby. I join her, although geographically distant, and hope her day has been wonderful and enjoyable with her friends and relatives. I wish her even greater longevity. South Melbourne Centrelink Office",153
310,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT,"The future of the South Melbourne Centrelink office, the only Centrelink office in my electorate of Melbourne Ports, is a matter of abiding concern to me. Some people at the eastern end of the electorate are served by the Windsor Centrelink office, but that is in the seat of Higgins. The South Melbourne office serves the people of Port Melbourne, South Melbourne, Albert Park, Middle Park and West St Kilda-something in the order of 20,000 people. The area served by this office has a high level of need for Centrelink services. It includes many elderly people, tenants in public housing and recent migrants, particularly people from the former Soviet Union, many of whom do not speak good English. Many of these residents travel by public transport. In 2001 the area served by South Melbourne included 5,600 disability pensioners, 5,500 age pensioners, 2,200 family pensioners and 1,500 job seekers. Those figures have only slightly decreased. It is a small office compared to other Centrelink offices, but it is a vital office. In 2001 the then Minister for Family and Community Services, Larry Anthony, tried to close this office down and force everyone in the western end of my electorate to travel to Windsor to access Centrelink services. This caused an enormous community protest led by clergy and church community workers from the South-Port-Parks Inter-Church Council, representing the Christian churches of South Melbourne, Port Melbourne, Albert Park and Middle Park. As a result of this protest and the prospect of a protest rally outside the Centrelink office, Mr Anthony, at a meeting with me, agreed either to find new premises for Centrelink or to keep the existing office open. It in the end kept the existing office open. This was a great victory for the local community. Five years later Centrelink's lease on its current premises is expiring and, as a result, many Centrelink clients fear that the service at South Melbourne is to be downgraded or closed. I have been told that staff are being rotated in and out of South Melbourne on a month-to-month basis, which would mean that clients have to deal with people they do not know and who have no familiarity with their cases. It would also mean that inexperienced staff are unable to build links with the community. This would certainly not be acceptable to the local community or to me. The arguments in favour of retaining a fully staffed and fully functional Centrelink office in South Melbourne are as strong now as they were in 2001. This is an area of high social need. I am particularly concerned about my migrant, elderly and disabled populationpeople living in poor health or with disabilities. They are familiar with the South Melbourne Centrelink office and can reach it easily. They are not familiar with Windsor and cannot reach it easily by public transport. The Windsor office is six kilometres east of South Melbourne. This may not seem far to members but, because of the radial structure of Melbourne's public transport system, this is a slow and difficult trip for Centrelink clients, particularly the elderly. It involves catching three trams. I have a great deal of respect for Centrelink staff and their dedication to their clients. Keith Stevens, Centrelink's regional manager, has assured me that he is working to provide better services for Centrelink clients at South Melbourne, and I do not doubt that that is true. The problem is not with Centrelink staff but with the continuing suspicion that the government wants to downgrade Centrelink services in electorates like mine. Yesterday I had a meeting with the Minister for Human Services, Mr Hockey, and his adviser. The minister assured me that, although the lease on its current premises is about to expire, the South Melbourne Centrelink service will not be closed and that it will continue to offer face-to-face services to clients. I, of course, accept the minister's word on this, but I will remain vigilant in the interests of Centrelink clients in South Melbourne. As Ronald Reagan used to say in relation to the Soviets, ‘Trust, but verify.' Dental Services Media Standards",154
311,Mr CAUSLEY,ADJOURNMENT,I will delay what I intended to speak about to reply to some comments made by the honourable member for Cunningham. I note that members of the Labor Party continue to peddle misinformation about the dental health scheme and try to say that it is a program of the federal government. Mr Danby-Should be.,156
312,Mr CAUSLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"‘Should be,' I hear over here now, so we have a changed position. Mr Danby-It was.",156
313,Mr CAUSLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"It never was. I was a member of the cabinet of the New South Wales government for seven years and I clearly understand the health agreement between the federal government and the states. It was part of our health program in New South Wales. Admittedly, there was a waiting list at the time. I clearly recall in the 1993 federal election when then Prime Minister Paul Keating looked like he was not going to win the election and in the last little while promised so many millions of dollars for so many procedures over a set period of time. That is the only involvement the federal government has ever had in the dental health scheme. This government completed the program that was promised by the Keating government and it then reverted back to the states. As treasuries often do, I noted in New South Wales, even though we were in government, treasuries diverted the state funds as soon as the federal funds arrived. As usual the cost shifting continued. I rose to talk about the media. I spoke in the debate last week about the standards of media reporting in Australia. It was brought to my attention early last week that standards are appalling, in this instance in the regional media. A week before I had been asked to represent the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, who is at the table, at an opening of an entertainment centre at Byron Bay. It was actually in the electorate of the member for Richmond but, of course, we all know that the Labor Party say that this is National Party boondoggling. So the minister quite rightly asked whether I would go along to open the entertainment centre. Obviously the member for Richmond did not approve of it because it was only a boondoggle. So I went along to open it and I duly did so. It was a pleasure to be there. There were 300 or 400 people there. The mayor of Byron Bay introduced me, in a sort of a way, to the assembled community, and it was quite a good evening. I congratulate the people who were involved. It was something like a $1.3 million investment to which the federal government made a contribution of $250,000. I think it will be a very good project. The member for Ballina, Don Page, was there as well. Imagine my surprise when I opened the Northern Star on Monday morning. The Northern Star is based in Lismore, New South Wales. The headline across, I think, the third page was, ‘High-flying mayor opens entertainment centre'. They even had a lovely photo of her on the trapeze. I remember the camera being there, so obviously they had it all lined up to get this photograph. They had the story written before the place was opened. I rang up the deputy editor of the Northern Star and said, ‘What's this story you've got on page 3 today?' He said, ‘That's the opening of the entertainment centre.' I said, ‘Yes, that's correct, but I opened it.' He said, ‘What?' I said, ‘I opened it.' He said, ‘I'll check on that.' He came back about half an hour later and said, ‘We got that information from a publicity agent.' I said, ‘That's okay, but the whole story is wrong.' Mr Speaker, do you know what he said to me? He said, ‘We can't be responsible for that.' Here is a paper that did not even check its facts. As I was saying last week about the media: they do not check their facts, they go to print, they publish stories that are obviously fiction and yet they will not bother to retract or even correct them. The newspaper still have not corrected that story. It would only take a little note to say, ‘We got it wrong; we ity. apologise.' But they have not retracted; the story remains. The local paper, the Byron Echo, which is not always on our side, did get it right. So we have two adjoining papers. One says that I opened the entertainment centre and the other says that the high-flying mayor opened the entertainment centre. I have to say to you, Mr Speaker, that if the journalists' code of ethics means anything then these people have to do their homework a lot better than they do. (Time expired) Reverse Mortgages",156
314,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Two of the previous speakers, the member for Mallee and the member for Melbourne Ports, referred to aspects of older Australia. Of course, that reflects in some degree the ageing demographic of our country. One of the realities is an increasing market for those companies that are less than altruistic, such as Macquarie Bank, St George, ABN AMRO et cetera, with their establishment and penetration of the reverse mortgage market. The truth is that people on fixed incomes will be hit harder by the change in taxation in this country with regard to indirect taxes through the GST. Historically, ownership of the family home for many generations has been the foundation on which families have built their economic security, in some cases acting as a guarantee for the children's spread into the home ownership market. Reduced access in this country to essential services such as health is another area where, increasingly, older people who need income see this new reverse mortgage market as attractive. The decline of services in the last decade or so has undermined that notion of security and now the family home is largely seen more as a social security safety net and less as a family asset which generations can rely on to build security and guarantee future prosperWith the ageing of the population, and more people keen to remain at home rather than go into residential nursing homes, there is once again a large and expanding market for such a concept-people needing income. That has been the background to the development of reverse mortgages. The Australian Consumers Association defines them as a way in which home owners aged 60 years and older can borrow money against the current value of their home and pay it back, including interest and fees, when they sell-or the estate can pay it back after their death. The advantages are pronounced. They allow a freeing up of money to maintain or increase people's living standards. The money can be used for going on holiday, urgent repairs to the home or the purchase of a car. It also allows people to keep their financial independence without having to sell their home and move into something smaller. The disadvantages essentially are far greater, especially if economic realities force people into these mortgages. A common feature is that there are expensive start-up payments of $1,000 to $3,000. Reverse mortgages can limit future access to funds if people wish to move closer to siblings or children or relocate to retirement villages, and they can significantly reduce capital. Research by the Australian Consumers Association shows that reverse mortgage contracts contain many clauses that limit individuals' rights-for example, many allow the lender to make a range of changes without the agreement of the borrower. To this end, borrowers should not leave anything blank in the contract. The Australian Consumers Association found a clause allowing the lender to fill in blanks on behalf of the home owner. There are also of course wide-ranging default clauses. When you are in default, the lender can stop payments if you are taking the loan as a regular income amount or even require immediate repayment of the whole loan. The person can be in default for minor contract breaches in the payment of council rates, gas, electricity et cetera. Reverse gages are targeted at elderly homeowners who will use the product until they die. It is foreseeable that at some point in the future the borrower could forget to pay a bill on time for council rates, strata fees, water or any other utility and so be in default. Problems can occur if you want to sell your home, especially if at that time the value of the loan is higher than the value of the house. Before the sale, a lender usually requires you to ask for its approval. It will usually do a valuation and check that you are selling the property on the open market and getting market value. The jargon for this is ‘an orderly arms-length sale'. Problems can occur if the original valuation shows the house was worth more than the sale price. In the larger and more established UK market, inadequate reverse mortgage contracts and poorly designed products have caused consumers to be evicted from their homes. Recent ACA research highlights grave concerns about the broad default clauses and limits to the no-negative equity guarantees in reverse mortgage contracts. Reverse mortgage contract traps have the potential to place elderly consumers in financial danger at a time when they may be frail and vulnerable. They now need to be cleaned up and made crystal clear to prevent excessive risks to borrowers in years to common.

315,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"I am pleased to rise in this place tonight to recognise and commend the government's decision to provide 120 medical school places to Deakin University's Waurn Ponds campus within the electorate of Corangamite. I also acknowledge, Mr mortSpeaker, your contribution and support in this particular project. The funding decision represents a colossal investment for Geelong and will break the Victorian monopoly on medical training held by the University of Melbourne and Monash University. The decision will make Deakin University Victoria's first rural and regional medical school. The establishment of a medical school at Deakin University will be important in attracting some of the best young minds to Geelong and will attract new health and educational sector investment to the Geelong region. I was pleased to be able to join Deakin University's Vice-Chancellor, Professor Sally Walker, together with Professor John Catford, Dean of Deakin University's Faculty of Health and Behavioural Sciences, at the official announcement by the Prime Minister of the medical school funding at the Liberal Party's Victorian State Council in April. I was delighted that the Prime Minister was kind enough to endorse my contribution and acknowledge my role in the government reaching this decision. In addition to the 120 medical school places, the Prime Minister announced a oneoff $18 million capital works grant to Deakin University, subject to matching funding from the Victorian government, to assist the university in establishing the required new facilities. Some of the new medical school places at Deakin University are expected to be available within two years. The Deakin University medical school announcement is part of the $250 million commitment by the Howard government over four years to train more doctors and nurses and includes the provision of 400 new medical school places per year across Australia. I commend the professional manner in which Vice-Chancellor Professor Sally Walker and Professor John Catford went about lobbying and arguing their case for the medical school places at Deakin. Deakin University spoke to everyone who had an important role in making this final decision. They consulted successfully with local members of parliament, not only me on the government side but also the member for Corio from the opposition. Deakin University also presented a strong case to Victorian Liberal senators. Importantly, Deakin University put together a very strong, well-constructed argument for providing new medical school places in regional Victoria. There is an undersupply of medical school places in Victoria and a shortage of doctors in country areas. The argument was put very strongly that Victoria should be the place in Australia where these doctors should be trained and that argument was won in the early part of this important debate. There is a good body of research to show that country people who have trained in a rural and regional environment are more likely, when qualified, to choose to live and practise in country towns. In this regard, Deakin was a natural choice Victoria for a regional medical school. To strengthen the case, Deakin University formed alliances with Geelong Hospital and with hospitals in Hamilton and Warrnambool in the electorate of Wannon, in which you, Mr Speaker, were very helpful. These alliances will strengthen the rural practice element in the medical training. I also note the good performance of the Deakin School of Nursing, which has produced graduates since 1985. I supported their proposals at that earlier time. As the local member, I was very pleased to put forward two very strongly worded written submissions to government ministers to support the Deakin University medical school proposal and I personally advocated the case with both the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Education, Science and Training. This major investment in the Deakin medical school demonstrates the Howard government's commitment to addressing the shortage of regional doctors not only in Geelong and western Victoria but Australia-wide. This is a wonderful outcome for the enthusiastic vice-chancellor, Professor Sally Walker, and her hard working team. I commend the proposal and-along with you, Mr Speaker. I am delighted that the Prime Minister and the government have supported such a magnificent proposal. Reverse Mortgages",158
316,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Existing laws, including the uniform consumer credit code, do not adequately protect reverse mortgage consumers and there is little protection provided by such alternatives as dispute resolution and clear disclosure requirements. Whilst there are obviously problems, they continue to proliferate. It is essential that consumers investigate alternatives and are extremely vigilant when signing up for these proposals. Fundamentally, of in course, there is a need for the government as a whole to look at the growth of this form of loan and ensure that an enough protection is provided to Australian consumers. Mrs Ivy Emma Sharp",159
317,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"I missed most of today's proceedings because I was at the funeral in Melbourne of Ivy Emma Sharp, who died last Friday two days short of 99 years and 11 months. I ask a little indulgence because she was my wife's grandmother. She is survived by two children, nine grandchildren and I think it is 19 great-grandchildren. One of them is a student at the School of Nursing at Deakin University. Ivy never really sought to be the matriarch of a clan that large, but she became the matriarch. She was a very caring person. I remember the way that she struck up a friendship with my dad not because he was a member of parliament, a local doctor and an ambassador but because he had had a school holiday job at MACRobertsons and Nan Sharp had worked at MACRobertsons. She was always looking for those special things. May she rest in peace.",160

367,Ms KING,MAIN COMMITTEE," Mr Deputy Speaker and I hope it is providing you with some respite for you! In debating the Appropriation Bill 07 budget, I want to focus on the Howard government's failure to address the key issues of infrastructure, to deal with crucial issues of child care and its force and their failure to lay down a future failure of policy ideas and government stagnation. The government has wasted an opportunity future economic prosperity. This budget is for invest in Australia's future and the interests the skills of our people. Education was not The government has failed to provide strong ing a piecemeal approach and investing in favoured tives and reward for effort into Australia's the workforce.

Leader of the Opposition-who sadly was on the this nation into debt. They will happily how we should be spending the surplus. Fortuto trust the Labor Party with the national purse to provide this budget, which provides benefits government's path of responsible economic mana legacy of a strong and growing economy. on yet another outstanding budget and I comScott, it is nice to see you in the chair from what must be something of a torrid time (No. 1) 2006-2007 and cognate bills for the 2006economic performance and how their investment and skill shortages, their failure contribution to assisting families into the workfoundation for economic growth reflect a broader in this budget to lay down the foundations for the short term. It is a budget that has failed to of the nation as a whole. It has failed to invest in mentioned once in the Treasurer's budget speech. national leadership on infrastructure, again takprojects, and it has failed to build incentax system-particularly for women returning to wondering what has actually happened. Here you of spending proposals, including some modest NA changes to the taxation system, yet in the public's fanfare, despite the Treasurer's hoopla, it has the result of $60 billion worth of spending have to be asking himself, ‘What's a guy got and we go backwards in the polls.' The Australian public is worried about the lia are particularly worried, because we can us and we can see what rising petrol prices crumbling infrastructure every day, and we downturn. That is why this budget has sunk like stand that what the Australian public, what those lia, were looking for in the budget was not rection-a vision and a plan to help us create vide for future prosperity.

The government's also true that our net foreign debt, already gone up 2½ times. It is now worth $500 billion-that trends, foreign debt will reach $1 trillion in 65 per cent. Australia's current account deficit is the prices. The government tries to argue that foreign nothing to do with the government and, by extension, omy. That is simply not true. As the IMF has mainly held by the private financial sector, shifts in market sentiment. It is our capacity sure that foreign debt places on interest rates placed on future generations to service foreign worried about it. Just as worrying is our trade deficit. The 49th monthly trade deficit in a row. That is been importing more than it exports for four eye it has sunk like a stone. Despite the sunk like a stone.

Child care is also an area that I want to talk for this government. The Treasurer, on budget new child-care places by 2009. Leaving aside government, in deciding to lift the cap on hours care places, has failed In those two types of child care there are care, for example, there are currently 67,000 there are currently 30,000 places unfilled. It organisations cannot recruit enough family hour, per child, it is little wonder. Added to tional subsidies to family day care schemes, workers, it is little wonder that it is hard Despite the fanfare in the budget, there care and out of school hours care places will the argument that the number of people now true. There are more people, particularly force-predominantly in casual work, trying increased costs of living. But, despite an overall child care, the shortfall in child-care places over a massive rise in child-care fees. The real winners out of child care in the sector. The government has opened up council of school hours care to competition from the for-profit massive shortfalls of long day care centre based that area of care where the major shortages for-profit child-care sector has increased the the scrapping of the operational subsidy by care centres has meant that many local council councils are seeking to divest themselves of child-care centres being built by the for-profit economic returns, which has left many areas, concentration of parents seeking As I said, it is the area of long day care solutely nothing in the budget to increase the alone to tackle the issues of affordability. In the hard work of local parents a number of tract enough private providers into the area care places.

Whilst the increase of participation for the number of long day care places available overall, the Howard government's community based childservices are no longer financially viable and their management. It has also resulted in new providers in areas where they can reap higher including rural and regional areas, with a high child care short of places. where the shortages are most acute.
