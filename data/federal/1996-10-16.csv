1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND NA ASSISTANCE) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 October, on motion by Mr Reith: That the bill be now read a second time.  way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) is of the opinion that the maintenance of a universally accessible system of government schools able to provide appropriate curriculum offerings comprehensive enough to meet the needs of the students enrolled is a national priority; (2) expresses grave concern at the damage likely to be done to government schools by the Government's mooted abolition of Commonwealth requirements for funding nongovernment schools, with the significant cost being offset by a reduction in Commonwealth direct grants to the government sector; (3) condemns the Government for refusing to meet its responsibilities in ensuring that a qUality education is accessible to every Australian child.""",13
2,Mr MCCLELLAND,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Barton) (9.31 a.m.)Despite opinions expressed in recent times by coalition members, including the Treasurer (Mr Costello), as to the appropriateness of the Commonwealth being involved in education, there is no doubt that the Australian public expects our national government to ensure the proper education of our youth. After all, it is literally an investment in our future. It is unquestionably the main factor which will determine the destiny of our nation. You get education right or you go under as a nation. Australians specifically approved federal involvement in education in 1946 by approving an amendment to the constitution to include section 51 (xxiiiA), which gives the Commonwealth the power to make laws with respect to the provision of benefits to students. In addition, section 96 of the constitution gives the federal parliament power in respect of the funding of states through tied grants. It is only in relatively recent times, however, that the Commonwealth government has become involved in the funding of education. The debate regarding Commonwealth funding became particularly heightened during the 1960s. During that time in particular, the extent of overcrowding in Catholic schools became public knowledge, as did the dilapidated state of buildings and the standard of teachers in those schools. There was a realisation that Catholic schools in particular had very much become an integral part of the mainstream education system, catering for nearly one-fifth of students. Given the size of the Catholic school system and the fact that the Catholic school system had catered for students from all socio-economic backgrounds for over a century, the argument became compelling that they should be assisted in undertaking the task of educating young Australians. Indeed, it was realised at that time that, if the Catholic schools released their students to the state system, it would have caused very real difficulties. The Commonwealth's first contribution to funding education was with the States Grants (Science Laboratories and Technical Training) Act 1964. But since the early 1970s the debate as to the appropriateness of state aid for non-government schools has become effectively a non-issue. All sectors have worked extremely effectively and cooperatively in the allocation of resources to educate our youth for the benefit of our nation. The current level of federal funding is such that we will be spending approximately $3.2 billion directly on schooling, with $1.8 billion going to non-government schools this year. The bulk of these funds will be paid as general recurrent grants, with $117 million going towards capital works funding. A significant part of the cooperation that has developed over the years since the early 1970s has been in the nature of long-term planning through the new schools policy, which has existed since 1985. In order to establish a new school, those applying had to satisfy specific planning criteria. State planning committees, including representatives of government and non-government school authorities, provided advice to the Commonwealth as to whether the applications satisfied those criteria. Those which failed to satisfy the criteria were ineligible for Commonwealth funding. It made sense that, in order to receive taxpayers' money, the applicant had to establish its viability and consistency with educational resources already allocated to the locality or the selection zone. Despite these requirements, the majority of applications succeeded. Some succeeded after consultations with other school authorities in the planning processes and mechanisms. In other words, those consultations assisted the applicants to get their acts together in order to get a school regime which was satisfactory and compatible with the rest of the state. By way of example, since 1985 about 95 per cent of applications from Catholic schools have satisfied the criteria. Have existing private schools suffered as a result of the new schools policy? The answer is clearly no, they have not. The non-government schools sector has grown substantially and has done so within a policy framework that promoted planning principles and procedures. In 1995 a review of the new schools policy was established and chaired by Professor Ken MCKinnon, a former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong and a former Chair of the Commonwealth Schools Commission. The committee reported in respect of the criteria which new schools should meet in order to be eligible for Commonwealth funding. Those criteria included, very sensibly, the need to establish that the approval of the application will not have a significant negative educational impact on existing government and non-government schools in the catchment area of the proposed school. One would consider that that criterion is essential. Another criterion was that the proposal promotes rational and economic use of educational resources in the area. Unfortunately, the government's bill is a totally irrational and nonsensical approach to the funding of education. Literally, those criteria of rationality and forward planning have been thrown out the window by this bill. The main action proposed by the bill is: . .. to the establishment and funding of nongovernment schools . . . The Bill abolishes the previous government's New Schools Policy from the beginning of 1997. This means that, from that time, those wishing to establish new schools will only have to satisfy minimum Statefferritory registration requirements. As well, theÂ· current policy that restricts new non-systemic schools to <;ategory 6 recurrent funding is to be removed. Under the new arrangements non-systemic schools will be able, if eligible, to access funding from the full range of categories. Again, that is eating into the overall education cake. The abolition of the new schools policy reflects a complete lack of understanding of the need for complex and long-term planning to cater for changes in birth rate, immigration and population movements. It will have the effect of requiring public schools and the students and teachers to adjust continually to the effects of decisions made by unregulated private schools in receipt of substantial public funding but with no corresponding public responsibility for planning as currently exists. The coalition has ignored the social responsibilities that should be attached to all schools drawing upon public funds. Access to the public purse should involve those responsibilities. The coalition's decision will ultimately promote disharmony between sectors and reopen the bitter and regrettably sectarian debate as to state aid for private schools. On the subject of choice of parents, as this government tends to have as its catch cry, the MCKinnon review said: Growing cooperation among those involved in schooling, both government and non-government and teachers and parents, is unlikely to continue if these cutbacks persuade interest groups to think it is necessary to fight for a better share of a shrinking pool of schooling resources. In other words, choice is choice at an expense. The expense is going to be the loss of cooperation and confrontation in respect of the diminishing school cake. For instance, it will mean that the cake has now to be spread, presumably, to include at least the 65 applications for new schools, which themselves plan to cater for 33,000 students. In other words, the funding blanket is going to be spread so thinly that it is itself going to be vulnerable to injustice and hardship, which will inevitably occur. Many existing private schools, and indeed public schools, will find that they will have to introduce more composite classes as a result of the drain of students. Many courses currently taught may lose viability as a result of the lack of numbers. Basically the system will move from one which is based on forward planning and cooperation to one of Rafferty's rules. It allows anyone to set up schools without any real check on how it is going to affect the viability of those schools already operating in the area. The coalition fundamentally intends by this bill to encourage the exodus of students from government schools to private schools. It intends to do that by taking money out of the public school system. The method of funding under the bill has been analysed by Louise Watson from the Australian National University. She notes: The Federal government provides an annual grant of $406 per student in government schools. In comparison, it provides an average grant of $2091 per student in non-government schools. Thus when a student moves from a government school to a non-government school, the Federal government saves $406, has to outlay $2091. The transfer of a student between sectors is therefore a net cost to the Commonwealth of $1685 per student. That is equivalent, in practical terms, to one desktop computer. If enrolments in non-government schools increase by 80,000 students over the next four years, as the government predicts, the net additional cost will $150.4 million. However, the government plans to pay for that additional charge by taking money away from kids already in government schools. Louise Watson also notes: The major offset will be obtained by cutting $1712 from the government schools' Recurrent Grants Program every time a student enrols in a nongovernment school. This offset-euphemistically entitled ""the Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment"" ... is expected to recover about $128 million from government schools' recurrent funding ... The second offset will be the average Federal grant of $406 per student saved from not funding a student in the government school, which will saveagain at the expense of government schoolsabout $30 million over the four years. Given the differences in Federal funding levels between government and non-government schools, the reduction of $2118 will not be a one-for-one adjustment in per student funding. As Louise Watson points out, effectively every time a government student moves to a non-government school, it will mean a reduction in federal funding equivalent to an extra four students in government schools. That, quite simply, is an outrage. The Australian schools lobby has described the euphemism of the enrolment benchmark as a con trick. It was reported in the Canberra Times on 8 October as saying: The Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment is a disgraceful confidence trick to conceal a major cut in federal funding for state schools . . . calling a cut in funding an adjustment doesn't change the fact that state schools will pay for all future increases in private school enrolments. Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald on 5 October, Adele Horin described the effect of this bill in the following terms: Right under our noses, the government school system is being privati sed, but few seem to realise or care. With all the attention on Te1stra, the Federal Government's changes to school funding have escaped debate. Yet they are as radical as anything proposed for the phone company. It is radical at the expense of kids in government schools. To continue: The quality of government schools, already suspect, will surely deteriorate with the projected 25 per cent cut in Federal funding over four years. be The Feds provide, it is true, only 13 per cent of State school funding, but $150 million is an amount the hard-pressed system can't afford to lose. . But there is a bit in it for everyone-that is, except the kids in government schools and the teachers who are trying to do their best for them with the resources that they have. In his second reading speech on 19 September, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) referred to the fact that it is cheaper for the government to educate children in private schools than in government schools. He outlined how the government intends to hold back 50 per cent of net recurrent savings to a state or territory from students shifting from government to non-government schools. The government is not content merely to strip the public school system; it is sending in the looters to finish the job. Those funds they withhold should immediately be allocated to the public school education system. The government's gutting of the public education system by the measures contained in the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 1996 is in addition to the huge cuts to untied grants to the states announced at this year's Premiers Conference. Those cuts-$1 V2 billion over three years-equate to about $300 million in reductions to the states' discretionary funding for schools. Moreover, it is a gross misrepresentation to suggest that the government's literacy program is a creation of this government. The program was introduced by Labor in the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No.2) in 1995 and it was based on the 1991 white paper, Australia's language: the Australian literary and language policy, and the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training report, The literacy challenge. Again, it is grossly dishonest of this government to allege that it has a new initiative in the literacy program. It is not that at all. In addition, the students with disability program was again a creation of the Labor government, in the 1995 bill. But, in respect of that later program, it has been noted that there is another broken promise to students with disabilities-one of the most educationally disadvantaged groups-with the Howard government's commitment to increase funding to those students by $16V2 million being abandoned. Mark Twain said, 'The greatest knowledge one can have is the knowledge of people.' I regard myself as very fortunate in having obtained that knowledge by learning and growing up with people from all backgrounds in my public education-first at Connells Point Primary School and later at the Blakehurst High School. Unfortunately, that depth in our public education system is being eroded by this government. The public school system is being so under-resourced that any parent who can afford to send their children to private schools in all probably will do so. If this government remains in office for any period of time, our public school system will become very much a residual system for those from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds. That will be a very great tragedy in Australia's history-a very great tragedy indeed. I am reminded of reports from a member of the government who said that the fact that students from higher socio-economic backgrounds were more prevalent in universities suggested that children from such backgrounds were more intelligent. Those statements to that effect are to be condemned. There is no such thing as inherited intelligence. Unfortunately, there is such a thing as inherited disadvantage. This government is doing nothing whatsoever about inherited disadvantage. Education is the one area where society can be evened up. It is the one area where opportunities can be redressed and made a little more equal. This government is winding the clock right back. It will be only those children from more well-off families that are going to access those schools with the majority of resources. Those schools, under this government, will be the private schools. The public school system is being laid to waste by this government. It is being turned into something which is residual and, unfortunately, second class. This is one of the most unfortunate bills the government has brought into the House since it was elected to office this year.",13
3,Mr LINDSAY,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I simply say this to the previous speaker, the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), in relation to his last comments: lower socio-economic groups in the ages 15 to 24 comprise 25 per cent of the population, but only 16 per cent of that population get to university. That is the point you were making. But, of course, you had 13 years to fix it and did not. That was the point I was making in the James Cook student union newspaper that you referred to. The kind of link you are making between children who are brought up in higher socio-economic groups and IQ is true also-and I can produce the research. When that IQ is measured, it is in fact higher and the research is there on the world scene. It cannot be disputed. It actually does exist, and that is because of the point you were making. Children should not be disadvantaged because their parents are in a higher socio-economic group. I agree, and I disagree with your comments. There is one another point I should makeand I notice there is a school in the gallery this morning-in relation to the national literacy program which you referred to. It is true that it was an initiative of the previous government, but of course the problem today is one high school student in five cannot properly read or write. That is really sad. My message to the school in the gallery this morning is that, as an employer, when I go to employ people I look for an applicant's ability to read and write. It is fundamental and basic to employing a person that they should be able to read and write. The message to the schools and to the government is that this is an intolerable situation. This bill massively increases the resources available in the national literacy program, so we are certainly proceeding very much down the track to do something about it. Before I start to go into the detail of this bill, I would like to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the House to an agreement reached between Townsville State High School and the Townsville regional group apprenticeship scheme-TORGAS. On Friday, 6 September Townsville High and TORGAS signed an agreement, a memorandum of understanding, linking the year 11 and 12 school certificate with paid apprenticeship or traineeship work experience. It was a great result. That memorandum of understanding, by the way, is actually hanging on the office wall of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) here in Parliament House. The arrangement reached between Townsville High and TORGAS was significant for Townsville and for North Queensland. I thank the honourable member for Goldstein, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, for being on hand to witness the signing of that contract. As the honourable member for Goldstein said back then, this traineeship scheme will clear the path to real sad jobs for the 30 per cent of schoolleavers who do not go on to tertiary education. Since 20 August, this government's policies in relation to primary and secondary education have been welcomed right across Australia. One policy welcomed by non-government schools was the overturning of the previous government's unfair new schools policy. Parents should have the right to choose which school they want to send their children to. At the same time, the government has also guaranteed Australian schools more than $14,000 million in funding over the next four years. The State Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill provides some specific funding details, the lion's share of which will go to government schools on the basis that this is where those particular funds are needed most. But without doubt the one area which has been most warmly welcomed has been the move by this government to provide a direct working and training link between secondary schools and business with an eye to generating more apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities for those people who choose not to immediately pursue tertiary education. The agreement reached between TORGAS and Townsville State High School formalises and extends a training program that has now been successfully operating in Townsville for several years. The memorandum of understanding reached between TORGAS and Townsville High states: TORGAS has, over the past several years, had considerable links with the Secondary Schools and together with the Townsville State High School wish to expand the Vocational Training by linking schools and business together to adopt the intent of the Australian Government to enhance the career opportunities of our school students. Townsville High's principal, Bill Sperring, recently sent me a fax outlining 11 points exactly what this initiative meant to his school. Just to highlight four of these points, Mr Sperring said: This initiative provides a direct working productive link between a secondary school and apprenticeship training organisation ... The gains of our individual students will be that they can see, and will be associated with apprentices first hand to know the requirements for vocational training the workforce . . . The initiative will give students access to industrial equipment and project development processes according to industry competency standards . . . This link between an education and training organisation, and much more can be gained by all involved as we chart a future within the framework of Memorandum of Understanding. A few days or so before the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training arrived in Townsville, I happened to catch the end of a radio talkback interview a local station was conducting with a senior board member of the Townsville Chamber of Comcan merce. A question was raised about apprenand ticeship and traineeship opportunities in society to which the chamber of commerce member said that it was an avenue of employnon-existent. ment opportunity which had been neglected for so long by successive governments at both state and federal levels that centres such Townsville had a chronic lack of tradespeople and specialists. This is certainly the case in the industry I come from where is very difficult indeed to get young people join the industry. Under the previous government, apprenticeskills. ships fell to their lowest level in 30 years. This is disgraceful. This government is per cent committed to turning this around. The agreement signed between Townsville State High School and TORGAS and witwords nessed by the minister stands as a clear symbol of what this government wants to initiated in more communities, more schools and more businesses and industry groups throughout the country. Projects such as these will clear the path to all. real jobs for the 30 per cent or so of school leavers who do not go on to higher education studies. Already, the TORGAS general manager, Alan Morris, has indicated publicly that he expects the number of apprentices and of trainees in the Townsville region to increase from around 180 to more than 1,000 within the next 18 months. That is great news. Another issue that came up with the and Minister for Schools, Vocational Education an and Training while he was in Townsville was the literacy standards in our schools, which I referred to earlier. Part 7 of this bill refers to in the early literacy program introduced by the our previous government to support literacy development for children from low socioecoagreed nomic backgrounds in their early years of is a real working schooling. I do not think anyone in this House would our dispute the need to address the problem of illiteracy in society. In his second reading of this bill, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) described illiteracy as 'the worse form of poverty' and 'a blight on our society'. It is a blight on our society, and a needless one at that. It is difficult to imagine that a person go through years and years of primary secondary school teaching and come out at the end with literacy and numeracy skills that are either inadequate or next to being But it does happen. It has been estimated by some that the whole problem of illiteracy costs Australia anywhere between as $3,000 million and $6,000 million a year. young This too is a needless cost. I guess that one of the biggest problems in it the fight against illiteracy is the number of to different and conflicting theories surrounding how best to approach the teaching of literacy Some people advocate the use of phonics-the sounding out of written words100 as the best tool to teach people to read. Others again say that this approach is not a universally good teaching method as not all sound the way they appear on paper. Some blame teachers and schools for not see putting enough time into actual literacy studies, and others that children are being overwhelmed by a myriad of different subjects and that it is not the teachers' fault at As with the other areas, the coalition's approach to addressing literacy and numeracy studies differs from that of the former government. Back in July the minister announced a national literacy survey. Some 9,000 students from 450 primary schools throughout Australia-4,500 year 3 students and 4,500 year 5 students-took part in this survey. According to the minister's press release, the survey assessed a range of skills including reading, writing, speaking, listening and viewing skills. Results from the survey are expected early in 1997 and will form a significant part of establishing Australia's first national literacy goal-that is, establishing certain national literacy benchmarks for year 3 and year 5 students and ensuring that every child leaving primary school can read and write to an appropriate standard. I look forward to that report being presented. The coalition's benchmark proposal also has the cooperation of the state and territory governments. This national approach to tackling illiteracy as a problem is a first for Australia, and a long overdue one at that. The last point I tum to in relation to this bill is the languages program. This bill has given priority to Asian languages, and with good reason. Despite what Pauline Hanson thinks, Australia depends on Asian markets for the vast majority of its trade. South-East Asia is a dynamic and growing region, and Australia is in a good position geographically to take full advantage of this. Certainly my electorate, based in Townsville, is very well positioned in this country to take advantage of the supermarket to Asia strategy recently introduced by the government. In the short time. I have been in this parliament, I have stood in this place and said time and time again that Townsville and, indeed, the entire Top End of Australia should be positioning itself and aggressively targeting markets to our near north. The economic potential of the Asia-Pacific region is enormous, and we should be doing everything we can to try to facilitate trade. Far from stealing our jobs, increased trade and interaction with this region will stimulate employment and economic growth in North Queensland. To briefly quote again from the second reading speech of this bill by the member for Flinders, on behalf of the minister: Clearly, it is important to the development of Australia's trade relations for businesses in this country to have leaders and staff who are proficient in Asian languages and who have an understanding of Asian cultures. That statement was as true 10 years ago as it is today. On that note, I commend the bill to the House.",16
4,Mr OCONNOR,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Corio) (10.04 a.m.)The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill now before the House contains measures that will have a profound effect on the provision of public and private education in this country for many years to come. By abolishing the previous Labor government's new schools policy, by giving new non-government schools access to higher levels of recurrent funding and by giving all non-government schools access to recurrent funding for new students, the government has ensured a further expansion of non-government schools in Australia, and that is likely to be at the expense of the public education system in this country. I am not sure whether all members of the Howard government's backbench fully understand the dimensions of the long-term changes to education in Australia that are foreshadowed by this coalition bill. They ought to take some time to reach that understanding because this bill will have a profound effect on the provision of a quality public education to the sons and daughters of the majority of their constituents. For over a century Australia has built one of the best public education systems in the world. It has been that public education system that has underpinned the economic and social progress of this nation throughout the 20th century. The public education system has given the sons and daughters of working people access to personal, economic and social opportunities. It is that quality public education system that stands to be most affected and diminished by this legislation now before the House. Primary and secondary education in Australia has traditionally been the responsibility of state and territory governments. However, since the Second World War, and more particularly since the 1960s, we have seen a greater Commonwealth funding involvement in these areas of education. This process began in 1946 with amendments to the Australian constitution after a referendum which expanded Commonwealth power under section 51 of the constitution and extended Commonwealth involvement in the education area. The Commonwealth has also used section 96 of the constitution to grant 'financial assistance to any state on such terms and conditions as this parliament thinks fit'. That led in 1964 to the process of direct Commonwealth aid to the non-government sector. The expanded role of the Commonwealth in funding non-government schools was not without vigorous debate within both the major political parties of this country and the generany al community at the time. It was a very divisive and sectarian debate, and it raged for some time on the issue of state aid to nongovernment schools. It is that debate, sadly, which will be revived over time by this bill now before the House. The essence of that debate at the end of the day acknowledged two key propositions as far as primary and secondary education in Australia were concerned. The first was that the state had a responsibility to ensure access to and the viability of a sound public education system in Australia. The second acknowledged the right of the non-government sector to exist and to be supported by the national government to ensure that adequate educational standards are promoted and maintained throughout the education sector in this country. Labor in government was able to get that delicate balance pretty right and, while the principle of choice was upheld and expanded, the public education system was supported and the cherished principle of children having access to a decent and quality education regardless of race, religion or political was upheld also and promoted. There are several elements of this bill that are of particular concern to the opposition and they raise serious questions about the future of public primary and secondary education in this country. The foremost change directed by the bill is the abolition of the previous Labor government's new schools policy. That policy was originally introduced to provide a planning framework for the establishment of new schools and to preserve in an area the viability of existing educational infrastructure. While there have been some criticisms directed at this policy from very narrow and sectional interests from time to time, it has provided a fair and equitable way of guiding the development of new educational facilities in this country. The abolition of that policy by this government alters radically the dynamics and the overall parameters that guide the establishment of new educational institutions in various communities throughout the length and breadth of this country. This bill will allow group to set up a new school as long as it satisfies very minimum state and territory registration requirements. The implications of this particular policy are twofold. It will further stimulate the movement of students from the government to the non-government sector. The effect of this will be to weaken the viability of government schools and undermine the viability of some non-government schools as well. The bill also effectively dismantles the planning framework that has prevented the undue fragmentation within the educational sector and offers the prospect of eventually diminishing curricula offerings in established non-government and government schools in particular communities. Another significant change which is outlined in this bill provides non-systemic schools, if eligible, to access funding from the full range of categories. The sting in this bill for the public education system in this country lies in the manner in which the government intends to finance the changes to primary and secondary educational funding through this bill. It proposes to belief do this through its enrolment benchmark adjustment. Simply put, the Howard government intends to fund this expansion by taking money out of the public school system. To put it even more simply, for every new student who moves to a private school from January 1997, the Howard government will cut its funding for four government school students. This is indeed a very dangerous policy in social terms. It will lead to further movement of students from the public school system and it will eventually lead to a massive run-down of that sector in this country. Effectively, this means that the quality of public schools will diminish even further as funding is cut by, we estimate, some 25 per cent over the next four years. There has already been a significant shift of students from the government to the nongovernment sector in Australia. Enrolment in non-government schools in 1983 stood at 24.4 per cent. In 1995 that had increased to 29 per cent, one of the highest levels in the OECD industrialised countries. Since 1988, for example, the growth in enrolments in nongovernment schools has been in the order of 9.3 per cent while government enrolments have only increased by 0.5 per cent. On the question of funding of private education in Australia compared with other Western countries, the OECD reported in 1992 that an analysis of the level of public subsidies to private education in 12 industrialised countries ranked Australia as the fourth highest level in granting subsidies to the private sector. What do the general community and general commentators on education think about the bill that we are debating in the House today? I want to quote to the House the views of a recently formed group called the Australian Schools Lobby which has very prominent educationalists associated with it. It said that the bill before the House will 'fundamentally change the structure of Australian schooling without consultation or public debate'. That is what this government is really on about, changing the nature of primary and secondary education in this country, substantially withdrawing funding from the public education sector and transferring it to the private education sector and doing it without adequate public debate and without consultation with the most important constituencies in that educational community. This is what the Australian Schools Lobby had to say about these changes: We feel the changes are going to affect both existing government and non-government schoolsit is going to affect private schools as wellas it allows anyone to set up a school with no real checks on how it is going to affect the viability of those schools already operating within the area. This is a government that prides itself on trying to achieve budgetary efficiencies and some degree of fiscal responsibility. It is intending to pursue a strategy of forcing students out of the public education system into smaller private schools and it is going to fund that by reducing the moneys that are available to the public school sector. The Australian Schools Lobby went on further with very strong language about the enrolment benchmark adjustment, which underpins the government's transference of money from the public education system to the private education system. They had this to say: The Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment is a disgraceful confidence trick to conceal a major cut in federal funding for state schools . . . calling a cut in funding an adjustment doesn't change the fact that state schools will pay for all future increases in private school enrolments. I do not think they are very wrong in categorising this benchmark adjustment as a disgraceful confidence trick. On 5 October in the Sydney Morning Herald Adele Horin had this to say: Even more than previous governments, this one is providing huge incentives to .middle-class parents to leave the State system. The consequences for standards, equity and social cohesion have been ignored in the clamour for greater parental choice. As I have already outlined, the changes in this bill, especially the abolition of the new schools policy, will exacerbate that movement from the public to the private education sector in this country. This will result in a fall in the educational capital which is available to government schools. They will increasingly become schools for the poor and in the end may very well become ghetto schools. This is in no-one's interest-not in the government's interest, not in the opposition's interest, not in the interests of the wider community of this country. Any move in this direction ought to be opposed on both equity and social justice grounds. Education must be firmly based on a strong public sector, open to all and representative of all social structures in the community. Another problem that is associated with this bill will be the establishment of new schools in areas already well served by government and non-government schools. This will result in massive wastage of resources. It is madness to have existing structures in which the community has invested considerable resources over the years standing underutilised while at the same time allocating Commonwealth moneys to new educational enterprises in communities. The right of parents to have a choice of education available is not denied, but it is unlimited. It is economically sensible that the choice of the range of educational options to be made available in any community should be made early in the development phase of any new community. The range of schools should generally be established as a community grows and thereafter should not change much, except in exceptional circumstances. There is also a danger that a significant number of the expected explosion in new schools will represent a very narrow range of sectional and religious interests. In the past, the educational offering made by such groups has often been very narrow and even quite discriminatory, for example, against women. There is no guarantee that the registration processes in some states will provide sufficient safeguards against the establishment of second-rate educational institutions. In the remainder of the time available to me, let me comment, if I may, on the record of Labor in government in the education area as I think any fair assessment of our achievements will demonstrate that over the last 13 years we made great strides in promoting the access of all Australians to quality education. We take great pride in the achievement with regard to the improvement in the rate of retention to year 12. When we came to office in 1983, barely 36 per cent of students went on to complete their secondary education. That was an abysmal rate for an industrialised country of our stature. In 1996 when we left government that retention rate had increased to 78 per cent. That is a source of great pride for this party while we were in government.. During that 13 years we saw a massive increase in the funding going to schools in both private and public sectors, in primary and secondary education, both for capital and recurrent purposes. It stood at $3 billion in 1996 when we left office. While we were in government, there was a strong recognition by Labor of the special problems and the need to lift the standards of outcomes in certain areas of education. In 1994-95 we provided substantial funding to overcoming illiteracy. I am very pleased to say that this particular government has followed Labor's lead in allocating not resources to overcoming this very important problem in Australia. In the lead-up to the 1996 election we committed a further $55 million over three years to school based literacy programs. While we were in government there was an acknowledgment of the economic needs of students and their families with the expansion of Austudy, which played an important role in the great improvement in the retention rates at the secondary level which I mentioned earlier. In the concluding remarks in the debate on this bill, let me say a few words about the unsung heroes in our work force-the teachers, the people to whom we entrust the care of our children and the future of the nation. We are extremely blessed in the electorate of Corio with an extensive public and private educational infrastructure and a teaching profession that are committed to excellence. Within the public and the private educational sector in my electorate, there has been in the past, and I hope in the future, a high degree of cooperation between teachers in both those sectors. I hope that, as we progress in the years following this bill, communities can stay together in an educational sense and not be divided by the sectarian debates which we have had in the past. If this government had any mind to the history of education in this country and the very divisive natures of those past debates, it would not be doing the things that it is doing in the bill before the House. (Time expired)",19
5,Mrs BAILEY,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"I rise todayÂ· to support the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill, and I do so with a degree of pride. The previous speaker, the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), in his comments addressing this legislation seemed to be concerned about any need for change. This bill highlights the absolute need for change. It seems extraordinary that members of the opposition would be so upset about denying parents the right to choose where their children receive their education. One of the areas that is in great need of change is the area I want to speak about today. I want to highlight the particular aspect of the bill which provides for funding for literacy programs. This bill lists literacy as one of the five priority areas the government will target for assistance within primary and secondary education. As part of that commitment, the government will spend approximately $600 million for literacy programs in schools throughout Australia over the next four years. Most importantly, this bill provides $45 million for the implementation and development of a national literacy and numeracy strategy, which will help to improve the reading, writing and numeracy skills of all school children. . Literacy is not an issue which often grabs the headlines, but it is a problem which can have damaging ramifications for all those who are affected. Take a moment to imagine spending just one week out of your life being unable to read. You could not look up a name in a telephone book or check a bus timetable. You could not read a street sign, the name of a business or look up a street directory to work out directions. You could not read a newspaper, a TV guide or your favourite magazine. You could not use a computer. You could not even read your own mail. You would not be able to drive and even finding the right train station would often be impossible. In fact, your whole life would be restricted to very narrow options. The sad facts are that one million Australian adults and up to 10 per cent of the entire population have literacy problems. I just outlined the problems that those people face every day. They are unable or restricted to take part in mainstream society because they simply do not have the fundamental skills to participate effectively in daily life. WithoutÂ· basic reading and writing skills, most school leavers have little or no chance of finding suitable full-time employment. Research indicates that as many as one in five children cannot read and write adequately when they finish school. I find those statistics absolutely appalling. We do have a quality education system, as the previous speaker said, yet that system is failing up to 20 per cent of our students. If we do not teach them to read and write adequately at school, then we are literally sending them off to join the dole queue. If they have no literacy skills, if they cannot take down a simple phone message, read an occupational safety sign, fill out a job application, read the newspapers or job boards for vacancies, then they have limited job opportunities available to them. If they do not manage to find a job within a year of leaving school, they face a very real prospect of becoming long-tenn unemployed. This frequently leads to anger, frustration, depression and all sorts of other social problems. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released in August show the youth full-time unemployment rate at 27.1 per cent. In some parts of my electorate of MCEwen youth unemployment is as high as 40 per cent. One of the ways in which we as a society can help to address the youth unemployment problem is by ensuring that students finishing school to join the work force can read, write and communicate at a suitable level. The previous Labor government certainly did precious little to address the youth unemployment problem during its 13 years in power. In fact, when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was minister for employment, Australia's unemployment rate reached its highest level since the Great Depression, and youth unemployment nationally reached a level of just over 32 per cent. There are a number of factors which contribute to our unacceptably high unemployment levels, and it is clear that literacy has a major bearing on people's individual employment prospects. By doing nothing, we are creating black holes in our communities. By beginning to address the problem, as the Howard government is, we are saying that we do not accept these high levels of illiteracy and we are going to do something about itunlike our predecessors. When addressing the literacy problem, we as a government must ensure that the unique challenges of providing literacy services to rural communities in particular are addressed. Research shows that literacy problems are higher in some rural areas, particularly where isolation, limited job opportunities and poverty can be a disadvantage. Throughout my electorate, a number of adult and community education centres run adult literacy programs in the community or act as a referral point courses in neighbouring towns. From speaking with these groups, I understand that there are three major obstacles facing literacy program providers in rural areas: first, public awareness of literacy programs; second, access to those programs; and, third, the social stigma which continues to surround the problem of illiteracy. Most people with literacy problems in rural areas do not know about the programs available to help them because they do not live in the world of print. They cannot read pamphlets, newspaper articles or community notice boards which may publicise availability of literacy programs. Television and radio are the best method of communication, but this is costly and can be difficult for many in rural areas to access. The International Year of Literacy in the late eighties went some way towards helping to increase public awareness about literacy. But, once the year ended, the spotlight focused on another worthwhile issue, and the attention given to literacy dissipated. Access to centres which provide literacy programs is another hurdle which is difficult to overcome for country people. It has taken the efforts of this government to begin to . correct that. A lack of regular public transevery port, coupled with high fuel costs and few child-care options, means that many people simply cannot get into programs. In many small rural communities, people with literacy problems are either too shy orÂ· embarrassed to seek help because of the stigma which surrounds their problem. Morrithat son House is a community centre which provides literacy programs to young people and adults in the Yarra Valley, in my electorate of MCEwen. The centre has offered to provide courses to many towns in MCEwen, such as Healesville. However, it has been found that local residents prefer to travel to other towns to attend classes where they are not known. In smaller communities, it is often difficult for people to attend local literacy classes without others finding out through the local grapevine. Jan Simmons, who is a literacy for educator at Morrison House, said that at one of her classes she had a student who hid in the comer of the classroom all semester because he had a relative doing VeE classes at the centre and did not want her to see him. She said that students who are hesitant about telling people that they are learning to read and write are advised to say that they are doing English classes and not specify what type. It is important that we change this stigma which surrounds the problem of illiteracy. It should not be an embarrassment for the people who have these problems; it should be an embarrassment for the wider community and an embarrassment for the previous government which have allowed this problem to develop to the extent that it now affects many communities. There needs to be a united approach taken by the whole community towards tackling this problem. The Howard government has taken the first step through its literacy and numeracy strategy and national literacy survey. The development and implementation of a national literacy and numeracy strategy was part of the government's education policy before the election. I am proud to say that this is yet another promise which the coalition is delivering in full. The strategy aims to ensure that child develops at least adequate literacy and numeracy skills by the end of year 3 by focusing on children who need extra support. This will help to ensure that they are not educationally disadvantaged later at secondary school. In order to address the problem effectively, we must first have current, accurate and reliable national data on literacy levels among Australians. The Howard government is addressing this information gap through the historic national literacy survey, which has just been completed. This is the first literacy survey in Australia for 16 years and involved 9,000 students in 450 primary schools around the nation. The results from the survey will provide governments, teachers, parents and the wider education community with a detailed picture of the literacy levels of Australian children. With this information, we can help ensure that literacy programs are effective and that resources are being used efficiently. The survey results are expected next year and play a key role in the development of the federal government's planned national literacy policy, which will be used as the basis for national literacy strategy. The responsibility for literacy does not belong with governments alone. Parents have an important role to play in the their children by reading with their children at home, supervising homework, encouraging conversation and helping to develop life skills, particularly as it is believed that most of our learning happens outside the classroom. Our educators must also play their part in helping to provide literacy standards. It vital that the basic fundamental skills reading, writing and communicating are the achieved and developed during the first years of schooling. Students have little or no chance of ing highly proficient in reading and writing if we do not begin to address the problem until secondary school or even later in life. But, in saying that, I must stress that we should continue to support adults who need help with their literacy skills, particularly those disading vantaged in rural areas. I believe it must also be recognised that many people with literacy p-oblems have those problems because they. dId not learn the usual way in the school system. As Jan Simmons states: These people are not unintelligent, they just could not learn academically. We can teach them, but only over time. If they didn't learn how to read and write after 10 years in the education system, they are not going to learn it in one year. You just have to change the way the learning is happening. We link literacy to a situation where they are actually doing things. I say to the previous speaker, the member for Corio, that these are some of the methods of change that this government is going to implement. . There are many success stories involving hteracy programs. Jan Simmons told me that Morrison House's last self-funded youth literacy program involving unemployed street kids had a 100 per cent success rate, with each of the 12 participants finding a job or going on to college or other training. I commend the government on its commitwill ment to literacy in schools and urge the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) to ensure that this the government commitment is continued for school leavers and adults. It is too late for them to be helped by programs in primary and secondary schools but it is not too late for them to be helped through wider comliteracy of munity education programs. Of course, if the opposition and members of the Democrats continue their efforts to frustrate the passage of this budget, Australia's literacy problems will not improve. The longer these measures are delayed, the more is the problems will escalate. What am I supof posed to tell my constituents in MCEwen if opposition continues with its obstructionist attitude? Am I supposed to tell them that nothing can be done to improve literacy in our schools and among our young people becombecause the opposition does not care? The Howard government certainly does care. We want to give our young people every possible advantage to ensure they have a better chance of finding a job and participatfully in the community. That is why it is essential that this budget is passed quicklyto give our children a chance of a brighter future. I commend this bill to the House.",23
6,Dr KEMP,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (l0.41 a.m.)-I welcome the opportunity to close this debate on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill and to make some remarks about matters that have been raised by members on both sides of the chamber in the course of the debate. This is a very significant piece of legislation. It provides funding security for Australian government and non-government schools for the next four years. It increases funding by some 17 per cent to government and non-government schools. One would have to say that this is an excellent outcome for Australian schools and Australian students. I thank members who have participated in this debate for their very thoughtful contributions. I instance particularly the government members who have referred to the fundamental importance of literacy for Australian students. In the view of the government, lack of literacy and numeracy skills are perhaps the greatest educational disadvantage that any student can suffer. If they fail to acquire these skills in the course of their schooling years, particularly, as the member for MCEwen has just mentioned, in the early years of schooling and the first three years of schooling, the chances are that they will be disadvantaged for life. Therefore, our literacy emphasis and literacy programs are a key element of the government's approach to equity in education. We hear the use of the term 'equity' from the other side of the House on many occasions. Yet when we review the record of the last 13 years and listen to this debate, we cannot help but come to the view that they have absolutely no idea what equity in education really consists of. If students do not have educational programs which provide them with the fundamentals on which they can build their lives, they have been treated most unfairly. We have just been through a period of 13 years where no progress whatever has been made in the solution to the literacy program. It was a government that refused to measure literacy outcomes. There have been no significant measures of literacy outcomes for the last 16 years until this government introduced the first national English literacy survey. In many ways, this debate is quite a historic debate. It shows, first of all, that the govern- . ment is committed to quality education for all Australian school children, whatever school they attend, and it shows that, despite the ideology of the previous government, it had been in power for 13 years until the last election and had absolutely no idea how to strengthen government schooling in Australia to ensure that there is quality education for every student. We have seen-and I will demonstrate this by going through the details of what the opposition speakers have put before the House-the utter confusion, the inaccuracy and the damaging nature for public schooling in this country of the proposals which are being put forward by way of amendment in this debate by the opposition speakers. . My conclusion in this debate will be that, if they are the friends of government schooling, government schools do not need enemies because the measures that are being put forward by the opposition will have significantly adverse effects on government schooling and significantly adverse effects on the quality of schooling for all Australian students. Let me now go through and detail the errors, the misconceptions, the confusion and the failure to learn from experience of the shadow minister for education and youth affairs at the table, the member for Sydney  behind him who have spoken in this debate. A frequent claim in this debate was that there are cuts to funding for government schools. There are no cuts to funding for government schools. This piece of legislation increases funding for government schools and for non-government schools by $167 million in this year alone-as I said, a 17 per cent increase in funding over the four-year period to which this piece of legislation applies. The shadow minister for education referred to a number of Labor election promises, including the national professional development program and programs for information technology and literacy. There were no funding commitments for literacy at all in the forward estimates.  selves to fund it.",25
7,Dr KEMP,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"The national professional development program was unfunded in the forward estimates. It was a four-year program. I simply ask the shadow minister: how did they intend to fund these election promises? What possible guarantee-given the $10 billion deficit that the previous government left because of their irresponsible economic management-can anyone have that any of these election promises were other than completely empty? There is no guarantee whatsoever that the shadow minister at the table would have got these promises through the Expenditure Review Committee on his side of the House had they been returned to government. The shadow minister also claimed that the $20 million a year for the modem Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system was not new money. It is true that it is money that been in the vocational education and training budget, but it is new money for schools. It is new money to encourage vocational education programs in schools, money that would not otherwise have been available to Australian schools to encourage them to offer relevant programs for the 65 per cent of students who are not going on to university or full-time TAFE and who are dropping out of school and going onto the unemployment queues because of the complete failure of the previous government to put in place programs that would offer assistance to these students. So much for the empty rhetoric of equity that we hear from the other side. The failure, the betrayal of these students, by the previous government is one of the colossal social unfairnesses that was left to this country by the Labor Party, and they were adequately reprimanded for this in the results of the last election. The shadow minister contended that there would be a drop in capital funding for nongovernment schools of $41 million. This is simply not true. The previous Labor government's forward estimates for 1997 and beyond provided for a drop in non-government capital funding of $42.4 million in 1996 prices, from the 1996 level of $115.5 million. The government lessened the impact of this cut and fulfilled its election promises by adding an additional $10 million to the forward estimates to bring 1997 non-government capital funding to $83 million, an increase over the capital funding that the previous government had put in the forward estimates. ",27
8,Dr KEMP,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Let's not have this constant reference from the shadow minister to these empty promises which could never be funded with the $10 billion deficit that you left. The shadow minister drew comparison between the 1995-96 and 1996-97 budget papers and what appears to be a policy and funding shift between government and non-government schools. Those differences in the forward estimates relate to both actual enrolment shifts and changes in supplementation outcomes which account for the great proportion of this change in the figures. Of course, the figures has are going to vary according to the actual movements in the price index. That is the major cause of the movements in these figures. It is a total distortion to suggest that these changes in the forward estimates relate to decisions which cut government school funding. I have said-and I will repeat again and again because we are hearing this constant misrepresentation from the oppositionthat government school funding is substantially increased by the legislation before the House. The opposition believes that the new schools policy was an important way of protecting the government sector and controlling the growth of the non-government sector. Here I come to perhaps the single greatest self-delusion that exists on the other side of the House. Members will be quite astonished when I outline the facts and what the effects of the opposition's amendments will be. During the previous government's restrictive non-schools policy, at the time when that was in place from 1995 onwards, the proportion of students in non-government schools increased from 24.4 per cent in 1983 to 29 per cent in 1985. The opposition claims that somehow or other these measures, which it hopes are going to be reinstated in this legislation, are going to stop the outflow from the nongovernment schools or slow it down. The outflow sped up when the Labor Party's new schools policy was in place. The rate of outflow from the government to the nongovernment sector was greater in the 10 years when that policy was in place than in the 10 years",27
9,Dr KEMP,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Let us come to that point. The fact is that the fundamental premise of the policy was flawed. The previous government never addressed the reasons why this outflow was occurring. It never advocated policies that would give the government school sector the flexibility and the capacity to adjust. It never argued for policies that would demonstrate the quality in the government school sector to parents. It allowed a black market in imperfect information to exist among parents-a whispering campaign perhaps that distorted the quality in the government sector-because it would never measure outcomes. It simply refused to allow the government schools to give information to the parents about the quality of the education that was occurring in that sector. Let us look at the policy that the Labor Party still supports. Its policy sought to restrict parental choice. It impacted most heavily on low income families who wanted to exercise choice because it restricted the government subsidies to non-government schools, which sought to appeal to those families, and offered them their choices to category 6 funding, which is a much lower level of funding than was available previously to low fee non-government schools. This was another inequity in this policy because it damaged most children from low income families. We have removed that. I am pleased to say that the opposition at least does not wish to reinstate this particular inequity which it supported throughout its final years in office, but it does seek to change the decisions that we have announced in relation to the particular matter of what we are calling the enrolment benchmark adjustment-the mechanism which will allow the Commonwealth to share in any savings which the states will make as a result of the movement of pupils from government to non-government schools. The average saving for state governments when a pupil moves from a government to aÂ· non-government school is $3,400. The Commonwealth is saying to the states, 'You have, over the last decade or so, made savings of the order of $3 billion as a result of this outflow.' Listen to this, Shadow Minister: the states have had, under your policy, a very big incentive to shift students from government to non-government schools. I do not know whether that incentive has influenced their policies, but it may have, because it is a very big financial incentive under your policies. In the legislation that we are putting forward, we propose to have that incentive-to cut it back so that it is reduced. What the shadow minister wants to do is to amend this piece of legislation to double the incentive to state governments to cost-shift. If you reject the enrolment benchmark adjustment and you want to reinstate the previous situation where the states make the whole saving, you are doubling the incentive to state governments to cost-shift. This is the utter confusion that exists in the minds of the opposition. If they could just apply their minds to it for a moment and break free of the ideology which governs their education policy, they would see that what they are proposing is likely to intensify the movement, as actually occurred and was demonstrated during the period of their own new schools policy when the rate of outflow sped up. We are proposing to reduce the incentives; they want to reinstate the larger incentive. We just heard the shadow minister say, 'But you're taking money away from government school students and they are going to beÂ· worse off.' Wrong. Absolutely wrong. The fact is that the per capita funds remaining for every government school student as a result of this policy actually increase. There is more funding per student for every government school student after the result. There is more funding, and that greater funding allows the government school sector to improve the quality of what it offers to its remaining students. It is a stabilising factor in the flow. Think it through clearly. You are utterly confused on this point, and your proposed amendments will be quite counterproductive. Why is this happening? We discovered when we came into office that the previous government had almost no contact with the leaders of the government school sector-the primary principals and the secondary principals. What we are hearing in this debate is a line run by a particular ideological group-the Australian Education Union, a big contributor to the Labor Party, which are seeking to defend their own institutional base, foolishly, because their left-wing ideology actually prevents them from making a sensible policy analysis. There has never been a sensible policy analysis from the left faction to whom the shadow minister at the table belongs because they cannot see past their narrow ideology. It is the politics of the warm inner glow, as I think the previous Prime Minister said. They talk about equity, and they create unfairness. Mr Tony Smith-Myopic.",28
10,Dr KEMP,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"They are utterly myopic in their ability to really address the issues of disadvantage, inequity and injustice. They are the kinds of friends who have actually damaged over the last 10 years government schooling in this country. They want to increase the outflow. They want to double the position in this legislation-the incentive for state governments to cost-shift. I urge them to rethink this nonsense before they reiterate it in the Senate. They also, apparently, do not like the decision of the government to dismantle the bureaucracy of their new schools policy to which they are emotionally devoted. They say that, if we do so, we will somehow or other erode the capacity to plan the development of education. In this legislation there is a strategic judgment by the Commonwealth government. We do not intend to micromanage Australia's school systems. The states have' full capacity to plan the development of the schooling systems in their states. The responsibility for granting registration to new schools exists in the states. It lies with the states, not the Commonwealth. It is a matter for the states to consider whether planning for new schools is required. Australian taxpayers do not need to pay for the Commonwealth to come in and try to perform the functions that the states have got a full capacity to perform. That is the level of government which is actually running the school systems. The rest of the amendments we are seeing put forward by the opposition in this debate simply reconstruct this old musty bureaucracy which failed to achieve the objectives that they wanted, which was to prevent this flow between the government and the non-government sector. The member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) in the debate said that schools could be too small to justify funding. She provided no evidence whatever to demonstrate that that was the case.

There are two major aspects which the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has referred to in his summing up speech. The first amendment seeks to preclude the government from cutting $128 million from government schools through the minister making a determination under the act to pay less than that prescribed by the formula. We heard some extraordinary logic from the minister here today. The unambiguous reality is that the effect of our amendment is to provide $128 miIIion extra for government schools. That is the difference that it makes. No amount of carrying on by the minister can disguise that reality. It is interesting to hear the minister rationalise his position. I stand by everything I said in my speech during the second reading debate. Every point that the minister made was demonstrably rebuttable. It is interesting to see the points that he fails to address himself to. I made the point about the reduc. tion in FAGs that has been imposed on the states on top of which this is a further impost. He talks about this windfall that the states have had over the years in terms of this enrolment shift. If you are going to talk about that, you cannot divorce that consideration from a broader consideration of what has happened to general revenue assistance to the states. We have had periods in the last decade where general revenue assistance-FAGshas been cut quite substantially over successive years. I absolutely reject that rationale. Dr Kemp-Who cut them? You cut them.  trying to say that there has been a windfall; what I am saying is that it is not possible to argue that there has been that sort of windfall. The minister also says that per capita funding of government school students is going to improve. The other point that he does not address is the fact that these savings, which are said to be realisable as a result of that shift from the government to the nongovernment sector, are based on an average cost comparison. That is simply not relevant for this particular purpose. The New South Wales state government-as I am sure he would be aware-claimed that it will end up out of pocket on the basis of that adjustment alone, without even factoring in the FAGs adjustment on top of that. I stand by every proposition I put forward in my speech during the second reading debate. The amendments I have moved in this context relating to planned educational provision and trying to restore a semblance of that into the policy draw to a considerable extent on the review of the new schools policy carried out by Professor MCKinnon. There are some elements drawn from the guidelines that previously existed. Some substantial elements, particularly the overall philosophy of what we are seeking to do, draw heavily on what Professor MCKinnon had to say. The amendments we have moved here today are complex. The government will no doubt vote them down in this chamber. Over the coming period, between now and when these matters are debated in the Senate, we intend to consult extensively with all those who have got an interest in this particular policy. No doubt we will make some drafting alterations as a result of that. As a result of consultation, we may choose to make some substantive alterations to what we have put forward here. I say to the minister that we do intend to press this matter aggressively. We do intend in particular to sustain our position on this enrolment benchmark adjustment. The amendments we have moved will make it as politically difficult as we possibly can for this minister to impose the $128 million cut in the level of funding for government schools compared with what would otherwise have been the case that he is seeking to implement. I can tell the minister that we will be pressing this. We will be doing everything in our power to make it as problematical and difficult as possible for him to do this. We cannot stop him-because he may just make another FAGs adjustment-but let him do that. Let him go back to the states after his government has already imposed a $1.5 billion FAGs reduction and tell them what a terrific thing it is that they think they have had this great windfall. Now, as a result of that, they are in a position to sustain a further $128 million cut in the funding available for government schools.",29
11,Dr KEMP,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (11.08 a.m.)-The shadow minister for education and youth affairs really shows that the Left of the Labor Party is just about in the same position as the Bourbons. They learn nothing and they forget nothing. I pointed out to the shadow minister that the effect of his amendment is actually to double the incentive for state governments to move students into non-government schools. This is coming from somebody who is the voice in this House for the Australian Education Union, attempting to defend the government school system and actually damaging it. He talks about a cut of $128 million to government school funding. What he is referring to is a sum of money which is half the total windfall gain to state governments as a result of projected movements over the next four years between the sectors. Those movements mayor may not occur, but what he is saying is this: that Australian taxpayers should be funding students in schools they do not attend. He is opposing the position of the government that we should fund students where they are, that funds paid by governments for education should actually go to the schools where the students are being taught. What he is saying is that, although a student has left the system, the funding for the system should be left there. That is what he is saying. This again shows the utter confusion. This is not a cut to government school funding. In fact, government school funds for the students in the system increase as a result of this policy. Dollars for every student in the government school system grow as a result of this. There is every opportunity for government schools to improve the quality of education, to cut the flow and to stabilise the situation. Under our policies, they will have the flexibility to do that. They will be in a position to tell their communities what the quality of the education is that they are offering to students. They could never do that under the previous government. That is why we are working so closely with the government primary and secondary school principals, whom the previous government never spoke to. They were so busy discussing it with their mates in the education unions that they forgot the people who were the leaders of the schools. The opposition is not a defender of the government schools. This side of the House, the Howard government, is the defender of government schools, because we are putting in place policies that will produce real quality in the government school sector. We do not have a bias between government and nongovernment schools. We will fund parents where they send their children. If they send them to the government schools, we will fund them there. If they send them to the nongovernment schools, we will fund them there. What we want to see is quality education for every Australian child. What we are hearing from the other side of the House is nothing more than the know nothing, narrow ideology that has dominated education policy in the Labor Party for the last 13 years, which is nothing more than an expression of the narrow institutional interests of the unions who support the Labor Party and who trot out their ideological compatriots to try to present themselves as if they are defenders of the system. If they knew how to defend the system, how do they explain the fact that, under the policy they are trying to reinstate, the outflow from the government schools actually increased? Why are they now moving amendments which will double the incentives for the states over and above this legislation to actually move students from the government schools into the non-government schools? We have never seen such appalling confusion. What this historic debate is demonstrating is the difference between the government on this side of the House-which is prepared to look at the facts and register them and do something to provide quality education for all Australian students-and the narrow factional institutional ideology that has dominated policy in the Labor Party when it was on this side of the House for the last 13 years.  a.m.)-I wonder whether the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) might actually address-forget the windbaggery and the rhetoric for a momentthe points that I made about why this enrolment benchmark adjustment does not have the effect that he talks about; that is, increasing the funding per student in the government school system. Dr Kemp-It does.  claim, but it is based on the presumption that the marginal saving to a state government arising from one student shifting from one sector to the other is equal to the average cost differential. Dr Kemp-We are talking about average savings.  point that you seem to fail to see-and the whole point that the New South Wales government, I assume among others, has made-is that the average cost saving is not realisable in practice. If the enrolments in a government school decline marginally, what you are probably going to see is a marginal reduction in class sizes. You are not going to see a corresponding proportionate reduction in overheads of operating a system-the high salary people who administer schools and the whole attendant state bureaucracy . You are not going to get proportionate savings there. The New South Wales state government argues that they come out $11 million out of pocket, and that is before you even take into account the impact of the FAGs cut on the capacity of states to fund government schools, which your government has imposed. What you do in these debates, Minister, is time and again fail to address the real core substantive issues. You think you can bluff your way past it by rhetoric and ideological bluster. I accuse you of being the one who engages in ideological bluster, not me.",35
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Mr Nehl)Please do not accuse me of anything and address your remarks through the chair.  Mr Deputy Speaker. Through you, I direct all that to the minister.",37
13,Dr KEMP,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (11.15 a.m.)-The shadow minister refers to the significance of the fact that his mates in the New South Wales government have put to him, for the purposes of this debate, that they cannot realise the savings on every marginal shift. We are not discussing whether a saving can be realised on the shift of one or two students; we are arguing about whether savings can be realised on the flow of students at its aggregate level between the two sectors. The states have realised very substantial savings. It is quite true that there ation between the states in their capacity to realise savings. Do not think the New South Wales government-which has failed to give its public schools the flexibility to respond effectively-has not grizzled to us about its incapacity, because of the bureaucrat regulations it has in place, to fully realise the savings. Of course the New South Wales government has made that point to us. It should get on with reform and help the public schools, the government schools, adjust to the realities of the choices that parents are making. The New South Wales government have apparently provided the opposition with a paper on the cost implications of these measures. The paper shows that the current arrangements result in windfall savings of $24.5 million a year to New South Wales for a two per cent shift in enrolments between the sectors. The New South Wales government are fully in a position to realise savings on the flows. They can say what they like to the opposition. We know that the Trades and Labour Council there are reading the riot act on an almost weekly basis to Mr Aquilina, the New South Wales minister, on his policies for education and training. It is pathetic to see this party coming in here and mouthing the nonsense that is provided to them by their union mates in this crucial area of policy. Australian parents are well able to see why so many young Australians cannot read and write. Universities are now having remedial classes in literacy. Thirty per cent of students are dropping out of secondary school before year 12 because of the lack of relevant curricula. They go straight onto the unemployment queues. These are issues the government are addressing-issues which the Labor Party had 13 years to address. Because these were utterly irrelevant matters from the point of view of the industrial strength of their union mates, they failed to do anything about it. Now the shadow minister comes in here mouthing the nonsense that is provided to him in order to defend the opposition's narrow interests against the interests of government schools and government school students. Reference was made in this debate to some arguments that were put by a Ms Watson, is a vari- who has written an article",37
14,Dr KEMP,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"No, but some of your colleagues did in the debate. In that article she contended that the government's estimates of the benchmark adjustment are conservative by around $60 million. Let me point out that Ms Watson has incorrectly, I am advised, measured the absolute increase in estimated nongovernment enrolments. Firstly, the enrolment benchmark adjustment is calculated on the proportionate shift, recognising that a share of the estimated increase in school enrolments should be expected to flow to non-government schools. Secondly, Ms Watson is wrong in saying that the enrolment benchmark adjustment will increase the incentives for cost shifting-a point, I understand; acknowledged even by the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) when she referred to cost pressures that have caused states to push students to non-governÂ­ ment schools. This is a matter on which I have already made a number of remarks in the course of this debate-remarks which reveal the nonsense of the amendment being proposed by the opposition. The member for Fremantle also referred to the shift to non-government schools as having the potential to siphon the elite and accelerate the push toward non-government schools. The fact is that my department estimates that by 1999 some 2,200,000 students will be in government schools-some 69 per cent of school enrolments-and that these students will be receiving quality education. This can hardly be categorised as 'residualisation', one of the fresh new concepts that has been thrown into this debate by the left-wing allies of the shadow minister at the table and the Australian Education Union. The government sector has been residualised when 70 per cent of students are there! We are putting in place in this legislation policies that will provide quality education. (Time expired)",37
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Mr Nehl}-It is appropriate to point out that during this debate students from the Nambucca Valley Christian Community School are in the gallery listening to the words of wisdom.  a.m.)-I would like to thank the minister for beginning to address one of the points of substance which I raised: the fact that the actual level of realisable savings will arise as a result of an enrolment shift from the government to the non-government sector. Based on what the New South Wales people have said to him, he puts a figure of $24Y2 million as the saving. Right? Dr Kemp-That's right.  Wales people concede that. The problem is that you are going to take $35 million off them in the form of the enrolment benchmark adjustment. Their argument is that the state government will end up $11 million out of pocket in terms of its capacity to fund students in government schools. Even on the per capita basis that you are talking about, your argument is not valid. It takes no account of the other factor which I persist in raising and which you persistently refuse to address-the impact on the capacity of states to fund government schools resulting from the cut in financial assistance grants to the states of $1 Y2 billion which your government has imposed.",38
16,Dr KEMP,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (11.21 a.m.)-Let me try to explain a very simple point to the shadow minister. He is saying that we should leave with the states the full average saving of $3,400 per government pupil when the pupil moves to the non-government sector instead of the $1,700 that we are actually leaving with them because of the enrolment benchmark adjustment. So we have got fewer pupils and, for every pupil who has moved out of the system, there is an additional $1,700 million. Admittedly it is not the full $3,400, but it is $1,700. Let us spread that for $1,700 amongst all the remaining pupils in the government school sector. That is more per capita than existed before the shift. There are additional dollars there for every government school student. Rather than cutting spending for government school students, there are in fact more funds in the state coffers to provide for those students. That sum of money has another role in the system as well. It is also an incentive to the states because they can make that saving and, of course, the state treasuries can come in and take that saving if they want to. The state treasuries have got twice the incentive to costshift to the Commonwealth and move students into the non-government schools if the figure is $3,400, which is what the shadow minister wants it to be. We would like that figure to be $1,750, and we would like to see that money go from the states to improving the quality of government schooling in the states. So his argument that government school students are worse off is utterly fallacious. There are more funds there as a result of the financial consequences of that shift and the savings the states make, but he wants to double the incentive for the states to costshift. We saw the effect of that during the period the Labor Party was in government. The flow from the government to the nongovernment schools actually sped up under the policy it put in place to slow it down. The policy was totally ineffective. His solution, because the unions tell him that and because it is left-wing ideology, is put all the bureaucracy back into the legislation, to do the same thing again. They tried it for 10 years and it did not work. He now wants to put it back and do it again. He fails to address the need for reform in the government school sector to provide the government schools with greater flexibility, to respond to parents' choices; to provide them with the diversity they want. He never put in place, and does not now propose to put in place, policies to encourage them to publish their outcomes in a way in which parents can see the quality of the education that is being offered in the government schools. They never put in place the sorts of policies the government is now proposing to put in place to give real relevant course opportunities in the senior secondary years to those students who are dropping out and going into unemployment. They did none of these things. There were no amendments to actually help build up the government school sector, to equip it to address this issue of flow. No, they are only interested in one thing: putting in place the bureaucracy, putting back the regulations, dipping again into the taxpayers' hand to duplicate state functions at the Commonwealth level. Ultimately, why? It is because the misguided people behind them-the unions and their left-wing mateswho think that in some way they are defending the government schools by this, want these policies. They have established lobby groups now to put them into place and to defend them before the Senate. Those policies did not work in the past. They will not work in the future. They have not done anything to protect the public schools. Those people are the kinds of friends you have when you are missing enemies. These are the enemies of the government schools. Do you not realise that? These are people who have actually damaged by their narrow thinking the government school sector. That is why the problem has not been solved. You listened to them for 13 years and the flow went on. It increased and it intensified, but you did nothing to stop it. Now you are to bringing back the same tired, old prescriptions. They will fail again, and that is why we will be opposing them.  a.m.)-We could go on forever with this, but I finally make the point that the most significant thing to come out of this exchange is that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training has failed to challenge the point the New South Wales government makes about the level of realisable savings. He then tried to obfuscate by saying there are still savings. The problem is that by the time he bas applied the enrolment benchmark adjustment there will be no savings. There is a cut in absolute terms and a cut in the capacity of states to fund the students in the government system.",38
17,Dr KEMP,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (11.26 a.m.)-Let me the just ask this question: how is it that the New South Wales government, of all the governments around Australia, is unable to realise these savings? Why is it that the Victorian governments, and the territory government but not what you're saying.",39
18,Dr KEMP,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"The shadow minister just said that they can realise some savings. He implied in his remark to the House a moment ago that they would actually suffer a loss because the basis of his claim is that there is a cut. He is trying to have it both ways. I understand what he is saying, and this is going to be the situation. The New South Wales government will actually realise savings out of this, but it grizzling that it cannot realise the same savings that other states can it not do that? It is because it has never put in place the reforms to the government school system which give the government school run system authorities the capacity to manage that system in a way that it can make savings when there is a shift of resources. It is bureaucratic rigidities that the New South Wales government should get on and start addressing. Do not come into this House and tell us that, because your mates in New are so inefficient they cannot manage the school system in the way the other states territories can manage their school systems, somehow or other we should change this policy. The fact is, as the shadow minister,  Baldwin), has admitted by way of intetjection, they will make savings, but they will not be as great as they would have made otherwise because they are going to have to share them embodies. with us. That is an incentive for them to get on with reform, to actually put the governa.m.)-I ment schools in the situation where they can compete effectively and where parents can the government schools offering a really good option for their students. I believe there is real quality in the governSchools, ment school systems. I do not have this that the left wing of the Labor Party and the unions have-that, unless you surround the government school system with a wall of bureaucratic regulation, the outflow will continue ad infinitum and the system will be residualised. What message does this Australian parents about the quality of the education in the government school systems? It tells them that, unless some artificial barrisome ers are put in place, of course parents are going to leave. That message to Australian parents about the quality of education in the government schools is totally false. There is outstanding education and outstanding innovation going on in the government school sectors. We are working closely with the principals of the primary and secondary government schools around Australia to make sure that our reis forms to help children become literate, to help them get the training that leads to jobs, will realise. Why can actually work. We are doing something that has not been done for 13 years: talking to the people who the systems. It is time for the Labor Party to wake up that its small coterie and clique of ideological mates, to whom it has listened for the the last 13 years and who have doomed it to failure by their advice, should now be shunted off into the background. They should start talking and listening to the people who actually have the interests of the government South Wales schools in their hearts. If they did that, they would not put up these and nonsense amendments, we would not be debating them now and the schools around Australia, government and non-government, would not be left in the state of uncertainty that the opposition is now leaving them in about the $14 billion of increased funding they will be getting over the next four years and the 17 per cent increase this legislation",39
19,Mr MCCLELLAND,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Barton) (11.30 did not intend to rise at this stage of the debate, and I am aware that it has been see to-ing and fro-ing for a while. However, I have been prompted to rise from my seat by the constant reference the Minister for Vocational Education and Training view (Dr Kemp) has made to the opposition's reaction being one motivated by the left wing of the Labor Party and the unions. I am not sure how the minister would characterise or typecast my fitting into that category. Mr O'Keefe-He wouldn't be concerned; give to he'd just pass the label anyway.",40
20,Mr MCCLELLAND,SECONDARY EDUCATION,"Yes, I think that is right. It is very convenient and easy to fill up speaking time by retreating into hollow rhetoric-and it is, indeed, hollow rhetoric. In the next few months the minister will find himself receiving an inundation of representations from parents and teachers. Those teachers mayor may not be members of the relevant teachers unions. I am not sure of the union coverage of teachers in public schools, but I think he will find that the representations come from both teachers who are and teachers who are not members of unions. To typecast the fact that concerns are either leftwing motivated or trade union motivated is shallow and offensive. The fact of the matter is that in his second reading speech in this House the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), on behalf of the minister now in the House, stated: Against this background, the government has decided to preserve for the Commonwealth 50 per cent of net recurrent savings from students shifting from the government to the non-government sector. It is preserving for the Commonwealth, preserving for consolidated revenue. There is no suggestion that the 50 per cent so preserved will be redirected into the public education system. Indeed, that is the thrust of these amendments. If one were to read the minister's comments in this debate, one would assume that was to be the intention; that is, that the 50 per cent preserved would be redirected to public education. If that is the intention, it should be made clear in the bill-and it most certainly has not been made clear in the bill. Indeed, from the second reading speech, it will be preserved for consolidated revenue. I believe the minister can anticipate that in the coming months he will be receiving many representations from other states when they find out the effect this bill will have on them. Of course, a state government cannot make a saving every time a student moves from the public sector to the private sector. They will still need to maintain their infrastructure. Just because a class size reduces from 29 to 28 does not mean that you sack the teacher. But it will mean that there are more composite classes. It will mean that there is a reduction in classes offered, as a number of courses will have to be discontinued. It will mean the removal of a number of additional benefits which help kids in public schools to adjust in many ways. For example, access to sporting and physical education facilities may have to be removed. If the minister is saying, 'This is what flexibility is available,' what he is talking about is compelling state governments to remove the standard of education of kids in public schools. If he is saying that, he should be honest: flexibility means cutting back standards. If the minister cuts back standards, there will be a massive increase in the exodus from public schools to private schools-and we stand by our comment that the public school system will be very much residual.

NA NA BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 September, on motion by Dr Kemp: That the bill be now read a second time.  a.m.)-This bill is a very slim volume. All it does is change several numbers in the schedule. It is a slim but fairly important bill the numbers it changes relate to the quantum NOES of funds to be provided for vocational education and training for 1996, 1997 and 1998. The VET Funding Act, which this bill amends, provides the great bulk of funding for vocational education in this country and we see some significant changes. When set against currently legislated amounts, the bill increases funding for 1996 by $13.4 million and reduces it for 1997 by $58.6 million. What underpins these changes? The second reading speech, which runs to about half a page in length, certainly does not provide us with much enlightenment on that score. It simply points out that the 1997 amount still exceeds the 1996 amount by $10.6 million, notwithstanding the reduction on amounts already legislated. This typifies the presentational approach of this government as it seeks to minimise the impact of its cuts to education. Whether it be higher education, schools or vocational education, the approach is to focus on year to year variations rather than on the only relevant comparisons if we are to judge the impact of this government's deciPAIRS sion; that is, the comparison with what already sits in the forward estimates. What does underlie the funding changes? As I understand it, the change for 1996 simply reflects the impact of price changes and as such is innocuous. However, 1997 is a somewhat different story. The difference between the currently legislated 1997 amount and that proposed in this bill reflects two budget measures in particular: the elimination of the five per cent real growth provided by the previous government and the imposition of a five per cent efficiency dividend on TAFE funding. By examining legislation like this we start to get a more realistic sense of this government's ballyhooed commitment to vocational education. According to the portfolio budget statement, these two measures cut vocational education by $91 million and $66 million respectively over the four years of the forward estimates. This, together with other savings measures, such as cuts to ANTA, comfortably exceeds the additional funding being made through the modem Australian apprenticeship since and traineeship system. That is before you factor in the massive cuts to labour market programs, which I will have more to say about in a minute. It is interesting to note that T AFE is being expected to absorb an even bigger efficiency dividend than other Commonwealth own purpose outlays and specific purpose payments. The general impost is three per cent in the first year with an additional one per cent applied cumulatively for each succeeding year. T AFE is being expected to cop a five per cent cut from the very first year. In fact, the amount specified in the vocational education and training measures table in the portfolio budget statement is the additional slug to T AFE over and above that on other areas through the general efficiency dividend on Commonwealth own purposes outlays and specific purpose payments. Where is the axe to fall? According to the department, the impact will be split between recurrent and capital activities. I am informed by the department that in the recurrent area the main cuts will likely be in the funds available to ANTA for national projects and interstate cooperative projects-the former to be almost halved, according to a chart I have been given by the department entitled 'Pre1i-inary planned expenditure 1997 VET funds', and the latter to be cut to zero in 1997, from $10 million in 1996. There will also be cuts in total capital $227,644,000 to $200 million. Obviously cuts of this sort will have a significant impact. You have to take into account the impact of these sorts of decisions when making overall assessments of what the government is doing in this area. A variety of things is being funded under national projects. I do not believe that final decisions have yet been made as to which national projects are likely to be affected. I have a list of things which are funded under national projects. There is a whole variety of activities at a national level that relate to research, things like research and evaluation, training market development, national vocational education and training system development-and that includes some equity measures and curriculum development. Just exactly what the impact of these changes will be remains to be seen. Likewise, I am advised by the department that interstate cooperative projects are going to be substantially affected by this reduction. This includes a whole range of activities which take place generally in close proximity to state borders. Therefore, it is considered to be appropriate that the projects be implemented through a cooperative arrangement between states, rather than any particular state assuming responsibility. I have a list of interstate cooperative projects. The proposition is that funding for this area will fall to zero and, I understand, be replaced by bilateral arrangements between the states. It seems to me there must be some risk that some worthwhile activities are going to be sacrificed. An example of the sorts of things that are funded under this arrangement is the cross-border Gold Coast-Tweed Heads project. This is a joint New South WalesQueensland project which provides for the delivery of training in office studies, retail, travel, hospitality, fashion marketing, computing, business, Aboriginal and disability studies in the cross-border areas of Queensland and New South Wales. That costs the best part of $1 million .. There is also the Wide Area Learning Project which is, again, a joint New South from Wales-Queensland project. This involves delivery of services to isolated and disadvantaged communities with little or no previous access to further education and training. There is a whole list here. I will not go through all of them, but those are a couple of examples of the sorts of things which are funded under this particular program. It remains to be seen the extent to which those cooperative crossborder activities will be picked up by bilateral arrangements between the states. Obviously, the cuts in capital funding are also quite significant. TAFE capital covers T AFE buildings, child-care centres, general equipment, skills centres and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander capital projects. I am not sure where the brunt of the reductions in capital funding is likely to fall but, again, it seems inevitable that some worthwhile activities are going to lose out. That is the impact of this bill. As I said, is a very slim volume-just one sheet which changes two or three numbers in a schedulebut what underlies it and what it reflects is the impact of some of the government's decisions that are designed to cut costs. When you take into account all these cuts and look through the budget measures table as it relates to the vocational education and training program within the DEETYA portfolio, then you do not get the sort of increase in commitment to this area that the government likes to trumpet. The additional MAATS funding is there, but it is exceeded by the cuts that have been made in this sort of area. At this point I think it might be useful to review where things have gone in the vocational education and training area in recent times. If you were to listen to this government's rhetoric, you would think that everything worthwhile originated as a result of the current minister's initiatives. Things like reform of the entry level training system, the introduction of vocational education into schools-all these activities, in so far as the Commonwealth is involved, you would think were solely the result of the great beneficence and wisdom of the present Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. In actual fact, there has been quite a deal policy development and implementation in this area over the past few years. Clearly, it is predominantly a state responsibility but in recent times, particularly under the former Labor government, the Commonwealth has assumed a greater role in ensuring the coordinated development of our national vocational education and training system. Throughout its life, the Labor government paid considerable attention to this area, but particularly so since about 1990. Honourable members will recall in the late 1980s the federal government undertook a major review of higher education, leading to the production of a white paper and a green paper. Those decisions resulted in a major boost to funding to higher education and a major expansion in the system. Perhaps one of the valid criticisms that might be levelled against what we did in government was that we did not adopt a sufficiently holistic and it integrated approach to the development of tertiary education. In retrospect, we should not have necessarily done that higher education exercise in isolation. There is no doubt that with the end of the binary system in higher education and the incorporation of more and more types of vocational studies, there is a degree of overlap between what higher education does and what vocational education does. The sort of training and education that is provided in TAPE colleges overlaps to an increasing degree with university courses in areas like police studies, information technology and business studies. There is a great deal of overlap and it is not entirely clear where the boundary between those two sectors should be. An interesting survey was conducted recently involving school leavers. It showed a considerable degree of confusion on the part of many schoolleavers about what the respective roles of the systems are. Students had the opportunity to look at prospectuses of courses in the sorts of areas that I have mentioned, offered by TAPEs on the one hand and universities on the other. They really could not see a clear, logical distinction between them, apart from the notion that university studies are in some sense more prestigious. of So, at the time, we should have thought more about these relationships. In so far as there was a flaw in our policy making processes at that point, it was well and truly addressed from about 1990 onwards, when a number of major reviews in the vocational education area were undertaken. In the first instance, we had the Finn review of post-compulsory education and training for young people. That was a major undertaking, the result of which was that the government and the states committed themselves to achieving certain key targets for participation by young people in post-compulsory education and training by the year 2000. The idea was to try to make it almost universal for young people leaving school to receive some worthwhile training or education after the compulsory years. The Finn review was really a major galvanising event that led to a good number of other commitments and decisions by government. In the One Nation statement back in 1992, the former government agreed to commit itself to a major expansion and enhancement of vocational education. We committed ourselves to provide an additional $70 million in growth funding each year for several years to underpin a new national framework which was to be embodied in the creation of ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority. It was given substantial responsibility for the overall coordination and development of vocational education in Australia. Another related activity was the so-called key competencies exercise, undertaken by a committee chaired by Henry Mayer. A bit further down the track was the work of the Employment and Skills Formation Council, which was part of the NBEET structure chaired by Laurie Carmichael. It considered how you might go about modernising in a comprehensive way the entry level training system. A very important set of proposals came out of that, originally termed the Australian vocational certificate training system but later shortened to the Australian vocationbeing done. al training system. It envisaged a thoroughly modernised system of entry level training, much broader than the traditional apprenticeships and existing traineeships. There would be an attempt to get into industries which are currently poorly serviced by entry level training arrangements and to redevelop the courses to put them on a competency basis, which is absolutely crucial. The Labor government went about undertaking a number of measures to give effect to these sorts of propositions. At the time of the change of government, a range of activities was in hand. There was a broad national framework and agreement on how the Australian vocational training system should be progressed. A major body of work was being undertaken under the auspices of ANTA to redevelop courses and curricula to make them consistent with AVTS principlesdeveloping a competency basis and developing a more flexible set of arrangements so that courses could be more flexibly delivered in contexts other than the traditional college environment, which obviously goes to the delivery of training in workplaces and in schools. The next significant development was the Working Nation statement. It gave considerable attention to entry level training, introduced the national training wage, and created Nettforce and the network of industry training companies, which had the involvement of a variety of players in industry and was designed to encourage the expansion and establishment of entry level training arrangements in new areas. Contrary to what the current minister would have us believe, a significant amount of attention was given to how to get vocational education options intoÂ· schools. The former government committed $38 million to the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation, which was designed to support initiatives to provide vocational education and work experience for school students. The jobs pathway guarantee was another significant initiative which aimed to smooth the transition from school to work. There was a range of things Mr Aquilina, the New South Wales education minister, told me recently that some 40,000 students in New South Wales schools are undertaking vocational studies. So it is not as if this whole area had been neglected. Having said that, I think that what the current .minister is doing by strengthening vocational education in schools is good. I support it. When I made the point in the education debate about the $20 million a year being applied to MAATS-modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system-in schools, I was not wanting to be churlish. While it is not new money in one sense-in effect, money is being earmarked that already exists in the vocational education program-it is an appropriate priority to develop these school based apprenticeships and traineeships. What is being done in that area is an initiative of which we would be broadly supportive. I simply wish to make the point that it is not as if we, when in government, had disregarded this area. It is an important area, and we were giving it more attention. It could be said that we should have done it a lot earlier. That applies to all Australian governments. We have never in the past gone down the route of trying to develop the kind of structure that exists in Germany and some northern European countries where a comprehensive suite of vocational options in schools is provided. We are going to have to move more and more in that direction given the much higher retention rates in the last two years of school. We have to develop appropriate options. There is a range of issues about the right way to properly provide and properly integrate vocational options in schools. That said, it is an important direction. It is good that it is being pursued. Turning to entry level traineeships, again, the current government seeks to disparage a lot of what was done here, particularly the Working Nation, entry level training initiatives. It is interesting that the report of the evaluation of Working Nation that was issued earlier this year, which looked at all the different Working Nation initiatives, was pretty positive on the whole about what was done in the entry level training area. It made the point that things were slow to get started in the 1994-95 year, but it also made the point that that had largely been corrected and the number of traineeships was pretty much on target for 1995-96. Page 73 of that report, talking about the entry level training initiatives associated with Working Nation, states: Traineeships are expanding into new industries and occupations, for example, as a proportion of all commencements, commencements in manufacturing and finance, property and business services expandit ed considerably between 1993-94 and 1995-96. Many employers, often those who have never taken on a trainee before, are taking up traineeship packages. They are particularly interested in packages delivered entirely on the job. It goes on to say: Employer acceptance is vital for the success of traineeships. Employers who have taken on trainees are quite positive in their attitudes to the system and individual trainees. Some have described the trainees hip system as an excellent program that deserves much better publicity and promotion. There were some significant achievements as a result of Working Nation in this broad area of entry level training. Once in a while it would be nice if the present minister were to give credit for that. The current government and the current minister are pursuing a range of initiatives in this area, most of which we would broadly support, possibly with some reservations in some areas. I understand that there is a good deal of work going on to try to rationalise the whole system of recognition of courses and to get a better relationship between courses that are developed and the competency standards which are developed by the national training bodies-the ITABS. I think that is important. It is envisaged that the ITABS will have a greater role, not just for developing the standards but also for areas such as curriculum development, recognition and so forth so that total packages can be developed with the ITABS much more in the driver's seat. By and large, I think that is good. We support that sort of direction that the current government is taking. Another important aspect is the so-called user choice concept where you try to achieve a greater degree of relevance to the training provided by industry needs. This is something that we were pursuing in government too. In fact, last year in government we had secured broad agreement from the states to the basic concept of user choice, and a number of pilot projects were in the process of being pursued. This has the potential to yield benefits if it has the result that we end up with training being provided by a variety of providers that are properly attuned to industry needs. The one reservation I have about it-and I think is a significant reservation and it has to be properly addressed-is that we do not end up with industry driving the whole thing to too great an extent. The fact is that our vocational, education and training system is about doing more than meeting the needs of particular firms. It is about providing broad generic competencies and capabilities that will serve people well throughout their working lives. We do not want people being provided with training which is very specifically attuned to the needs of particular employers. The way the policy framework is being developed, as I understand it, there ought to be safeguards against that. We will obviously be carefully monitoring that to make sure that that eventuates and that we do not end up with a situation where, as a result of user choice, public funds provided for vocational education and training end up being just another kind of industry subsidy. It is very important that the purposes of our system are broader than that. The last matter that I would like to comment on in the time available is the proposed cuts to labour market programs. This interacts with what I might term the mainstream vocational education and training system in a number of ways. The first point I would make is that we do not accept the rationale that the government has put forward for those cuts. They are very substantial cuts-about $1 Y2 billion over the forward estimates years. That will have a very severe impact on the prospects of some of the most disadvantaged people in our society. The point of labour market program interventions is to avoid the creation of a large underclass of people who are more or less permanently alienated from the labour market and alienated from the world of work, where we have a situation where unemployment becomes a generational thing passed on from one generation to the next. We have to avoid that. A very central part of the rationale for labour market program intervention of the scale that we undertook was to avoid precisely that kind of scenario. The government, in seeking to justify the cuts, has made reference to the evaluation of Working Nation that was done by the department. I have read that evaluation. It does not support the government's conclusion, in my opinion. The government has taken the fact that this report has drawn attention to a range of shortcomings in the way some of these programs were being implemented as a justification for a massive cut. That does not follow. In fact, the evaluation report says in terms of the impact of these sorts of programs on the long-term unemployed, it is simply too early to make a proper evaluation. It proposed a considerable amount of further research in order to get a better sense of what the long-term impacts are. Even if you are looking for cuts, it seems entirely premature to be carving up Working Nation on the basis of a report which specifically says that it is too early to reach definitive conclusions about the impact of the Working Nation programs. We never disputed the need to finetune and change substantially in some cases the way these programs are implemented and structured. This is an area where, as a nation, we do not have a great deal of experience. Labour market program intervention on this sort of scale is quite new and undoubtedly there were mistakes made in the way many of these things were being implemented. That does not warrant throwing the baby outÂ· with the bathwater. We continue to maintain that programs of this sort have a very important role to play. We are seeing flowthroughs from the cuts in labour market programs to more mainstream vocational education. The New South Wales minister, whom the present minister for vocational education was disparaging about half an hour ago, has drawn attention to the impact on TAFE institutes of these cuts in labour market programs. Cuts in TAFE staff, and consequential reductions in TAFE infrastructure flowing from the non-availability of substantial amounts of labour market program funding, are going to be quite significant. In the Sydney Morning Herald on 7 October 1996, the New South Wales minister said: T AFE institutes have estimated the cuts to labour market programs over the next four years will cost each of them between $2 million and $6 million this financial year, and put at risk 330 full-time teaching positions. Institutes in Sydney's west, where about 41 labour market programs were operating last year, would lose 914 student places, while institutes on the North Coast would lose 2,777. The State Government estimates 40,000 of the lost places would be outside Sydney. There is an important flowthrough effect onto that the mainstream vocational education training system. This is in addition to the major detrimental social impacts of eliminating this form of assistance which, as I said, is crucial if we are to avoid the creation of a national underclass of unemployed and unemployable people. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) is of the opinion that the vocational education and training system has an increasingly role in providing Australia's young people with skills appropriate to the changing place; and (2) condemns the Government: (a) for proposing substantial cuts in expenditure which will hamper the vocational education and training sector in fulfilling this role; and (b) for clearly failing to meetits election commitments to 'continue to support a strong and effective TAPE sector' and 'to ensure that the network of T AFE institutions, especially in rural areas and regional tres, will not be undermined'.""",40
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT, ment's Is the amendment seconded?,48
22,Dr LAWRENCE,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,48
23,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"One of the saddest things about Labor's 13 years in office was how they neglected young Australians. Over the past years, the number of apprenticeships has fallen from approximately 62,000 to 50,000, the lowest in 30 years. It is little wonder youth unemployment hit over 50 per cent in some areas. My interest in education stems from my background as a teacher. In my maiden speech to the House I emphasised the areas. importance I place on education, particularly vocational education. The previous Labor government seemed content to keep young people at school until year 12 without any real consideration for their needs or desires. I believe young people should be able consider their future path at year 10 and able to apply to do an apprenticeship or TAPE course, or enter the work force or enterprises continue to year 12. Whatever these young people decide, we as a government should make it as easy as possible for them. Young people who choose to enter the force will quickly learn the work ethic that full day's work is required if one is to earn full day's pay. They would learn that some aspects of their job must be done whether they like it or not. They would also learn there is a great feeling of self-achievement after completing a day's work. Young people who choose to enter an apprenticeship would learn these ethics on top of their trade skills .. , By the time they reached 18, they would have vital begun to understand about the working world. Unfortunately, the current system has put off worktoo many employers who see it as rigid and complex. As a consequence, many young people are left unemployed with no prospect of obtaining work. We need to redevelop the training ethos in Australia and in Australian employing industries. As the government, we will promote the value of investment in further education and training. We will be providing assistance for centhose who wish to access education and training opportunities. The previous governindenture system for apprentices was far . too complex. Apprentices spent large blocks of time at college. Many of the employers in my electorate complained of this because, when tendering, particularly on construction type jobs, they were unable to plan and price their jobs because they were not sure whether they would have their six apprentices available. The system was unattractive to small and medium business because of the burden of paperwork and the that impost placed on employers to organise the TAPE courses for their apprentices, and also the inability for apprentices to move easily between states, particularly in the border But now, under the coalition, there is some good news about apprenticeships. A key objective of the government is to provide real jobs for young people. The modem Australian to apprenticeship and traineeship systembe MAATS-will provide individuals with the a opportunity to obtain world-class skills and with training that meets their needs and contributes to their future income. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1996 provides for work a total of Commonwealth contributions of a $891 million for vocational education and a training in 1997 which includes $70 million in growth funds. This bill increases spending on vocational education and training in 1997 by $10.6 million and provides savings by reducing funding against forward estimates for all Australian National Training Authority programs and withdrawing the five per cent real growth which had been built into the Australian National Training Authority based on recurrent grants. The bill also appropriates funding for 1998 for both general purpose and eligible off-the-job training. The Howard government has already announced increased funding for apprenticeships in the federal budget. Over the next 12 months the government will provide almost $260 million to employers of apprenticeships and trainees through an incentive payments and wages subsidy. Over $1,700 million will be provided for this purpose over the next four years. As a result of the government's new income support scheme, the wages of apprentices and trainees will be guaranteed at a higher level than unemployment benefits. The guaranteed wage will increase the opportunities for many young people to move off unemployment benefits and into quality training in a new apprenticeship or traineeship. Under the new arrangements, every apprentice and trainee will be able to receive at least the current national training wage minimums. It will also give apprentices and employers the flexibility to choose the best package of working and training. The new guaranteed wage is a key element of the Howard government's new modem Australian apprenticeship system. The government is overhauling Australia's training system to provide business and trainees with more flexible, responsive and simple training systems. The wage guarantee will apply to apprentices and trainees employed under the Australian workplace agreements or certified agreements. The minimum take-home pay levels for apprentices and trainees will be $128 per week for 16-yearolds, $158 per week for 17-year-olds and $195 per week for people 18 years and older. The maximum unemployment benefit for a single person living away from home at present is $116.05 for people 16 to 17 years, $128.35 for people 18 to 20, and $160.10 for people aged 21 or more. This commitment will provide a better alternative for young Australians than living on unemployment benefits. More apprenticeships will lead to more real jobs. A major boost for Australian businesses and for job opportunities for young Australians is a $500 million nationally supported funding arrangement for increased business ownership of the training system. The arrangements enable businesses and their apprentices and trainees to use the training program of their choice. User choice is a key element of the modem Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system. This simple, flexible and responsive training system is a landmark decision that will modernise training programs and help give Australian businesses a competitive edge in international markets. A meeting of state and territory training ministers in Brisbane voted unanimously to fully implement the user-choice system from 1 January 1998. Each state and territory is committed to the processing of these arrangements during 1997. Young Australians deserve a fighting chance and this government is delivering on its election promises. The only way to create real jobs is to involve small and medium business. The new apprenticeship plan will include a system of incentive payments to be targeted to small and medium sized businesses to encourage them to recruit apprentices and trainees. From 1 December 1996, employers will be eligible for a commencement payment of $1,250 for each apprentice or trainee. A bonus payment of $250 for each apprentice or trainee taken above the previous year's intake will also be available to small and medium sized enterprises. An additional progress payment of $1,250 will be made where a trainee or apprentice progresses to a higher skills level. I must congratulate the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) on his initiative to contract job brokers to help schoolleavers secure employment. The job pathway program aims to smooth the school-to-work road for 65 per cent of school students who do not go on to full-time education. This program will provide thousands of schoolleavers with real opportunities to secure full-time employment and build a rewarding career. For too long, students who did not go on to tertiary education had few options. Now, the job and training void will be filled with many exciting options. The government's training reforms will lead to real jobs for thousands young Australians and reduce Labor's legacy of youth unemployment. The job pathway program is another part of the federal government's overhaul of Australia's $3.7 billion training system. Initial funding of $5.9 million in the next two years will be used to implement the program from 1997. Under the scheme, job brokers will be able to tender for government funds to secure suitable employment for school leavers. Public and private training providers, community organisations, and public and private employment agencies are some of the groups that will be eligible to tender for funds. brokers will liaise with students, schools and local businesses to link school leavers with appropriate employers. The program will strengthen the link between schools, local busipesses and the general community. Schools playa vital role in preparing young people for employment and it is crucial that they are linked with local businesses to ensure young people's employment needs are met. Within the electorate of Lilley, Nudgee College has developed a range of vocational offerings for students in their senior years secondary school. Nudgee College proposes a flexible curriculum which will enable the school to meet a variety of learning styles its students. Schools like Nudgee College realise that massive youth unemployment, changing industry needs and altered societal expectations mean schools have to modify their traditional approach to the post-compulsory years of schooling. The college stresses that vocational education needs to be responsive and the school needs to be given the option to work as a private provider of vocational education and training in its own right. With regard to post-compulsory education, Nudgee College is guided by the following principles: industry and community consultation, a structured work experience and industry placement, entry level training for students, employability of students, and valuing a variety of career paths for students. Nudgee College has adopted workplace learning as a valuable learning experience for its students. The students in the vocational education of program are encouraged to go into the work force one day each week during the school year. They argue that assessment in the workplace needs to be recognised as a valid method of assessing the application of vocational skills. I applaud the work being done at Nudgee College and, as a government, we must encourage secondary schools to enter into partnerships with TArn, private providers and industry to ensure that courses on offer to school students meet the skill requirements of business and industry and provide credit transfer to further training and education. I TheÂ· will support Nudgee College and other schools interested in developing appropriate vocational education programs every step of the way. Another beneficial training initiative in the electorate of Lilley is the development of an integrated race training centre. Lilley is known as the racing capital of Queensland. Within the electorate fall most of south-east Queensland's major race tracks. Almost 1,000 thoroughbred horses, a big percentage from Queensland owned and operated stud farms, of are trained within the electorate, with the suburbs of Hendra, Hamilton and Ascot also providing a traditional base for the stabling of for horses in south-east Queensland. The racing industry is strategically important to Queensland. It is the state's fourth largest industry and contributed $404 million to the state's GDP in 1990-91 and it directly employs 23,000 people. I would like to take this opportunity to stress my support for the development of this integrated race training centre. This centre for thoroughbred, harness and greyhound training is the first essential step in promoting the local racing industry and establishing it as a centre of excellence in the South Pacific rim. It is important that the Queensland racing industry remains world competitive. The centre will contribute to this by expanding the industry's skill base through education and supporting a more structured approach to training, health, research and management. The export potential of the project has already been demonstrated with the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre already marketing the courses in Asia. The manager of the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre, Mr John Graham, says the project will foster exports in the trades and services areas of the racing industry, enhance regional business development opportunities and create world-class training and research facilities. The Queensland climate is perfect for yearround racing. Students will be afforded many opportunities as part of their program to experience the racing industry throughout Australia, including specially designed excursions to the Magic Millions on the Gold Coast, the Sydney Easter Carnival, the Winter Carnival in Brisbane and the Melbourne Cup Carnival. The courses run by the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre utilise the expertise of leading personnel associated with the breeding and the racing industry. Foreign students are able to study English at the same time as they undertake their vocational course. The intake of 57 Japanese students in January 1996 has been very successful. These students have already contributed almost $2 million to our economy and helped reduce the cost of training for our own students. Best of all, these foreign students are excellent advocates for promoting our racing industry. It is estimated that within the next five to 10 years at least 10 new racetracks will be opened in China alone. This will require the purchase of more than 10,000 horses and expanded infrastructure in a country with no racing expertise. We, therefore, have the opportunity to educate people who will eventually become influential in the South-East Asian, Chinese and Japanese racing industries. This strong network can only benefit the Australian industry in terms of racing, thoroughbred breeding and tourism. Already 50 per cent of foreign students are indicating they would like to stay and study advanced courses in Australia. Finally, the development of an integrated racing training centre in south-east Queensland with the support of the Queensland Racing Industry Training Centre will be an excellent platform for the Australian racing industry to seek out further markets in South East Asia. A competitive training system is vital to Australia's future prosperity. The government's apprenticeship plan will create real, lasting jobs for young Australians instead of trying to hide the problem of youth unemployment. This plan will provide the solution. Too often under Labor young Australians completed one training course after another with no chance of getting a job at the end of them. Labor was more interested in juggling the unemployment figures than actually fixing the problem. The government's focus on apprenticeships will help create jobs by delivering new types of apprenticeship and other quality training qualifications for existing and emerging industries; updated and modernised apprenticeships in traditional areas; school based apprenticeships for young people, especially for those not going on to university or full-time TAFE; more multiple workplace apprenticeships and traineeships through group training companies; off-the-job training chosen by the enterprise and the trainee; and expanded training opportunities for regional Australia. I have no hesitation in commending this bill. to the House.",48
24,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by the member for  Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1996. In doing so, like the member for Sydney, I express my concern about the intent of the bill and wish to speak about the importance of education and training for the purposes of creating meaningful job opportunities of a long-term nature for young people across the length and breadth of Australia at the moment. In considering that, can I say that, unfortunately, the intent of the bill before the House at the moment is very much in conflict with that the objects of the second reading amendment moved by the member for Sydney. The intent of this bill is to enforce the government's decision-and it is a real bad decision when you consider the high level of youth unemployment at the moment-to slash Commonwealth grants to the states for vocational education and training. I listened with interest to the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace). The member for Lilley ought to read the fine print of the bill currenta ly before the House. I know members of the government have difficulty in reading the fine print at the moment, especially with respect to their code of ministerial practice. It seems that that difficulty also applies to the bill before the House. This bill really breaches all the government's rhetoric in the lead-up to 2 March about wanting to do something positive to tackle youth unemployment in Australia. The situation has become even worse since 2 March. I refer in passing to the employment figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics just a week ago for the month of September. Not only did we lose 31,400 full time jobs in a month-not an inconsiderable number of jobs-but youth unemployment has now blown out to 28.1 per cent. That is the national figure. It is worse in some regions and some suburbs of metropolitan Australia. I suggest that, if the member for Lilley is concerned about the needs and aspirations of young people, she ought to consider the fine print of the bill and consider the fact that the current budget strategy of the government is a no-jobs budget. It offers no hope to young people with respect to job opportunities and it really reduces their opportunities to pursue realistic training aimed at ensuring that they can open the door to meaningful long-term job opportunities. So to use the minister's .words-and they were words used recently by the minister, Senator Vanstone-it is a cruel hoax. I suggest that her bill is a very cruel hoax. I know she likes to fantasise at the moment about some of these cruel hoaxes. She has, if anything, been caught with her pants down in the Senate estimates process in recent days with respect to some of those examples she likes to layout for public consideration, but this is a factual situation. This bill really is a cruel hoax. It misleads the Australian public. The bill fails to imple- . ment the undertakings given by the government to the Australian public prior to the election and it effectively, unfortunately, also impedes cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states. I think that is very important. I believe that cooperation, be it at workplace level in the community, or in our own home, between governments is important if you want to make progress. I think there is nothing more important at the moment than making further progress in the reform and streamlining of vocational education and training in Australia. Whether the ministers responsible for vocational education and training like it or not, the real losers today are the young people. They will be the real losers if this bill is passed by the parliament. Ministers Kemp and Vanstone really have been trying recently to convey the impression, and it is a false impression, that all the states unanimously and completely agree with their so-called reform agenda-the modern Australian aprenticeship and traineeship system, MAATS-and its associated reforms. I know they are casting around looking for a new name at the moment. For some strange reason, all of a sudden MAATS is no longer acceptable as a name to the ministers responsible for this bill. I will tell you why. The truth of the matter is that not only is there no agreement with the states but the government has to search for a new name because it realises that the electorate is starting to see through its MAATS con. It ought to examine its performance with respect to these matters as a matter of urgency. I want to raise in passing today the real problem confronting Australia at the moment with respect to unemployment. It is a national problem, but it is fast becoming a major regional problem. Let's just take a couple of regions in which youth unemployment is an issue of concern. It is an issue of concern to the local council and the state members but, unfortunately, in some instances it is not an issue of concern to the federal members who represent those regions in this parliament. I will go firstly to the region of Richmond, Tweed Heads and the mid-north coast-the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales. We have a couple of new members, but I cannot hear, for example, the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) standing up and thumping the table about the question of unemployment. But when he goes back to his seat tomorrow night, he ought to think seriously about the question of unemployment, because the unemployment queue in that region has jumped dramatically. In one month it has risen from 15.1 per cent to 16.7 per cent. That means that in one month-and the region takes in Richmond, Tweed Heads and the mid-north coast-unemployment has grown. That means that 2,800 people in that region have been thrown onto the unemployment queues. That means that, unfortunately for those members-and they are new members: people like Mr Causley, an experienced politician, and the new member for Richmond, Mr Larry Anthony-they have to start explaining to their region when they return this weekend why it is that no region other than their region has had such a sharp increase in unemployment. I might say in passing that that region was one of the real beneficiaries of the Labor Party's reform agenda when it was in government, not only in respect of vocational education and training but also in respect of implementation of Working Nation. Let's go a bit further north to the electorate of Herbert. The new member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) has a lot to say from time to time, but he has not got much to say at the moment about the question of unemployment. I can understand why. Let's have a look at the unemployment figures, which were released just recently, with respect to Townsville and Mount Isa. They take in towns such as Townsville, Charters Towers, Mount Isa and Normanton. What do you find? They are onesixth of the way through a full term of government. It is not as though they have not had time, because their budget strategy is going to fix it all. Their workplace relations bill is going to fix it all. What does the member for Herbert have to explain this weekend? Unemployment is getting worse in Townsville-and I know because I am getting calls from concerned citizens in the seat of Herbert at the moment. The fact is that the member does not seem to be concerned about the issue of jobs and creating opportunities for young people. He ought to start being concerned about it, because unemployment numbers have jumped every month since July. Local unemployment was then seven per cent. It increased in August to 7.2 per cent. But it gets worse. What is the September figure? It has jumped dramatically to 8.3 per cent. So in July there were 7,600 people unemployed in that region. There has been an increase in two months to 9,600 people. Then we have the new parliamentary secretary, Mr Ronaldson. Let's just go to his region, because he does not think unemployment is a real issue at the moment. Let's just have a look at what is happening in regional Victoria-another area which really benefited from the Labor reform agenda. The Labor government cared about regional Australia. The Labor government was prepared to intervene and do something to try to reduce unemployment and give people a second opportunity in life. It did not matter what age bracket you were in, whether you were young, mature aged, unemployed or whatever. So let's go to the central highlands and the Wimmera region. I hope the new parliamentary secretary, Mr Ronaldson, is listening because he is going to have to explain to his region why it is that-in an area that includes towns such as Ballarat, Ararat and Horshamthey have lost some quite signifi-ant employers in the last couple of weeks in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. For example, they lost Holeproof at Horsham, and last week Jockey Australia announced that they are going to close down in Maryborough by the end of the year. Another 59 jobs will disappear. He is going to have to explain why, despite all the promises of the new government that it is all going to be fixed, unemployment is still rising. They have everything right: they have a reform agenda, they have a budget strategy and they have changes to industrial relations. Here is the vote of confidence by employers in that region for the Howard government's reform agenda: the unemployment queue has jumped in that region, in not two or three months but in just one month, from 10.9 per cent to 12.4 per cent. That means effectively there are, unfortunately, now 12,200 people unemployed in that region. Unfortunately for them the con has been exposed. That is why the states themselves are resisting the changes, as are the state training authorities. The passage of the bill will only make matters worse. Let us go to the large state of New South Wales. It has publicly stated, contrary to what the minister would have the Australian public believe, that it is opposed to MAATS. It has signalled its objections not only in ministerial meetings but also in the public arena so as to ensure that the Australian public understands that it is a con. It ought to be exposed for what it is: a con. The New South Wales Minister for Education and Training, Mr Aquilina, recently stated after a meeting of state training ministers that MAATS will disadvantage trainees and apprentices. He also said fairly and squarely that it will no longer deliver benefits for employers. I listened to the member for Lilley. She quoted some wage rates. Mr Aquilina produced the goods. He produced them out there in the public. He put them on the table for the people of New South Wales to have a look at and to examine the fine print. But we know they cannot read the fine print. Ask Senator Short. It even looks as if some of the people who sit in the House of Representatives, such as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), have difficulty reading the fine print at the moment. I wonder if the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) can read the fine print. They said that it means lower wages for apprentices and lower quality training. It is there in the fine print: lower wages for apprentices and lower quality training. Mr Aquilina has pointed to the fact that a survey of 500 employers was conducted in his state. What does the survey show? It shows that, contrary to what the coalition claims, cost of training is only of minor concern to employers. Correctly, what do employers want? The survey says nothing new. It might be new to members ofÂ·the government, because they do not really have an understanding of the needs of business, industry and workers. It is all hype and rhetoric to them. They really have no concern about jobs and creating opportunities for quality training. Mr Miles-You want us to go back to mickey mouse courses for the Labor Party.",51
25,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"The survey says that employers want quality training, which is exactly what MAATS will not provide. The employers want quality training, not lower wages. They want to attract decent people and ensure that they pay a decent wage. In doing so, employers want to ensure that there is quality training available to those people. Of course it hurts the member for Braddon, because he does not understand the issues or the question of quality training. The reality is that MAATS is about deregulation and about forcing the door open for unscrupulous employers: the type of people who make huge donations to the coalition's secret accounts-the blind accounts that you now want to set up to hide your investments and your securities. MAATS will water down the accreditation procedures for training. It will mean that some employers-listen to this---can utilise young workers as cheap labour. That is what it is about in some instances. Not all employers are bad. The majority of them are very decent employers. The real problem is that the intent of this bill is to open the door for that minority of unscrupulous employers who will exploit workers, especially our young, without any obligation to provide quality training. I believe there ought to beÂ· an obligation in Australia in this day and age to commit yourself, if you accept responsibility to train a young person, to providing quality training. MrMiles-You want us to go back to mickey courses for the Labor Party.",54
26,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,I can understand why the member for Braddon is running the away from the debate and trying to hide over there with the departmental advisers. Mr Miles-Mickey Mouse training courses-that's what you want.,54
27,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"It is because th- New South Wales government has exposed the harsh cuts which will occur in T AFE colleges-not the mickey mouse training that will occur if the doors are opened to some of these unscrupulous employers. Training in TAFE colleges will be undermined as a result of these changes. I do not think TAFE colleges-for example, the TAFE colleges in northern Tasmania-are mickey mouse training institutes, as the member for Braddon would have us believe. They are training institutions that we ought to be proud of. They have provided quality training-not mickey mouse training, as the member for Braddon would have you believe-for generation upon generation. TAFE institutes in areas of high unemployment-for example, in Sydney's south-westface enrolment cuts of more than 1,000. One thousand opportunities will be ripped away in an area of high need. I know about western Sydney. Like you, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, I grew up in western Sydney. I know of the need for quality training in western Sydney. Go to the Hunter. TAFE institutes in the Hunter region of New South Wales will lose more than 4,000 places. The Commonwealth cannot expect to win the goodwill of the states when it imposes cuts of this magnitude. It is no good putting out press releases pretending all the states are happy about it when they are not. The funds to be put into MAATS are much less than the government has been suggesting. This is all about the Howard government con. It is going to be exposed in this debate. The Liberal Party explicitly promised in its 'Pathways to real jobs' election policy-which has now been exposed for what it really is: a pathway to high unemployment-that direct savings from cuts to Working Nation job programs would be put into new apprenticeships and training opportunities for the young unemployed. In the weeks prior to the budget they tried to suggest-it is there to be read; go up to the library and have a look at all the media cuttings-that funds for apprentices and trainees would be trebled or at least increased by $600 million. Evidently they have trouble counting at the moment. The only things they seem to be able to count are their share interests. When it comes to the budget processes they really cannot count dollars and cents for the purpose of providing services to the Australian community. If you read the fine print of the budget process, you will find that, according to the listed outlays in the budget papers, an amount of $1.8 billion has been cut from labour market programs over a period of four years. But what has gone into MAATS? A miserable $160 million. That is the additional amount they put in. This means that national expenditure on apprenticeships and traineeships will increase to $1.7 billion over the next four years. That is not what they would have you believe in the fine print-the con. They are out there at the moment trying to suggest that there is an additional $1.7 billion in MAATS. It is not an increase. That is the amount. It is mainly expenditure previously allocated by the Labor government. There is no real increase. Labour market programs will be cut by $1.8 billion over four years and there will be a miserable increase-the con-of $160 million. So the real expenditure over four years is not an increase of $1.7 billion but actual expenditure of $1.7 billion. It is entirely made up, as I said, of expenditure previously put in place by the Labor government. I suggest that, yes, we have to be concerned about the needs of our young people, but we also have to be honest with them. This government is not creating opportunities for our young people. Unemployment is going through the roof. We lost over 30,000 full time jobs last month, despite the fact that independent economic think tanks such as Access Economics-and I know they are well known to the member for Braddon-have factored in the budget process and changes to industrial relations. What is the Christmas cheer? When we get up in December we are probably looking at an unemployment rate of nine per cent. That is the Christmas cheer. There will not be much Christmas cheer in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, an area of high unemployment as a result of this budget process, because they are really not doing much with respect to apprenticeships and traineeships. You ought to also examine the huge growth that has occurred with respect to traineeships over the last couple of years. That is the benchmark they are going to be measured by. There has been a huge improvement in the level of traineeships over the last couple of years through cooperation and the parties working through the TAFE colleges and at a workplace level. Put your reputation on the line and set a target with respect to apprenticeships and traineeships, not rhetoricreality and facts. (Time expired)",55
28,Mr TONY SMITH,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"When I heard some of the remarks of  Baldwin), I thought that some humility had entered into this debate on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill from the Australian Labor Party. The honourable member made the quite significant concession that the previous government had failed to take an integrated approach to training. In addition, we heard the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who has just finished speaking, concede-and it was a concession, as I will illuminate in a second-that the level of unemployment amongst youth now is 28 per cent. Throughout the election campaign, the Labor Party said it was seven per cent. Paul Keating said, 'It's not 27 per cent at all; it's seven per cent.' He went all over the countryside saying that it was seven per cent. So at last we have heard the truth from the Australian Labor Party that it actually is 28 per cent and not seven per cent. That figure has gone now. They were the two concessions that made me think some humility had entered into this debate, but that quickly went out the window when we heard the rest of the honourable gentleman's speech, particularly his attacks on the government in its so far short period in office. It is interesting to bear in mind some remarks the honourable gentleman made. He developed irrationalism to dizzy heights. He said to the House-certainly not tongue in cheek-that the government had all these things such as the workplace relations bill that would fix it all. Where is the bill? The bill is stuck somewhere in the Senate. It has not got anywhere and it is stuck there because of the bloody-minded attitude of the opposition. So we do not have our bill in place, a bill that would have ensured that we got rid of this ridiculous unfair dismissal law and had some choice, flexibility and freedom of association put back into the industrial relations scene so that people who did not want to belong to trade unions could opt out. He happened to say that it was something the government had not managed to change in the very short period it has been here, notwithstanding the fact that the bill is stuck somewhere in the Senate. Interestingly enough, when I went around the electorate on this issue during the election campaign and as I do now, the two biggest issues in relation to the employment of young people were the cost of labour and the unfair dismissal legislation. Wherever I went, the same story came from business people everywhere-the cost of labour, the unfair dismissal laws and the lack of flexibility. If you put all that together, you can say, 'Is that something we did? Is that something we should have fixed?' Let us have a look at some even greater statistics, more illuminative of the farcical nature of some of the opposition comments on this matter. In March 1996, 242,800 teenagers were seeking full-time employment. That was almost the same as in March 1995. Notwithstanding all the schemes the Labor Party had running to try to ensure their re-election, they still did not make an imprint in real terms in the unemployment situation over that period. Even worse is the statistic in relation to apprenticeships. The number of apprenticeships and traineeships that commenced in 1994-95 was the same as in 1984-85-10 years ago. So in 10 years they did absolutely nothing to improve the level of apprenticeships and traineeships in this country. That is of the really what we are here about. Now the member for Batman is getting into us, having been here five minutes, to try to change this mess that we have been bequeathed. He is saying, 'You should've done something. You've had the workplace relations bill. You've had these other measures and so forth.' It is absolutely perplexing logic. Indeed, it is the sort of thing that demonstrates the lack of humility. They will not say, 'We failed the Australian people felt we did.' I am particularly minded to remind the member for Batman of a few more alarming statistics since he made some reference to what we are supposed to doing in relation to the employment of young people. Industrial relations arrangements have hindered schools and local industries in creating pathways to real jobs. There are rigid restrictions on the mix of training and work students can undertake, and the consequences of those restrictions on combinations of work and training are that employers have been discouraged from providing more than one day of training a week, students have not been able to undertake apprenticeships while enrolled at school and those seeking part-time training and work under an apprenticeship, such as women returning to the have been unable to do so. So those are the restrictions that we have been bequeathed and that we are, through the policies of this government, seeking to redress, subject to bloody-minded attitude of the opposition and the Democrats in the Senate. The bill before the House sets funding levels for vocational education and training for 1998. It will be remembered that the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 gave effect to an agreement, announced by the then Prime Minister on 21 July 1992, between the Commonwealth, states and so. territories for the establishment of ANTA. The objectives of the agreement include the establishment of national vocational education and training systems, closer interaction tween industry and vocational education and training providers, an effective training market and improved cross-sectoral links. Given the concession of the member for Sydney, it appears that in those objectives there has been an inflexibility, if you like, relation to training. It is that inflexibility has not assisted with the efficacy of the ANTA system. Under the procedures that are being put in place by this government, and under the policy of the modem Australian apprenticeship and training system,MAATS, it is ensured that there will be the sort of flexibility that has been outlined by the and minister and also that has been encouraging schools and also other educational institutions in various electorates-in my own electorate of Dickson I refer to the Pine be Rivers High School-to develop a training system that is going to help people on the ground. It is no good having training unless you have something for them to go to. Sure, we need people to be better trained, but there also needs to be a job placement for those people and a work opportunity. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said last October when he spoke to ACOSS, we need a more competitive and a more efficient economy if we are to have a more compassionate society. So it gets back to the total approach of getting the economy going and having training that is directed to training people into the sort of work force, work that is in demand. In my own electorate, for example, that lacuna, if you like, in the link between trained people and available work is felt more often the than not, it seems, in the panel beating and automotive industries where it is extremely difficult to get people who are qualified in those areas of panel beating and motor mechanics whereas there is a surfeit of trained people in some of the other areas-and that is reflected particularly in the construction area at the present time. But that has been the trend, unfortunately, in the past 10 years or The trend has been to train people in the construction type areas and, unfortunately, the jobs have not been there. On the other hand, people in the technological side of training behave been hard to find. It is important, in looking at the question of training overall, to look first of all to the past. In my view, there has been demonstrated a dilution in the value of apprentices and trainees. It seems that over time we have in developed a culture in society where the value that of those apprentices and trainees has somehow been undermined. You get the culture of people saying, 'I am only an apprentice, I am only a trainee,' as opposed to someone doing a graduate course that would entitle them to a degree and letters after their name. That, I think, has been an unfortunate development in the overall economy, because that has caused people perhaps to move into the more esoteric areas and the less productive areas of our economic and social make-up. I am not trying to downgrade the social side of degrees and so forth, but we do need trained and skilled people. The fact that we are finding such a shortage of those good and highly skilled trainees and people who have come through the apprenticeship system is reflected in some examples I have struck in my own electorate. For example, in a cabinet making shop in my electorate the proprietor has had an enormous difficulty in obtaining a skilled cabinet maker. For some time he had been advertising, but the level of skill was just not what he was requiring and the person had to be let go. This went on for a period of months. Finally, a person from the United Kingdom walked into his shop and he turned out to be the best tradesman that this particular constituent had ever had. However, he was only visiting the country and, unfortunately, had to leave at the end of 12 months. The proprietor has since contacted me and sought my help with a view to getting this fellow permanent residency in this country. He showed me some of the work of this trained person and then compared it with some of the work that he had been getting from some of the other people whom he had employed and there was, it would seem, a marked difference between the work. That made me think. What has happened to training in this country? Have we devalued training? Have we lost the ability to ensure the standards that we need in these sorts of skills? When I was doing my apprenticeship it seemed to me that the people who had been trained'in Europe had a greater level of skill and a greater level of ability to impart those skills than some of the local tradesmen. I hate to say it, but that seemed to be the case. I wondered about that then, and I wonder about the fact that that seems to have continued to some degree. We must look at the levels of expertise that we have brought to this country through the migrant programand I welcome that. We must not be afraid to draw on that experience, but we also must use that experience to help us improve our own standards. We can learn a lot from the standards that have been set. Perhaps we should look harder at the training methods that we employ and compare them with the training methods of people from overseas in order to develop the expertise that we need to improve our standing here. I refer to Pine Rivers High School. An exciting program is being proposed in that high school whereby, if the program can be facilitated, the school will be developing a training program for young people who are currently completing year 10 who wish to leave school at the end of year 10 but wish to avail themselves of the facilities and infrastructure at that school. The school has an extensive training infrastructure, in particular in relation to engineering. It has lathes, milling machines, drills and shapers. It has woodworking and automotive workshops of a high standard. All of this equipment sits idle after 3 p.m. on school days, on weekends and during school holidays. Why can we not use that infrastructure to train people who are leaving school and who want to go into apprenticeships? In addition, can we not also channel young people who are unsure of where they are going and what they want to do but who can be persuaded through that program to utilise the facilities at the school and to be trained after school hours and during the evening? It is nothing new for people to be trained in the evening in apprenticeships. When I was doing part A of my marine certificate at the technical college at Yeronga, we used to train for three hours per night, four nights a week, so it is nothing new. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has visited the Pine Rivers High School. He has expressed great interest in this particular proposal. I welcome that interest and I welcome the continuing interest of the minister as the program develops. A feasibility study has already been completed. An application for aLMA grant funding through DEETYA has beenÂ· submitted, together with the study in draft form at this stage. An amount of money is being sought. A community vocational education steering committee has involved local businesses in order to utilise their expertise and combine it with the expertise of the trainers at the school to ensure that people are being trained in particular skills that are needed in the electorate. The steering committee has had a number of monthly meetings and all is going well in relation to this proposal. I trust that programs like this will be part of the catalyst for a number of programs across the country which will guide trainees into real job pathways rather than just turning trainees out onto the street after short programs, as we have seen in the past, with no real future and with nothing to look forward to but the revolving door of unemployment, and then being channelled into another scheme. In my view, the scheme that has been proposed at Pine Rivers High School will provide some answers to the serious unemployment problem. It is not an unemployment problem of our making. It is one that was bequeathed to us. The absolute rubbish that is coming from the other side that somehow or other the level of unemployment that we now face is a result of things we have done is just absurd. I commend the bill to the House and I oppose the amendment.",56
29,Mr OCONNOR,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1996 before the House reduces the expenditure on vocational education and training that is provided through ANTA. Strip the rhetoric of this government bare and what you have is a reduced commitment to vocational education training in this country. A major element of the bill before the House reduces vocational education and training grants to states and territories. It abolishes the five per cent increase in real growth funding on recurrent expenditure on technical and further education. It applies an efficiency dividend to parts of the ANTA subprogram of the DEETYA portfolio. If we roll these measures together, we have a reduction in funding to the technical and further education sector of this country. That is not all that this government has done. We observe in the budget papers cuts of $43 million in incentive payments to employers of apprentices and trainees and a massive $1.8 billion sliced off labour market programs and, under the guise of a special budget allocation to MAATS, we see the government trying to persuade this House and the Australian people that it is actually meeting the needs of vocational education and training in this country. When it went into the last election the coalition made great play of its promises to the TAFE sector in this country. It said in its election commitments that it would: . . . continue to support a strong and effective T AFE sector, that is, the publicly funded network of T AFE institutions . . . ensure that the network of TAPE institutions, especially in rural areas and regional centres, will not be undermined . . . However, what have they done in this legislation? What they have done in this legislation is violate the promise and the commitment that they gave to the Australian people at that election. They have actually reduced funding to the vocational and technical and further education sector of this country. I find it quite extraordinary that members of the government can come into this House and parade, under the guise of increased allocations in very specific areas, their concerns for elements of the education and training constituency in this country. Earlier today we had debated in this House a bill which is going to see the massive transference of resources from the public primary and secondary school sector to the private primary and secondary schools sector. What we have in this particular bill before the House is a series of measures that are going to reduce federal government funding to public TAFE institutions in this country. If we go to the particular promises, we can see that it is not just in the area of education that the government has violated its commitments to the electors of this country. We can go to regional development and we can go to the commitments they made on aged care, commitments they made in the industry policy area and commitments that they made in health. It is not a very pleasant record that you have for keeping your promises to the Australian people. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has come up with a novel way of categorising the promises. He has core promises and noncore promises. In addition, over the last few days we have seen that the Prime Minister has core standards and non-core standards. We are wondering over this side of the House what is going to be next. Do you have a core promise to education in this country and a non-core promise that you ditch at the earliest opportunity? It is an extraordinary situation that we in relation to vocational education and training whereby this government is committing itself through this bill to a reduction of expenditures on this important area of educational activity. We have heard the minister come in here, question time after question time, and tell us of the great interest that has in education and training in this country. Well, he has a funny way of showing it: he introduces a bill to this House that actually reduces expenditure in a vital area of educational activity, an area of strategic economic importance to the Australian economy and of great personal importance to young Australians who are seeking to expand their educational opportunities. Let me run through some of the cuts that the minister is making to vocational education and training in this bill. We see that there an overall reduction in VET grants to the states and territories of $66.25 million. is also a reduction in the expenditures going to the Australian National Training Authority of $12.8 million and, of course, the abolition of the five per cent real growth on base recurrent T AFE funding amounts to $91 million' over four years. As I have mentioned, in other areas where the federal government is involved in the provision of moneys to employers for training purposes this government has reduced those as well. They have hacked intoÂ· the labour market programs, in which the technical and further education institutions of this country were intimately involved through Working Nation. They have sliced $l.8 billion off those particular programs. Mr Barresi-Creating no jobs as a result.",59
30,Mr OCONNOR,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"I do not know what the honourable member is going on about. I heard the previous speaker in this debate speaking about short-term training courses that led nowhere for young people. He ought to come down into my electorate and see some of the constructive programs that enabled young unemployed people, and especially the long term unemployed, to receive very basic training that has enabled them to go on to employment. You really have to address your statements to those people because they have see been the beneficiaries of Working Nation moneys, they have been the beneficiaries of the involvement of T AFE institutions in labour market programs and, as a result, they have obtained employment. I do not think that there is anybody on either side of this House who understates the he importance of vocational education and training to Australia. It is fair to say that vocational educational training has always been a second cousin to university education. As a government in power, over a period of 13 years, we did much to redress that imbalance in perception that was out there in the community that somehow a better opportunity would be gained if a person went to a university rather than a T AFE. We still have a long way to go to make inroads on that perception, but it is very is important that we do and that young people understand that there are many pathways to There employment. Some of those will take them directly into training within enterprises in the economy; other pathways will take them into TAFE institutions and into the work force; and others will take them through university into the work force. A modern industrialised economy such as Australia demands a highly skilled work force. We need greater productivity from our existing resource base if we are to maintain the spectacular economic growth that the Labor government left this Howard government with in March 1996. We need a highly skilled work force which will enhance the capacity of the economy to change quickly to new forces of demand and new opportunities emerging around the globe. The workplace of today is a workplace that has seen the unparalleled introduction of new technologies and new production techniques. It is a more sophisticated workplace for employeesÂ· to enter and to develop their working lives in. The Australian economy has in recent years changed dramatically in its structure. The traditional sectors of agriculture and manufacturing have declined and we have seen a massive growth in the services sector: in tourism, education, banking, transport and information technology. These are the new growth areas for employment in this country, and it is very important that young people understand the underlying structural changes that have occurred and are continuing to occur in the Australian economy. I go back to my own upbringing in agriculture. We have seen massive changes to the structure of agriculture. Once upon a time in dairy farming, when you ran a herdÂ· of cows and produced milk from the farm,it would have to be done with the assistance of some six to eight people involved in the harvesting of hay and in the production of milk itself. But now the structure has changed to the point where one person, possibly two, can milk a herd of 300 cows and essentially do the hay harvesting by themselves. It has become a very capital intensive activity and the demand for labour has been significantly reduced. Of course, the demand for new management skills, an ability to handle information technology and the ability to apply new production techniques have all created a new set of demands on the agricultural work force. But we have seen a massive contraction of that work force. In the manufacturing sector we see a similar thing has occurred. My own electorate is a manufacturing centre of great significance to this nation. It has some great industriesmotor vehicles and textile, clothing and footwear industries. But within those industries in the last 15 to 20 years we have seen a massive readjustment. The introduction of new technologies, for example, in the car industry has seen the disappearance of great numbers of jobs on the factory floor. Robots now do the welding at Ford. We do not have lines of welders and lines of apprentices who are learning very important work skills. Those dramatic changes in the structure of the economy have exerted a tremendous demand for new and flexible skills,and that has put great pressure on the educational institutions, not only at the TAFE level but at the university level and the primary and secondary education level, to ensure that the young people who go through those educational institutions are equipped for the challenges that they will meet in our economy. It is in this context that Labor in government moved to massively expand the vocational education sector in this country.Â· In 1992 we saw the creation of the Australian National Training Authority, and that occurred after lengthy negotiations with the states. A major task given to ANTA was the creation of a genuinely national system of vocational education in this country, and we have walked a long way along the path to achieving that objective. To do that, we had to increase the expenditures to the sector, and it is those expenditures that the government is reducing here today. The objectives that were enshrined in the legislation which set up ANTA really are most critical when you look at the needs of the Australian economy and the need for that economy to remain competitive in a global sense. There were four main objectives. One was the establishment of a national vocational education and training system. As I mentioned, we moved quite a way down the path to achieving that in our time in office. Another. significant objective of that particular legislation was a closer interaction between industry and vocational education and training providers. In my own electorate, we have been pacesetters in achieving that interaction between industry and the primary and secondary sector and also the TAFE sector. James Harrison College, a secondary school in my electorate, has struck a very important relationship with Alcoa, with the support of the Gordon TAFE, in providing a new pathway for sections of the student body to make their way through years 11 and 12, and combine their studies on campus with off-campus work experience and training within that private company. Another particular objective of that 1992 legislation was the establishment of an effective training market. In my electorate great strides have been taken in the past 10 years in developing an effective skill providers market and now we have reached a stage where we have no equal throughout the length and breadth of this country. We have some of the best skillshares in the state of Victoria which have been recently rationalised and our public and private training providers are acknowledged to be very successful and of a very high quality. In 1994 we made further progress towards the establishment of a national vocational education and training strategy with further agreement between the Commonwealth and the states on a strategy that is set out in the document Towards a skilled Australia. However, progress along this path has been very slow and that is primarily because responsibility for VET training lies with state governments. In my electorate we have a superb institution in the Gordon TAFE. We are a dynamic region with major manufacturing industries that have potential for growth. We need a dynamic and progressive TAFE institution, and we have it. Over the last five years the previous Labor government poured enormous resources into upgrading the buildings at the Gordon T AFE and provided new premises such as the manufacturing industry training centre in Geelong. We have seen the Gordon TAFE involve itself extensively in labour market programs under Working Nation to provide training to young people in our community and. to involve itself in some very worthwhile community projects. More recently, this institution ployed. achieved a status in the .quality assurance area. It became one of the first TAPEs to undertake this program of achieving quality assurance and to achieve it. I make particularÂ· mention here of Peter Cochran, who has put in an enormous 'amount of his own skill and energy into the quality assurance program at the Gordon T AFE. One interesting feature of the local TAPE institution has been its preparedness to cooperate with Deakin University in providing a broad curriculum to the students of the Geelong region. Of course, it is an institution that has engaged itself in exporting educational services to Asia, in particular to China and Indonesia. We are very fortunate in our community to have the Gordon TAPE. May I take this opportunity to congratulate the board and the staff of the college for the excellent work they do in skilling the young people of the region to meet the changing needs of the local economy and to give the region a unique opportunity to take advantage of the growth opportunities that are occurring in the international economy.

31,Mr BARRESI,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1996 and against the amendment proposed by  Baldwin). This bill ensures the supplementation of Commonwealth funding for the vocational education and training sector. Funding for vocational education and training is appropriated under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority, is responsible for distributing Commonwealth money to provide training opportunities for Australia's young people. ANTA plays a key role in ensuring Commonwealth funding goes to where it is required. ' I have heard several speakers this morning from the opposition side make various comments and allegations with regard to vocational education and training. I will refer back to their comments in due course. Needless to say, I reject some of their allegations and some of their feigned concern for the unemUnder this bill, funding will increase in 1996 from $844 million to $858 million. In 1997 funding will decrease slightly from $972 million to $869 million. In 1998 funding will be $872 million. Although funding for 1997 is reduced, it is still $10.6 million higher than in 1996. As in other areas of government expenditure, this bill proposes some reductions but they are reductions brought about by the Beazley bankcard debt-a debt that none of us wanted but now must pay. However, the government has ensured that any reductions will have a minimal impact on training opportunities. The member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and the member for Batman (MrMartin Ferguson)-I hope the member for Batman is listening at the moment-made comments about TAPE colleges suffering because of the reduction in funding. I will share with those members from the other side, a little later on, some very interesting statistics comparing the Victorian and the New South Wales TAPE systems. The figures show how the Victorian system is able to respond to the needs of students and to the needs of business groups with less funding than New South Wales, and it has still been able to achieve It is not a matter of increasing funding in order to achieve effectiveness, it is a matter of how you restructure the TAPE system, the vocational education system, to respond to those needs. Money does not solve the problems of our society but, of course, the previous Labor government failed to understand that and we are now burdened with over a $10 billion bankcard debt. Their answer was to throw more money at it. Who pays for it? The taxpayer pays for it. What are the results? Nil. Vocational education and training funding by the government has two main objectives-,to ensure young people are trained and to ensure that the training is recognised by employers. This fits neatly into what employers are saying about the prospects of employing young people. As I have moved around the electorate and around the country, I have come across three main concerns. The first one is the risk associated with employing young people. I notice that earlier on we had some school groups here and I know that they will be taking a great interest in future employment prospects under this government. Employers have doubts because of the risks of employment. These doubts will be allayed by the workplace relations bill and by abolishing Labor's unfair dismissal provisions. To say that our policies have not had an effect on unemployment is a furphy because the bills are still in the Senate and they are being blocked. They have not had a chance to be implemented. Give them a chance to be implemented. See what happens, and then make your comments. The second concern that employers have expressed is about the cost of employment itself. Through the MAATS program and the workplace relations bill, we are offering incentives to employers to put people on. The incentives offered to small and medium sized businesses through MAATS include a commencement payment of $1,250 when taking on an apprentice or trainee, and a bonus payment of $250 per apprentice or trainee taken on and above the last year's intake. Employers will also be entitled to an additional progress payment. This is an incentive for good results. the employers. The third concern that employers have about putting young people on is the inability of our education system to prepare young people for the transition to work. At the moment, young people have two choices: they either go onto the dole queue and become unskilled or they go to university. A whole group of young people out there do not have any other choice. The honourable member for Corio said that choices are important and that we need to have pathways which will lead to more than two choices. I welcome his endorsement of that particular strategy. The government is addressing the transition from school to work through a combination of bills, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill being one of them. Once implemented and funded, the reforms to vocational education and training will ensure that there are advantages for both employers and employees. Never before in our history has the need for high quality, flexible vocational education and training been more apparent Young people are leaving school with minimal experiel1ce of work, especially in areas that require vocational expertise and technical skills. This need will not diminish. Vocational education for the 21 st century will emphasise the need for quality trammg to be conducted with the support of industry. The coalition's policy is to ensure that there is a pathway or connection between schooling and employment. In his amendment, the honourable member for Sydney says in point No.1: is of the opinion that the vocational education training system has an increasingly vital role providing Australia's young people with skills appropriate to the changing workplace; If he stopped there, it would be spot on, he then goes on to propose two other parts the amendment which I reject and will refer to later. In recent years the pathways have disappeared. Many have asked why. There are two main reasons why the pathway for our young people moving out of school into employment has gone. Firstly, secondary schools across nation are unable to prepare our young people for their working lives. For many years, until the late 1980s, Victorian teenagers wanting pursue a trades based career attended their local technical school. From there they went into an apprenticeship. Many have lamented the passing of the technical school system. certainly am one of those. I know there lot of parents in my electorate who also lament the passing of the technical school system. In her speech yesterday, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) attacked the reforms introduced by the very successful Kennett government, and thus defended the Cain and Kirner governments, which deRichmond. stroyed the technical school option. Technical schools, it was claimed, were inferior. Inferior to what? They removed a pathway, a pathway which I know the honourable member for Corio endorses-that pathway has gone. Driven by failed, left-wing ideology, state Labor governments abolished the vocational option for thousands of young Australians. Many of those people did not want to go to university. They were not academically minded and, unfortunately, the tem. dole queue was the only option for many of them. And so, when the honourable member for Batman starts bleating about the high level of youth unemployment, the only person he should look to is himself-look in the mirror and see one of the members of the Labor organisation in Victoria and former president of the ACTU that brought this situation about. A second reason why the pathway has disappeared is that, over the last few years, international and domestic pressures have and opened up the Australian economy. The in manufacturing sector-and I know that many members will agree with this-has undergone dramatic and substantial change. The pressure but of price competition, increasing costs and to government action has reduced the number of firms in the manufacturing sector and, accordingly, the number of employees. Under Labor, vocational education and training suffered. Working Nation did not deliver what it promised. The apprenticeship system was virtually abandoned under the the previous government. In recent years, the number of apprenticeship commencements has been the lowest for 30 years. It was a disto graceful performance by the former government. Labor Party representatives talk about apprenticeships and the lack of opportunities, and yet they are partly to blame. The lack of I growth in commencements is directly attribuare a table to the former government's fiscal mismanagement, the general failure of its economic policies and, in particular, its neglect of the apprenticeship system. Thousands of young people are angry and frustrated because the former government got it wrong. Prior to coming into politics, I was in charge of the Repco Training Centre in It was a very successful centre which put through a lot of apprentices, both on behalf of Repco and on behalf of other manufacturing industries. It is now owned by the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers. I recently visited that centre with one of the those parliamentary committees, and the member prefor Batman as a member of the committee was present on the day. We heard about the plight of the apprenticeship system and the difficulty of getting people through the sysThe former government failed; they have got nothing to complain about in terms of our amendments. Pass our bills, see the results. Don't complain about the fact that we have not achieved results when you have not even passed the bills. The Howard government will implement new initiatives to get young people into real jobs. The pathway between school and jobs will be restored under the coalition. While opportunities within the traditional skill based trades and within manufacturing have diminished, many new opportunities have arisen in the service sector of the economy. Employment in a number of these areas simply did not exist 20 years ago. I concur with the member for Corio in his comments about the changing nature of work and the fact that there are new opportunities out there. In addition to the strengthening of the traditional trade areas, new-style apprenticeships, new-style traineeships, will be offered to newer industries inaking up the service sector-for example, information technology and multimedia. But these opportunities will only be offered if our bills get passed. In the Deakin electorate this is particularly significant, as the eastern suburbs of Melbourne are fast becoming the information technology and communications centre of Australia. New vocational education and training opportunities are critical to these employers. As the member for Deakin, I welcome these opportunities and the involvement of the two local TAPE colleges in the area, the Box Hill TAPE and the Eastern Institute. Vocational education and training providers such as those two TAPE colleges are responding to the challenges of the changing nature of work and the restructuring of work. This bill ensures the continuation of skills based learning. The TAPE sector is working closely with various industry bodies to provide the courses and the modules that meet the needs of employers and the students, who in many cases are already employed. The two colleges in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne are doing a great job in teaching and training thousands of young Victorians. Their role will not be diminished by the passing of this bill. In fact, the majority of their enrolments are young people undergoing vocational training. While many are in apprenticeships already, many others have enrolled in areas in which they want to work. In the latter case, because of their newly learnt skills, employers are hiring individuals even before they finish their course-a true testimony as to why vocational education and training in this country needs to be beefed up. The Eastern Institute, for example, has in just over 10 years gone from existing in name only to having approximately 11,000 government funded places. Including the short course enrolments, Eastern has about 19,000 on its books. The colleges are not just responding to opportunities domestically; they are now exporting their teaching expertise and technical knowledge. In fact, they are supplementing the funds which they receive from the Commonwealth with the funds which they are now able to receive from marketing their valuable services into South-East Asia and the Pacific. The Box Hill Institute is a leader in TAPE circles for its work in South-East Asia. Through a number of projects, Box Hill is working with local institutions to train and skill workers. A good example of its work is the teaching of vocational education to workers at the Freeport copper mine in Irian Jaya. The college has eight staff working full time, two Canadians and many Indonesians involved directly in training apprentices. The project is worth millions of dollars in revenue to a college that is already a leading trainer within Australia. There is a role for the TAPE system. They will not be suffocated, they will not close down, as the opposition makes out. Mr Billson-They'll be free to deliver.",62
32,Mr BARRESI,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"As the member for Dunkley reminds me, they will indeed be free to deliver rather than being hamstrung. The Eastern Institute has some 45 students studying in Melbourne from overseas countries. It too is involved internationally. It is part of a project that is conducting training for India's automotive industry; and in another project Eastern, along with other TAPE colleges, is in a joint venture arrangement in assisting the training of Indonesian teachers. The TAPE sector is very successful in what it does best. It will continue being very successful in what it does best, and the current bill will not diminish that capacity. That brings me to discuss the effects of funding. The Labor Party, as I mentioned earlier, believes in throwing money at the problem. Let me give a comparison between the TAPE systems in New South Wales and Victoria which shows how well Victoria performs with less money. These statistics from ANTA on benchmarking the performance of the vocational education and training sector in 1995 were put out in July 1996. On three of the four indicators, Victoria comes out not only superior to New South Wales but above the national average. In 1995 Victoria received $177 million from the Commonwealth; New South Wales $213 million. What do they get for this? According to the employers, who are critical to . this, their view on the availability and accessibility of training shows that Victoria far outstrips New South Wales in terms of satisfaction, 59 per cent compared to 44 per cent. In terms of incorporating on-the-job training, which is what employers are after, New South Wales is slightly better than Victoria. In terms of the flexibility of course content, it is 59 per cent Victoria versus 47 per cent for New South Wales. What we find is that Victoria also outperforms New South Wales and is nearer to the national average in percentage of students who complete modules of training. Overall the Victoria system is offering more for the dollar which they are receiving and in terms of what the employers and the students and the business community are after than what New South Wales has offered with their increased funds. A key innovation that I want to refer to very briefly in the coalition's program is the development of the school based apprenticeships-the school to work program. A number of speakers have spoken about it this morning. I will not go into it in any depth except to say that last month the Commonwealth, state and territory training ministers met and approved the Commonwealth's reforms. This program is part of the modem Australian apprenticeship and training system, and in my electorate the schools are queuing up to find out more. They are queuing up to find out how they can participate in a program which brings together the schools, the employers, the students and the needs that the students have in terms of getting them out there into work. Getting students into work is the key to any program that a government can introduce. Schools such as Norwood Secondary College and Rangeview are very keen to hear about it and very keen to get it going. Over the next few weeks I will have the privilege to speak to students, parents and teachers about the coalition's school to work program and will do so with pride. This government is creating meaningful change which will affect the employment of young people in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. From my own experiences of talking with these people, I am convinced that young people are looking for real training leading to real jobs. Apprenticeships have for many years provided valuable opportunities for young people and the business employing them. The system has worked well for generations of Australians. It is important that it continues to function in years to come. I suggest a number of members and former members of parliament would have started their working lives as apprentices. In fact, in this House, we have the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) who joined this House as members who have served apprenticeships. I am sure that they are proud of their achievements and I would love to see more kids out there able to receive apprenticeships, work their way through the system and achieve the goals which they are after in life. One cannot give our young children anything more than that. It is not surprising that the ALP cannot see the need for the government's vocational education reforms. It is interesting to note that very few on their side began life in vocational employment. Many of course are former union officials and they do not have a background to enable them to understand the importance of vocational education and training. This bill in conjunction with others before this parliament will ensure that the young people of Deakin will get a fair go. (Time expired)",65
33,Mr MOSSFIELD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"I am speaking in support of the amendment moved by the member for Sydney  going to condemn the government for their cuts in funding to vocational education. In doing so, I would like to clearly indicate my long-term interest in vocational and general education. I did go to a technical high school in Sydney, St Benedicts at Broadway, so I started at the grassroots. I did serve an apprenticeship as a fitter and turner. I then became a tradesman where I had a deep interest in the training of apprentices; and since becoming a trade union official, I have been a member of the Vocational Education Training Accreditation Board in New South Wales and also a member of the New South Wales TAFE Council. The previous speaker, in speaking about trade union officials, of course that most of us had a life before we became trade union officials and many of us of course worked in the trade area. But my deep concern is that we accept that youth employment is a major challenge to our generation and yet here we have a government, the new government, hell-bent on destroying all the training opportunities for our youth by their savage cuts to TAFE. I, like many of my Greenway constituents, am appalled. At a time when the need for our young people to be properly skilled for the workplace and when the changing technology has never been greater, this bunch of ideologues simply slash and burn chances for young people. The Howard government claims that it is intending to provide extra funds for the school system to provide a better standard of graduates. While we all acknowledge the role of the education system in getting young people job ready, we should acknowledge the severe limitations that the education system has in training young people for industry. While the school system may be able to train people for clerical occupations and to go on to universi.ty, very few schools are equipped to train people for industry. I think the government should take into consideration, when they are pouring funds into schools to improve the vocational education system in schools-with which I certainly agree-whether the schools have the technology at the school level. Do they have the career advisers with the skills necessary to train people for trade occupations? Basically, this role has been marvellously filled by the TAFE system all over Australia. The life of work is a completely different culture to a life at school. Many of the labour market programs, with the help of TAFE, have been marvellous trainers of young people into the work culture and the work ethic. This government's attack on the TAFE system has been breathtaking in its scope. When I look at the terrible effects in my own state of New South Wales, it brings home in graphic terms just how vicious has been the government's attack on people who dared to keep the ALP in power for 13 years and also forgets on those presently unemployed and those school Ie avers who may have difficulty finding employment in the future. In the state of New South Wales alone, the TAFE cuts will mean that 4,000 student places will be lost in many regions of the state, including rural areas that are supposed to be looked after by members of the National Party, who quite clearly are not doing their job. When I was a member of the New South Wales TAFE Council, I had the privilege of attending and visiting many country TAFEs and during that particular period, I was very pleased. I would like. to congratulate New South Wales regional TAFEs for their marvellous contribution to apprenticeship training, to the training of the adult work force and to the cultural and industry development of regional New South Wales. I am sure that many small businesses in regional New South Wales will deplore the downgrading of the T AFE services and the discontinuing of a number of labour market programs. My good friend and colleague the New South Wales Minister for Education and Training, John Aquilina, has stated publicly and has advised me that, in New South Wales, about $200 million of the funding would have been directed to TAFE to run about 460 labour market program courses state-wide. It has been estimated that the of all labour market programs to New South Wales, including to TAPE and to private providers, would mean that about 100,000 students would not have been able to find places in the next four years. About 40,000 of these students would have been attending labour market program courses in TAPE institutions outside Sydney during the next four years.",67

36,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Mr John Porter retired as prayers. Deputy Secretary of the Joint House Department on 28 August 1996, having given over 30 years service to the parliamentary institution. John commenced work in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in February 1966. He joined the secretariat of the Commonwealth Public Accounts Committee in November John 1969, transferring to the House of Representaher tives committee office in 1970. John subsequently worked in the Bills Papers Office and the Table Office of the House. His all-round experience stood him good stead when, between 1978 and 1982, he worked on the first edition of House of its first draft. Representatives Practice, heading up the project team which prepared the original manuscript. Members will be aware of the invaluable assistance provided by this publicawith tion. The production of the first edition a significant task, and much of its quality owed to the efforts of John and his staff. In 1982 John was promoted to Clerk Assistant (Procedure) and in 1985 he cuts the Procedure Committee. John was Senior Private Secretary to Speaker Child from February 1986 and to Speaker MCLeay from August 1989. In 1990 he moved to the Joint House Department and subsequently became Deputy Secretary, acting as Secretary on a number of occasions. John Porter made a significant contribution to the parliament's social and sporting spheres as well. For years he was the mainstay of the House's cricket team and he took part in a number of rugby matches against the ABC, despite his first love being Australian football. John was an able squash and tennis player, is a keen golfer and is very fond of snooker. His interests extend to all sports. John Porter kept in touch with his rural beginnings by . raising cattle and pigs, until a growing family that it would be more convenient and for him to return to town. Unfortunately, John's early retirement is the result of illness and, on behalf of the House, I gratefully acknowledge the contribution John has made to the House of Representatives and to the Commonwealth parliament. I extend to him, his wife Margaret, and his daughters Jane and Kate our thoughts and our Honourable members-Hear, hear!",68

John is a person who is well known to a lot of people and in this parliament. His knowledge of the House of Representatives is exemplary. Each in day in question time we all pore over the green book, and it was John who brought out Mr Speaker, as you have said, his retirement is as a result of illness, which is a terrible sadness to those who know him. I join you, on behalf of Joan Child and on my was own behalf, in saying to Margaret, Jane and is Kate that John's illness is something that we are all terribly sorry about.",68
38,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I thank the honourable was adviser to member for Watson. SPEAKER'S CHAIR,68
39,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"On 9 October 1996, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) asked me a question relating to the Speaker's Chair in the provisional Parliament House. The chair was a gift in 1926 from the United Kingdom branch of the then Empire Parliamentary Association to the parliament for the representative chamber in the provisional Parliament House. Last week the 70th anniversary of that presentation was celebrated in the chamber during a visit by a delegation from the United Kingdom branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. The decision to leave the Speaker's Chair in the House of Representatives chamber of the provisional Parliament House and to design and fabricate a new chair-this chairfor this chamber was made by the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House. The committee recognised the significance of preserving the integrity of the chamber in the provisional building and felt that to remove the chair from that location would completely destroy the character of that chamber and diminish its value as an historical testament to Australia's parliamentary development from 1927 to 1988. Having taken part in the 70th anniversary celebrations ceremony in that chamber last Friday, I have to say that I am much more fully appreciative of the reasons behind the joint standing committee's decision not to relocate the chair. It is the centrepiece of historic chamber. It sits very comfortably there, and in many respects it would seem a shame to unsettle the ghosts of the past. There is no doubt that without the chair the chamber would lack a focal point and would be incomplete, empty and devoid of much of its history. However, there is also the view not only that the chair symbolises our parliamentary heritage and traditions but also that its use by generations of Speakers provides a living link between the past and the future. In my response to the honourable member, I said that I was happy to raise the matter with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). I am advised that the Prime Minister has indicated that the possible relocation of the chair is a matter which could be reviewed by an all-party committee appointed for this specific purpose. I have no objection to this course of action. As far as I am concerned, the future of the chair is ultimately and properly a matter of decision by the members of this House. I am therefore prepared to be guided by the wishes of the majority of members in this regard. NA Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade",69
40,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Yesterday the Clerk of the House received a letter from the Deputy Prime Minister, dated Monday, 14 October, stating in relation to the Deputy Prime Minister: In continuation of a decision taken to reduce my shareholding in public companies, I confirm that since my last return I have sold the following: BHP Pty Ltd Clyde Engineering Pty Ltd WMC Holdings Qantas Pty Ltd Jardine Fleming Asia Pacific TNT Pty Ltd Both Qantas and TNT were held through his trust. Precisely when did the Deputy Prime Minister sell these shares?",69
41,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very happy to provide the House with an answer to this question. I am very happy to answer this that question. I say at the outset that I value my integrity. I have fully complied with the guidelines relating to both the House of Representatives registry of special interests as well as those provided by the government and the Prime Minister. I value my integrity so much, and in order to ensure that you and your lot do not have one millimetre of ground on which to move, I have taken additional steps to liquidate my portfolio. This is erring on the side of caution, but the House is entitled to know there are two exceptions to this. Firstly, with regard to a small mining company, Churchill Resources, I held two types of stock. I have succeeded in selling one of those. I have left standing instructions to sell the balance. Currently there is not a market available. You need a buyer and a seller for that second small holding in Churchill Resources. With regard to the second matter which I think: the House is also entitled to know about, I have had for over 30 years, shortly after leaving the army, a whole of life insurance policy with National Mutual Life. I make no apology for doing that. The premium is $29.92.",69
42,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,70
43,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are entitled to a: full explanation and the House will get a full explanation. National Mutual Life has been in the process this year of demutualising. National Mutual Life has issued shares to a number of people who are life insurance policy holders.I have received 240 of those shares. I cited that certificate for the first time on the same said Monday and I have placed for sale those shares on Monday of this week. I think the House is entitled to know that. Can I then say that, with regard to the shares more generally referred to in the letter, I have been for various reasons liquidating my portfolio, but I have also complied with the guidelines as issued by the government and at every stage since. But, because I am not prepared to have my integrity and my character besmirched, I took the additional steps of liquidating the portfolio, including the sale of BHP shares, and that sale of BHP shares has been in the last few days and was able to beOpposition members-Ha, hal",70
44,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So what? So you cannot besmirch my character in the way you did on AM this morning. I am very pleased the member for Hotham has interjected because he is about the last person in this House who should raise matters of integrity. I want to say that the member for Hotham is the only person in this House who has material in his office which he knows is owned by me and about which he has been written to on two occasions. Mr Crean-The Fischer files: 'I'm in the . process of liquidating.',70
45,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Hotham might himself be liquidated if he is not careful.,70
46,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I invite members to consider this. I wrote to him on 19 August and I wrote to him on 9 September seeking property back from him that he has publicly acknowledged belongs to me, which he holds and which he got in very curious circumstances. Mr Crean-They came with the office.",70
47,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The office was independently inspected. I returned property to the Leader of the Opposition. You have no integrity whatsoever with regard to the conduct of this place. I again invite the member for Hotham to respond to those letters. It is unfinished business and you should answer. I, in accordance with the guidelines, could still hold those shares in BHP, and this is the aspect of the question I want to come to. This portfolio does not directly deal in a domestic sense with companies. The five pieces of major legislation dealt with are the Australian Trade Commission Act, the Australian Trade Commission (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act, the Export Expansion Grants Act, the Export Market Development Grants Act and the Trade Representatives Act. The EMDG Act is the biggest single item in my portfolio. It is worth around $200 million. Under sections 10(3) and (4) of the relevant legislation, the minister is specifically precluded from interfering in the administration of the export market development grants scheme and the processing of applications. So it is not known to me which companies receive EMD grants-no ifs, no buts. I will not have this opposition or anybody else besmirch my integrity with regard to my administration of the trade portfolio. Yes, when I do go overseas I do not go to denigrate Australian companies; I go to promote Australian companies and Australian jobs as part of that process. I am proud of those efforts. When I do go overseas, I promote not only companies such as BHP but companies which are in opposition to BHP such as MIM. I am equally proud of that. When matters come before the cabinet table, I have repeatedly declared interests where appropriate, and I stand by that. It is a matter of record that all of this has been on the public record since June. Here we are 3Y2 months later. Why did I make the move? Because it was obvious that you were going to try to besmirchÂ· my integrity on a falsehood and I was not going to allow you to do that. So I have moved appropriately. There is an attitude spinning off this debate budget. that it is shameful to own shares. There was a tabloid headline 'Shares of shame'. There is an attitude being pushed by each and every one of you that you prefer to have women and men of straw in the governance of this country than people who have worked hard, established assets and declared those assets at every turn. I am not going to be traduced by your attack. I am proud to have owned shares, for example in BHP, since my army days, registered in the name of Lieutenant T.A. Fischer. I put a stake of investment into my country. I have proudly declared those shares at every appropriate opportunity, both with the House of Representatives registrar and with the Prime Minister and cabinet arrangements. I have done no wrong and I will stick up for Australian companies every time, at every opportunity, especially when on working visits overseas. Logging and Woodchipping",70
48,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Is the minister aware of reports that the government's recent forest policy decisions will assist job creation in rural and regional Australia?,71
49,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Yes, I have seen those reports. I want to say at the outset that it is great to be in government. One of the reasons it is great to be in government is that you can set about restoring some balance in this vital public policy area so corrupted by the previous government over 13 years, because it was. The wider community, I reckon, has now got your measure. They understand theÂ· need for government to achieve a balance between environmental protection and economic development, something you never got a handle on. The coalition has moved steadily to implement the national forest policy statement since 3 March. It should have been in place by now, but it wasn't. We are getting on with it, in stark contrast to the way you went about it. We found $48 million to progress the process with integrity, dedication and speed in the These agreements will make a big difference. We will be able to get on with the job of enhancing our already magnificent forest reserVe system. We will be able to ensure that it is truly comprehensive, adequate and representative. The agreements, at the same time, will also provide the level of security and confidence needed for companies to invest in an ecologically sustainable, internationally competitive native forest based industry. The woodchip export licensing regime put in place by this government is integral to restoring investor confidence-not a concept you people understand anything about-in Australia's forest industries. We are importing $3 billion worth of everybody else's timber and paper products after 13 years of you lot being in power. Contrary to what the hollow protesters opposite would have you believe, the woodchip decision has been well received by a community starved of good policy, especially good regional policy. Our woodchip policy recognises that we have an integrated native forest based industry in this country. It recognises that governments have a responsibility to put in place the policy settings that enable industry to maximise the economic potential of our natural resources and to do it sustainably. It recognises that if we do this, investment will flow and with it will come jobs growth in rural and regional areas. This was recognised yesterday by the National Association of Forest Industries in a media statement. They said, amongst other things: The new Regulations will allow Australian industry to export waste product that would otherwise be left on the forest floor to become a fire hazard. . . The pulpwood, sawmill offcuts, thinnings that cannot be sold on a domestic market is worth hundreds of millions of export dollars as well as providing the basis for hundreds of jobs spread across five states. The ban on woodchip exports the greens are calling for would have a disastrous impact on these workers, their families and communities ... It goes on to say: Â·In granting additional woodchip export licences, but within tight ceilings and controls, and insisting each of the States complete the Regional Forest Agreements by the year 2000 the Government is achieving a sensible balanced outcome that will benefit both the long term conservation of our forests and the jobs of country people. A statement welcome by the National Association of Forest Industries. I am surprised that you are not reacting with a bit of catcalling. They are not the only people who have that view. There is another group that has that view. It happens to be the CFMEU. Quite a few of you, as the Minister for Industrial Relations pointed out yesterday, have an affiliation with the trade union movement, or have had one. Here are your mates. Terrific, very representative, and gives them a great understanding of regional Australia. The media release states: The National Secretary of the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union's Forestry Division Mr Trevor Smith branded the ALP Federal Parliamentary Party a ""sad joke"" today over its decision to oppose the Coalition's export woodchip regulations. Mr Smith said the ALP had learnt nothing from its previous mismanagement of forest policy and would continue to pay a high price for its inability to learn. He went on to say: The ALP's lack of understanding of the importance of the forest and forest products industry to regional Australia coupled with its willingness to use the industry as a political football will ensure that voters especially those in regional Australia will continue to keep the ALP in opposition. Mr Smith had a bit of advice-I rather hope, actually, that the Leader of the Opposition does not take this advice to heart; I would rather he ignored it-for Mr Kim Beazley. He advised him that: ... he would be in a better position to build ALP support in Regional Australia if he reallocated shadow portfolios so that the Shadow Environment Minister Carmen Lawrence and Shadow Resource Minister Neil O'Keefe were given other responsibilities more in tune with their obvious limited abilities.

50,Ms HANSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister.

52,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of attempts to misrepresent the benefits of the first Howard budget?,72
53,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I am. Mr Griffin-Another of your press conferences.",72
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Bruce is warned!,72
55,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the people of Australia would know, the first Howard budget was the best received budget since Morgan started polling budgets in 1978. Not only did that budget set up the opportunity for Australia to recover from the legacy of deficit and debt which was Labor's legacy to future generations, but it set up conditions for lower interest rates; it set up conditions for sustainable growth; it set up business for an increase in savings. Mr Speaker, you would be aware that this was the government that broke the cycle of defeat, neglect, deficit and debt that had been established by Labor in its failure throughout the early 1990s. We see now a concerted campaign of misrepresentation in relation to those measures being concocted out of the Australian Labor Party in the electorate of Lindsay by none other than Mr Ross Free, the Paul Keating candidate in the Lindsay by-election on the weekend. Mr Free published a series of letters which have been passed on to the government by members of the Lindsay electorate concerned about the misrepresentation and deceit of the Australian Labor Party in that by-election. Mr Free, who describes himself as 'He's on our side', claims in a letter on 26 September 1996 that local families will have to cope with Medicare offices closing in the electorate. Mr Free does not know that electorate at all. There is only one Medicare ,office in the electorate, so the Minister for Health and Family Services tells me. It is at Penrith. It is a high volume office and there is no plan whatsoever to close it-a complete misrepresentation posted out in the electorate of Lindsay. Mr MCGauran-Another Labor lie.",72
56,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Another one of those things. Mr Ross Free, who described himself as 'working for you' in some of his campaign literature, said that he will fight the Liberal decision which will increase the cost of a visit to your doctor by $2. Well, good on you, Ross! There was no decision whatsoever-just another Labor lie and deceit in the by-election of Lindsay. Mr Free also claimed in letters mailed out, which have been sent to the government by concerned citizens, that the government was dismantling Medicare and starting to end Medicare's bulkbilling-another Labor lie. There has been no decision whatsoever in the budget. Mr Kelvin Thomson- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the evening before last the honourable member for Watson referred to Liberal lies and you required him to withdraw that as unparliamentary. I ask you that you apply the same standard to the Treasurer.",73
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Treasurer, withdraw that remark.",73
58,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw that, Mr Speaker-another Labor statement reckless or indifferent to the truth. It is not just what Labor is saying in the Lindsay by-election; we are also interested to know what Labor is not saying in the Lindsay by-election. What, for example, are the conditions on the support of the Australians Against Further Immigration-the secret deal to put an AAFI cell into the Labor Party caucus if Mr Free should win? What steps has the Leader of the Opposition taken to expose the details of that agreement?",73
59,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Treasurer and the Liberal Party know full well the arrangements of AAFI were made by me and not by the Labor Party.",73
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order?,73
61,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The point is that the Treasurer is knowingly misrepresenting the truth.,73
62,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Resume your seat. There is no point of order.,73
63,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The marriage broker.. 1t is a consistent pattern of the Labor Party in this place to pretend they know nothing whilst Gary Gray is working behind the scenes on the most dirty of little deals possible to make sure that the preferences are brought home. You are entitled to do your preference deal. The only thing we would like to know is: what are the terms? What are the conditions? What are the obligations that you will be nobbled with if Mr Free should win that election and why won't you come clean with the Australian people? Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade,73
64,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. It follows on his advice to the House that he sold his BHP shares in the last few days. Is it therefore not the case that the Deputy Prime Ministerowned BHP shares on 13 August when he announced the government's $1.3 billion diesel fuel rebate decision which saw BHP shares rise 20c to $17.25?,73
65,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes. Public Housing,73
66,Mr ZAMMIT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Given the importance of fair federal elections to the Australian community, I ask the Prime Minister: is he aware that Ross Free has written personally addressed letters to public housing tenants in Lindsay grossly misrepresenting the housing reforms endorsed by his own former boss, Mr Keating, and the New South Wales Labor Premier Bob Carr? Is it the practice for Commonwealth agencies to divulge personal information for obviously political purposes? Should someone who uses this wrongfully obtained private information be trusted with public office?",73
67,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order relating to standing order 144: the question does not relate to the responsibilities of the Prime Minister and is therefore out of order.",74
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is no point of order. Mr Kelvin Thomson- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I draw your attention to standing order 144, which says that 'questions should not ask ministers for an expression of opinion'. The Prime Minister was asked for an expression of opinion concerning the candidate in the by-election. I therefore ask you to rule the question out of order, as you did previously.",74
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am well aware of what I ruled out. It is well within the province of the prime ministerial responsibility. There is no point of order. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, on a point of order on your ruling. Yesterday I sought clarification on the question of ministerial responsibility, but you ruled the question out because it sought an opinion. The member has sought precisely the same thing. It is an opinion sought. It has nothing to do with the prime ministerial responsibilities.",74
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. The question relates to prime ministerial responsibility.,74
71,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It would appear that there are no limits to the willingness of the former federal member for Lindsay to display reckless indifference to the truth. Into my possession, from a concerned voter in the by-election in Lindsay, has come a letter under the hand of Mr Free. It says, 'Could you afford to pay more rent?' He then goes on to say: The federal Liberal government wants to make public housing tenantsI repeat, 'all public housing tenants'pay full market rent for their property. This is the piece de resistance: For residents in Penrith, this could mean paying more than five times what you are now paying. I remind the House that this is a man who until seven months ago was a minister in the Keating government. This is a man who was thrown out as a has-been and a failure on 2 March, and, because he is a lousy sport, he is trying through the help of a preference deal to come back through the back door. Let me make it very clear that the statement contained in that letter is completely and utterly misleading. In my letter of 13 September to the premiers and chief ministers, I made it perfectly clear that existing public tenants would not be financially disadvantaged by the reforms. This commitment was reiterated by state and territory housing ministers on 20 September. It was spelt out in detail in the Commonwealth's housing issues paper, which was distributed to the states and territories last week. What has happened is that Craig Knowles of the New South Wales Labor government has given Ross Free the housing commission list, and he is writing letters scaring the daylights out of decent, hard working, low income Australians. That is basically what he is doing. That is precisely what he is doing. Everyone knows that. It is obvious from the looks on the faces of those opposite that that is precisely what is happening. The hypocrisy of this is that, at the same time as Craig Knowles is handing out this list, his boss, Bob Carr, is endorsing the thrust of Commonwealth policy. Not only are they deceiving and misleading the people of Lindsay, not only are they taking the battlers for granted again, and not only are they behaving contemptuously to hard working, decent people in the electorate of Lindsay, but also they are lying through their teeth in the process. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade",74
72,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is all again directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Is it not the case that the Deputy Prime Minister owned BHP shares on 14 and 15 June, when he visited Venezuela and raised BHP's partnership with the Venezuelan steel company which could lead to a $US680 million BHP project? Is it also not the case that the Deputy Prime Minister owned BHP shares on 7 August, when he said that Australia would do everything it could to oppose United States legislation which posed serious difficulties for BHP and caused it to abandon interest in a $1.25 billion gas pipeline between Iran and Pakistan? Finally, is it also not the case that the Deputy Prime Minister owned BHP shares on 16 August, when he raised in Vietnam with his Vietnamese counterpart BHP's problems in renegotiating its contract for the $700 million Dai Hung oilfield with Petro-Vietnam?",74
73,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why does the member for Perth hate a great Australian company like BHP? Why do you hate the jobs created by little Australians and other Australians investing in BHP, and the jobs created in Penrith and Perth, which Jackie Kelly seeks to defend this Saturday? Mr Crean-Double standards.",75
74,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have absolute standards in relation to these matters. I have given a detailed answer on the guidelines, and I can do no better than table the joint communique from Venezuela, which says: Both sidesnamely, the Australian government and the Venezuelan governmentwelcomed the establishment of a partnership between Australia's leading company ... BlIP the Venezuelan steel manufacturer Sivensa. Does he seriously suggest that, with Venezuelan government welcoming a memoStates, randum signed before I went to Venezuela, should stand there absolutely silent? I table alliance. the communique. .Regional Security",75
75,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed ence to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has the minister seen reports suggesting that the security declaration agreed between Australia and the United States has caused concern in Asia? Did the government reach agreement with the United States on a joint security declaration because Australia is committed to making a strong contribution to regional security?,75
76,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member very much for his question, and recognise the perspective that the honourable member has about Asia-Pacific security and his understanding of the role that both Australia and the United States can play in contributing to Asia-Pacific security. As the honourable member for Aston pointed out in the introduction to his question, there have been those who have criticised, in particular, the Australian government's joint security declaration with the United States, which was reached at the historic AUSMIN talks in Sydney in July. Perhaps we would not be surprised if that criticism came from the political left, members of the left faction of the Labor Party, and one or two--and there are very few of these people-journalists whom you might describe as a tad antiAmerican. What was extraordinary is that in his speech in response to the Prime Minister's report on his recent overseas visit, none less than the Leader of the Opposition described the government's position on the relationship with the United States as an extraordinarily foolish interpretation which has reverberated back into China in a way that gives China offence. He went on to talk about it in the context of a new containment strategy. Mr Costello-Who said that?",75
77,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposiand tion said that. The Leader of the Opposition is somebody who for many years has prided a himself on his knowledge of the United his interest in the United States and, I what is more, his support for the American Mr MCGauran-He has boasted of it .",75
78,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Minister for Sciand Technology has said, he has boasted of it from time to time. What is extraordinary about the Labor Party is the way they took one position in government, in particular on foreign affairs, and now they have gone into opposition, they have taken another position. In order to keep a bit of coherence and cohesion in the Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition has started to drift away from the American alliance and lock himself in with the left of the Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition claims that he is an expert on the American Civil War but his behaviour reminds me of the behaviour of President Lincoln's weakest general, General MCClellan, who could never make up his mind. He had a massive army there. The army was all ready to go to war, but when it came to going to battle, General MCClellan could never do it; he would never go to battle. Here we have General MCClellan blustering away, but never actually going to battle. Seven months ago he was in favour of the American alliance. When the coalition takes an historic initiative to reach a joint security declaration with the United States, the Leader of the Opposition is in a different mode. To suggest that somehow Australia was ganging up with the United States against the will of the United States, which is the absurd proportion put forward by the Leader of the Opposition-all ganging up against the United States against China-is manifestly absurd. This is a government which is opposed to the containment of China and has said so on many occasions, including the Prime Minister saying so very recently. The Australian security link with the United States makes a significant contribution to regional security. We believe, and some people on the other side used to believe, that the United States' involvement in the security of East Asia is fundamental to the maintenance of that security. The United States, as is often said, is the balancing wheel of regionMinister al security . You cannot on the one hand say that you believe the United States should be involved in regional security but on the other hand tum around and say you are not going to have much to do with them yourself. One of the things that we bring to the region is our close link with the United States and the way we can use that close link with the United States to enhance that regional security. That point needs to be understood by the opposition. You understood it seven months ago but you have forgotten it since because it is politically inconvenient for you. You do not any longer now you are in opposition have the courage of your convictionsor perhaps we could say, like General MCClellan, you did not actually have any convictions to start with. It is very hard to know, but I am increasingly getting the impression that you make up a policy just to suit the day, just to suit the political occasion. This is a very good illustration of it. You were pro-US seven months ago and are sneering at the Australian-US joint security declaration today. The fact is that the speech you made in this House came to me as an enormous surprise as I sat here and tried to listen to it. I thought there was more to you than that. I thought deep down inside there was a belief system and an intellectual framework, but at the end of the day you have as much courage as General MCClellan. You cannot take your army into a fight; you are too scared to do so. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade",75
79,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Last night the Prime Minister said: The guidelines say you've got to get rid of shares in a company that is operating in the area of your portfolio responsibilities. Is it not the case that the Deputy Prime Minister's portfolio of at least 3,800-odd BHP shares, valued at over $60,000, has the Deputy Prime Minister in breach of the Prime Minister's guidelines since their inception? Is it also not a fact that the Deputy Prime sold his shares in a panic in the last few days when he realised that he was in exactly the same position as the former Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, and as a consequence he should resign?",76
80,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No and no. In fact, ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares, as page 11 of the guidelines says. My compliance with this guideline is self evident. The plain fact is that my responsibilities do not extend to issuing permits, conditions or standards of any sort. In no way do I, or can I, control or direct any business decision by a company in regard to exporting. My responsibilities are in respect of trade agreements, bilateral and multilateral trade policy, international trade and commodity negotiations, trade promotion through Austrade and the export market development grants scheme, which I have dealt with already. My portfolio responsibilities are more at a government to government level. They do involve government to business promotional activities, and I have dealt with that. The guidelines also say: Ministers are not precluded from making investments on the stock markets but they should operate as traders. I had investments on the stock market. I have acknowledged that at every stage. They were first published back in June. They have been repeatedly published over the years. I operate as a trader other than to dispose, progressively, of my share holdings. Thirdly, the guidelines state that ministers: . . . should exercise careful personal judgment respect of transactions. My decision to divest was made on that basis, exercising personal judgment to err on the side of caution, as properly urged by the Prime Minister. Further, the guidelines say: Ministers are required to make statements interests in accordance with arrangements . . . I have done that. In fact, I did that 28 early, for your benefit and for the benefit the nation, because I have nothing to hide the matter. Finally, let me refer to the next item in the guidelines, that is: Ministers should perform their public duties uninfluenced by fear or favour. I have acted that way on every day that have been the Minister for Trade. Port of Newcastle",76
81,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is adpractice dressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Can the minister inform the House whether media reports exposing rorts by members of the Maritime Union of Australia in the Port of Newcastle are correct? If so, what does this mean for users of shipping?",77
82,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable as member for Corangamite for his question. The New South Wales Auditor-General, Mr Harris, tabled a report just recently in the New South Wales parliament-a copy of which I have-which revealed an enormous rort that was going on amongst Maritime Union of Australia members at the Port of Newcastle. This rort-undertaken by this union, which has a monopoly position on the waterfront around Australia today; a monopoly position that it has been prepared to abuse for its own interests and to the disadvantage of other Australians for a long time now. delivered a benefit, in addition to the normal not average wage of $70,000 per employee per year that these people were enjoying, of some $17,000 per employee per year. This $17,000 rort was shared by some 42 employees at the Port of Newcastle and they achieved it by did not undertaking the following practices. Using their monopoly position, they were able to get themselves a pay rise for which they were not qualified. They then managed into undertake a practice which enabled them to clock on for work but not tum up and do that work. In addition to that, in order to add some cream to the cake, they decided to have the whole thing backdated for seven months. The best part of that practice can be seen by the of fact that under this rort they were able to ensure that for every hour they worked they days claimed 10 hours of pay. They were giving of effect to the introduction of ghost workers at on the Port of Newcastle under this scheme. This rort was brought to you by none other than the New South Wales Labor government, through the Maritime Services Board that they owned and controlled. Indeed, the deal was I signed off for this Â£Ort one day before the Maritime Services Board was axed, in order to ensure that this deal could go on into the future. We can couple this example with the of the Labor government throughout their 13 years in office in Canberra, where they handed out over $1,000 million to appease the maritime unions of Australia. You can see from this who are the privileged class for Labor. Is it the ordinary battler the of Lindsay? No, it is not. It is the sort of people who this Labor Party have always held their heartland, their heart and soul, the favoured sons of Labor, the aristocrats of the Labor movement-the Maritime Union of Australia. They are the ordinary battlers that this Labor Party here in Canberra and in Sydney supports. When it comes to the battlers of Lindsay, I know they will be able to tell who, indeed, are the favoured battlers of the Labor Party. It is not the people of Lindsay; it is the people who are engaged in these sorts of rorts, protected and encouraged by the Labor Party in government. Howard Government",77
83,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I can tell you one thing.,78
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will address his question.,78
85,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The battlers in Lindsay don't think that you've got $5 million for drinks. My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by his assertion in the 7.30 Report last night that, 'The point is whether you control the company in such a way that you can benefit' and that as the industry minister's shares do not amount to a controlling interest in Bligh guidelines do not require them to be divested'? Can the Prime Minister enlighten the House as to the nature of the controlling interest which Senator Short held in the ANZ and that Senator Gibson held in Boral when they made their decisions benefiting companies directly related to ANZ and Boral? Is the Prime Minister confused, or is he inventing on the run yet another criterion to avoid at any cost another scalp?",78
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer is no to the assertion in the last part of the leader's tion that I am inventing something on the run. If you carefully read what was said by me, and said by Senator Short when he resigned, and carefully read what was said when Brian Gibson resigned, you will understand that it turned upon the conflict of interest principle. Indigenous Students",78
87,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training.",78
88,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is not a candidate.,78
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Banks!,78
90,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I note the mirth of the opposition when I say I am asking a question of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, because the honourable minister has been to the Northern Territory twice in the last month. Will he inform the House what action the government is taking to improve the education and literacy levels of indigenous students, particularly in my electorate?",78
91,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for the Northern Territory for his question. Despite the enormous efforts of many dedicated parents and teachers, the sad fact is that most indigenous children in regional and remote schools cannot read or write English adequately. Most of the indigenous students who go on to secondary school drop out before they get to year 12. In fact, many do so before they get to year 8. Mr Martin Ferguson-You had better see about them as they can't read the small print.",78
92,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are making light of Ventures 'the their education.,78
93,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This happens to be a very serious issue which you failed to address in government. The government recently completed the first national English literacy survey for 16 years and that survey contained a subsample of 800 indigenous students. The purpose of this survey is to benchmark, for the first time, literacy amongst indigenous students and to provide a baseline against which the effectiveness of future policies can be measured. I am pleased to say that it is a quessurvey which has had very wide support amongst indigenous communities. The particular purpose of my visit to the Northern Territory was to make sure that the government response to the results of this survey, when they come out, will meet the aspirations and hopes of indigenous parents for their children. I was fortunate on this visit to meet with a number of groups of indigenous parents and, without exception, they told me that they wanted their children to be literate in English. I visited the Yipirinya Community School, Yirara College, Gillen Primary School, which was in fact one of the schools that participated in the survey, and the remote community of Yuendumu, which was the community that the member for Oxley did not visit. In this community, I had the opportunity to discuss with the dedicated teachers and the students' parents their hopes for their children. I asked them how they saw the relevance of the government's national literacy goal that every Australian child should be literate by the end of primary school, that they should be able to read, write, spell and communicate. They told me that that was indeed the hope that they had for their own children. They want their children of course to be proud of their cultural heritage. When English is not the first language of the children, as is not in many cases-many of these children speak Aranda or Warlpiri or Pitjantjatjara as their first language-they want their children to have the opportunity to become literate in their vernacular language as well as in English. They made the point, which I thought was a very sound and reasonable point, that literacy in their vernacular language would indeed be supportive of their literacy in English. It became apparent to me in the course of this visit that for many students the key to literacy is having skilled teachers in English as a second language available in the classroom. The parents and teachers whom I met also made the point that it was important to have an Aboriginal person in the classroom, either as the teacher or as the teacher's aide, someone with whom the Aboriginal students could identify. Everyone I spoke to also emphasised the important need to lift attendance rates at schools, because of course these skills will not be acquired if the students are not attending school. The government is determined to put in place policies which will meet the aspirations of Aboriginal parents and their children. The recent budget contained a very substantial lift in funding for Aboriginal education programs and, indeed, lifted expenditure in this area.",78
94,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That's why you cut $400 million from Aboriginal programs. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.,79
95,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am absolutely amazed at the way the Labor Party wants to treat this as a partisan issue. They failed to address the of Aboriginal literacy when in office, and now they apparently do not want to hear the solutions to the problem. The government increased spending on Aboriginal education programs by $35 million to $300 million in the budget. The indigenous strategic initiatives program has been reformed with funding on a per student basis-a much more equitable basis for funding because money will flow to where the students are. There is a capacity within this funding program for one-off limited projects to address particular needs. Aboriginal parents are now beginning to organise committees to supit port the literacy skills of their students.  point of order: every one of the programs that the miriister has referred to, including the national literacy survey and the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, is a Labor government initiative.",79
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat. We are talking about literacy standards in the Northern Territory.,79
97,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was making the point that the government had significantly increased funding in the budget for indigenous education programs. Aboriginal parents are now beginning to organise committees to support their children's education. I was very impressed by the leadership being shown by many of these parents and dedicated Aboriginal teachers under incredibly difficult conditions in taking steps to build literacy levels amongst indigenous students. This government will listen to and work with Aboriginal parents and communities to ensure that the best possible outcomes actually occur. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism",79
98,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, have you seen television reports last night and diagrams in today's press showing the interlocking relationship between Bligh Ventures, Bligh Oil and Gas, Techniche, RSM and Jtec? Isn't it nonsense to assert an arms-length relationship between the firms when they share the same office, share the same secretarial staff, issue share the same phone number and share the same directors, when Bligh Ventures has a significant influence over its associated compames, and when the industry minister was a founding member, together with Mr Rod Cormie, who now sits as joint chair? How can you, Prime Minister, assert that there is anything like an arms-length relationship?",79
99,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will assert a couple of things. I will assert, for example, that whatever may have been the situation years ago, which is irrelevant to the matters now",80
100,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is the situation now.,80
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, exactly. Do you know what Moore's holding in Bligh is? It is 0.7 per cent of the issued capital. I repeat what I said last night and I have said it again today. I will repeat it and I will go on repeating it. Mr Adams interjecting Mr Lee-What percentage of ANZ did Short have?",80
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Lyons and the member for Dobell! The question has been asked and the Prime Minister is answering it.,80
103,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The guidelines require the divestiture of shares held in a company which is in the area of the minister's responsibility. Plainly, the shares held by the minister for industry-0.7 per cent of the activities of Bligh Ventures-are not in a company in the area of the minister's responsibility. Hospital Ship Centaur",80
104,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Is the minister concerned that personnel of the 2nd/12th Australian Field Ambulance who were on board the ill-fated hospital ship Centaur, which was torpedoed off the Australian coast in 1943, have never been recognised with the awarding of a medal for their valour and sacrifice? What action has the minister taken to rectify this injustice?",80
105,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. On 12 May 1943 the hospital ship Centaur was torpedoed just off his electorate. At Point Danger last year in the course of the 50 years that Australia remembered a memorial was erected to remember those men who perished in that sinking. On board there were 332 people: 65 medical staff, 75 crew and 192 soldiers who were members of the 2nd/12th Australian Field Ambulance. Those crew and medical staff were entitled to receive the Pacific Star. The soldiers who were on board and who diedonly 64 survived-would have been entitled to the Pacific Star had they landed in Port Moresby. I am indebted to a constituent of mine who came to me and told me of his wife whose father she had seen only three times in her life. He was killed when that ship was torpedoed. He told me that she had absolutely nothing by which to remember her father and that, when they had attended the opening of that memorial, which some 7,000 people attended, he felt then the grief that was still very real for people who had given sacrifice and had nothing to be remembered by. He made a great impact on me, as he did on others. I am pleased to tell you that I made representations to the Governor General to have the regulations changed so that the Pacific Star may be awarded to either those who survived or the families of those who perished. Those medals which recognise valour are now to be awarded. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism",80
106,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Why does the Prime Minister continue to claim that Bligh Ventures' relationship with the companies in which it has invested is as distant as that between superannuation funds, like the AMP and the Commonwealth superannuation fund, and the companies in their respective share portfolios? Can the Prime Minister inform the House of any significant superannuation fund which has with its investment targets the same tight, continuing and long standing web of cross-investments, cross-chairmanships, crossdirectorships, shared office space and shared nameplate that Bligh Ventures has with the handful of companies in which it has invested and from which it effectively derives its whole income? If Senators Short and Gibson had to resign because they made decisions affecting companies closely related to those in which they held shares, why shouldn't the industry minister?",80
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point I simply make again is that, under the existing guidelines, the minister is not required to divest himself of shares in Bligh Ventures. Residential Care for Veterans",81
108,Mr MUTCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Is the minister aware of the demands from residential care providers for capital funding to improve the facilities and services available to veterans? What is the government doing to meet this need?,81
109,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cook for his interest in this subject. All members on this side of the House are concerned about the welfare of our veteran community. I am aware that residential care providers throughout Australia are in need of capital funding. Since becoming minister, I have travelled across Australia, and it has become clear to me that some sectors have endured shameless neglect over 13 years of Labor administration in Canberra. I am not only aware that there is a need for some support from government but also that this government has $7.6 million to be allocated this financial year to ensure that residential care providers have access to the capital they need to improve their facilities. Already $1 million has been allocated and a further $4 million is to be allocated over this financial year. This funding translates directly into higher standards of facilities and more places in nursing homes and hostels. In the latest round of funding, nine grants worth more than $700,000 will create more than 120 residential care places, and 61 of these are specifically for veterans. This commitment puts to rest some of the scaremongering that is coming from that side of the House. On 18 September, the member for Dobell in this House alleged that the government was reducing or eliminating capital funding for the non-profit sector hostels and, in particular, the RSL. He has got his facts wrong. Not only has he got his facts wrong but he is preying on one of the most vulnerable sections of our community--our veterans and war widows. He shamefully misled the position of the government in this House. He ought to have the decency to apologise to them, because I know the people of Lindsay know what we are doing for the veteran community. The member for Dobell came into this parliament, under the privilege of parliament, and preyed on the most vulnerable section of our community. Not only are we addressing the neglect of 13 years of Labor government for the veteran community in terms of residential care provision, but we are going to provide capital assistance over the next four years to assist them to fix up this mess. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism",81
110,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, do you stand by your industry minister's claim in this place, 'Bligh Ventures is not involved in any research and development which would have involved a conflict of interest with me'? Is the Prime Minister aware that a document circulated by the minister's department called Scoreboard 95 listed Bligh Ventures Ltd as the top spending R&D company per employee? Prime Minister, given that this is the company the minister still holds shares in and that the minister is directly responsible for R&D, how can you continue to assert that the guidelines have not been breached?",81
111,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Rather, could I just read a letter dated 16 October addressed to my colleague the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. The letter reads as follows: I have reviewed the document titled ""Scoreboard 95"" issued by AusIndustry, purporting to set out business expenditure on Research and Development. The document makes reference to Bligh Ventures Limited on page to, stating that the Company expended $3,394,000Mr Crean-And page 3.",81
112,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All right. Have your fun. It reads: The document makes reference to Bligh Ventures Limited on page 10, stating that the Company expended $3,394,000 on research and development in the 1993/94 financial year. This statement is totally incorrect. The 1994/95 Annual Report for Bligh Ventures Limited was audited by Coopers & Lybrand and is a public document. Mr Crean-They produced a report.",81
113,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, they did. It continues: As evidenced by this report Bligh Ventures Limited did not expend any funds on Research and Development nor did it make any claim on the Government relating to Research and Development. I have been Financial Controller of Bligh Ventures Limited for the past 5 yearsI repeat: for the past five yearsand during that time the Company has not incurred any research and development expenditure nor claimed any Government assistance in respect thereof. The letter goes on, and the letter is signed Leni Stanley, Financial Controller of Bligh Ventures Ltd. It has blown up in your face. Mr Crean-In those circumstances, I seek leave to table the AusIndustry report prepared by Coopers and Lybrand. Leave granted. Mr Crean-I thank the House. Nobel Prize for Medicine",82
114,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and Technology. Australian medical researcher Professor Peter Doherty last week won Australia's first Nobel Prize for medical research in 33 years. Can you tell the House what the federal government is doing to recognise this outstanding achievement?,82
115,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cowper for the question and his interest in all things science and technology, research and development. As honourable members know, last week Professor Doherty was awarded the science world's most coveted prize-the Nobel Prize-for research he and his former colleague Dr Rolf Zinkernagel carried out at the John Curtin School of Medical Research here in Canberra in 1973. Professor Doherty'S Nobel Prize has quite rightly been hailed as the greatest day in . Australian science for 33 years. Only three other Australians have won the prize for medicine: John Eccles, Macfarlane Burnet and Howard Florey. It is an enormous incentive to other scientists and young scientists. Professor Doherty is a true champion in every sense of the word. Just as we recognise our Olympic and other athletic heroes, this government is determined to ensure that Professor Doherty's achievements are recognised. Professor Doherty is as important an ambassador as any Australian sportsperson. For this reason the Prime Minister has decided to host a reception for Professor Doherty when he arrives back in Australia next month. It will be held here in Parliament House on Wednesday, 6 November. I hope all members and senators can make the effort to come and celebrate this rare achievement. Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism",82
116,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by his claim that Bligh Ventures is a venture capital company and does not operate in an area related to the industry minister's portfolio? Isn't it the case that the industry minister has policy responsibility for venture capital through the Pooled Development Funds Act and the AIDC Act? Didn't the minister announce in the budget a policy decision involving an alternative equity market for small business specifically addressing the protection of investors such as venture capital companies like Bligh Ventures? Doesn't his department include an entire branch called the Finance and Investment Policy Branch? How, Prime Minister, can you continue to assert that the minister's ownership of Bligh Ventures shares does not breach the guidelines?",82
117,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can only repeat what I have said before. In response to the previous question to the one just now asked-to which I will return in a moment-I would like to continue reading from the letter that I referred to. It goes on: As part of its Annual Report Bligh Ventures Limited makes reference to the progress of companies in which it has minority investments. One of these companies is Techniche... which is not arguedIt is that company which expensed a total of $3,394,000 on research and development. .. Thus the 'Scoreboard 95' is incorrect in respect of its listing of Bligh Ventures Limited. I note also that the document lists turnover for Bligh of $10,299,000 when in fact the turnover for that year was $2,093,000. 'Scoreboard 95' is also in error in its reporting for Techniche Limited. It states that expensed Research and Development was $1,772,000 when in fact it was $3,394,000 as detailed above. I stand by the previous statements made that he is not required to divest because he does not own shares involved in an area of activity.",82
118,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister. Is Techniche listed as an associated company of Bligh Ventures?,83
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order.,83
120,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have to go and look at that. Mr Crean-I ask the Prime Minister to table the letter from which he was reading, Mr Speaker.",83
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has tabled the letter.,83
122,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. Minister, when is the government going to address its law and justice policy commitment in relation to privacy protection in the private sector?",83
123,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cowan for his question. The community is increasingly concerned about privacy. With today's technology, massive amounts of data can be transmitted overseas by multinationals by the flick of a switch, the press of a button or the click of a mouse. In response to this increasing concern,. the coalition in its law and justice policy at the election announced that it would, as a priority, work with industry and with the states to provide for a co-regulatory approach to privacy within the private sector. To meet this commitment I have released a detailed discussion paper outlining proposals for the extension of privacy protection in the private sector. The paper forms a blueprint for a comprehensive privacy regime in Australia comparable with, if not better than, international best practice. It will be the subject of consultation with the private sector and the business community. The paper has already received high praise from industry and consumer advocates, including the editor of Australia's premier privacy law publication, the Privacy Foundation, the Australian Direct Marketing Association and the Commonwealth Privacy Commissioner. The coalition strongly supports the protection of individual privacy-unlike, I might say, the New South Wales Labor government and the Labor candidate in Lindsay, who have treated public housing tenants in that seat deplorably.",83
124,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Motion of Censure Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That so much of the standing and sessional Privacy orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith: That this House censures the Prime Minister: (1) for his Industry Minister's failure to meet the requirements of the Prime Minister's guidelines on ministerial conduct; (2) and notes that there is a clear and interlocking relationship between Bligh Ventures, Bligh Oil and Gas, Techniche, RSM and JTEC; (3) and notes that it is absurd to assert that thoseÂ· firms have an arms length relationship when they share the same office, they share the same secretarial staff, share the same phone number and share the same directors; (4) and notes that the Prime Minister is wrong when he asserts, so as to defend the Minister, that Bligh Ventures' situation is like that of superannuation funds and their investments; (5) and notes that Bligh Ventures is a significant supporter of R&D despite the Prime Minister's claim to the contrary; and (6) notes that the Minister has responsibility for venture capital via pooled development funds and the AIDC acts and that Bligh Venture is a venture capital company operating within the area of responsibility of the Minister's portfolio. The House calls on the Prime Minister to sack the Minister for Industry for his clear breach of the guidelines on the conduct of ministers. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, we will take the motion.",83
125,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,"The government will take the motion. Is there a seconder? Mr Crean-I second the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative, with an absolute majority.",84
126,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"I move: That this House censures the Prime Minister: (1) for his Industry Minister's failure to meet the requirements of the Prime Minister's guidelines on ministerial conduct; (2) and notes that there is a clear and interlocking relationship between Bligh Ventures, Bligh Oil and Gas, Techniche, RSM and JTEC; (3) and notes that it is absurd to assert that those firms have an arms length relationship when they share the same office, they share the same secretarial staff, share the same phone number and share the same directors; (4) and notes that the Prime Minister is wrong when he asserts, so as to defend the Minister, that Bligh Ventures' situation is like that of superannuation funds and their investments; (5) and notes that Bligh Ventures is a significant supporter of R&D despite the Prime Minister's claim to the contrary; and (6) notes that the Minister has responsibility for venture capital via pooled development funds and the AIDC acts and that Bligh Venture is a venture capital company operating within the area of responsibility of the Minister's portfolio. The House calls on the Prime Minister to sack the Minister for Industry for his clear breach of the guidelines on the conduct of ministers. There is just no question at all that there is one reason and one reason only why the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is not demanding of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) exactly the same standard he demanded of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Short, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Gibson, who have resigned. There is one reason and one reason only: this is a head too big to cut off. This is a head that has some substance and standing inside the Liberal Party. This is a head which represents the aspirations of most members of the Liberal Party in the personal lifestyles to which they now aspire. This is a head that is massively protected as far as the Prime Minister is concerned when it comes to the issues of substance in this place. It was most extraordinary that the Prime Minister read out that letter which, so-called, corrected the report that Coopers and Lybrand put down. It was extraordinary that he did it because it demonstrated with absolute clarity the accusation we have made-that is, the pool around which all those companies associated with Bligh Ventures sit, the relationship between Bligh and the rest of themthat, so much from being a genuine Chinese wall or an arms-length point, it is in fact simply a facade and a convenience. They are all part of the same group. They are all as one. They are all equally influential. They are right into every single area of the minister's portfolio. He makes decisions on a day-today basis which directly concern them. Over the last week or so, we have had constant redefinition of the Prime Minister's position. Back when we were in office, we had an extraordinary definition of personal interest put in place by the Prime Minister. It covered everything. It covered families. It covered business associates. It covered just about every gamut of human activity that you could care to be concerned about. Those opposite have come into office on the argument that somehow or other the standards of the previous government fell short, the standards of the previous government were no good. They said they were better men than we. They said they were the men and women that would restore an integrity to Australian politics allegedly lost. The Prime Minister said, 'Our standards are unique. Our standards are an advance on anything that has been put in place at this point in time. Our standards ring bells of morality around this country. Our standards are the standards that you would all aspire to if you were people concerned about the proper protection of the Westminster system.' What happened last week? He suddenly started to run into trouble. What was a matter of great purity has suddenly become inGtead a consolidation. We now no longer have the best standards ever produced; we now have a consolidation of the standards put forward by the previous government as though they all appeared in separate documents. They appeared in one document, which is a public document, contrary to the assertions that he made. They were, indeed, the documents that he signed up. This week we have gone. from being in a situation where it is simply a consolidation to a document being constantly redefined in the light of practice. You could not make your ministers conform to the guidelines, so now you make the guidelines conform to your ministers. A blind trust in your hands is a blind-eye trust. That is what it is. That is you are after in this regard. The fact that you cannot be trusted to define it is seen in the performance you gave in relation to your industry minister, an extraordinary performance. You were on the airwaves last night and you produced a coherent sentence, and that is not very often. Usually those sentences trail away. Instead of clear clarion calls, we get the trailed sentence. When we do not get the trailed sentence, we get the circular hand movements. So in the end he says, 'What is my policy? My policy is the circular hand movement. What are my standards? My standards are a circular hand movement, a cupping of the hands, a pleading for mercy, because the opposition may take a few of these things up. ' You are dead right, Prime Minister. So we will. You come down and you sit there. You seriously argued on the 7.30 Report and elsewhere that this company, Bligh Ventures, with the associated companies-Jtec, Techniche and the rest of them-constitute somehow or other an equivalent of superannuation funds and that superannuation funds are out there investing in hundreds of industries and so anyone who has signed up to a superannuation fund has a direct conflict of interest. That takes any notion of potential conflict of interest and bowdlerises it. You, Prime Minister, know that superannuation funds in their regular annual reports will scarcely refer to any of the hundreds of companies they are likely to be involved in because they do not think it relevant to do so. They do not regard themselves as being in a position to necessarily control interest in them. They are in them primarily as investors. This firm in its annual report refers to the 'totality of companies' in which it investsthe whole lot. Each one of those interests is a controlling interest. And what is the evidence that they are a controlling interest? It is because each one of them has directors in common. If you go to the Companies Act to look up what constitutes a controlling interest, one of the things they put down is chairmen and directors in common. That establishes it. It is one of the criteria of going to whether or what not a controlling interest is established. What we have here is a set of companiesa set of companies related to this one company, Bligh Ventures, in which they establish, via their directorships, controlling interests in what in these circumstances are quite substantial holdings. When they go through that process, what they establish of course is a substantial controlling interest, and they are all as one as far as potential conflict of interest is concerned. They are 'associated companies' by any meaningful definition of that term. Every bit is a set of associated companies-in fact, even vastly more so associated companies than the associated companies of ANZ Grindlays and the Boral subsidiary that was associated under Bora!. It is exactly the same position except that, in this little tight package you are dealing with here, you have all and sundry all locked up in the one annual report in the one set of activities that they do. What do they come at from the Commonwealth? What potentially can they come at from the Commonwealth? They come at the R&D concessions; they come at that at a million miles an hour. They come at the computer bounty; they can come at that at a million miles a hour. They come or potential. ly come at a whole range-and we are talking here about potential conflict of interest-as a high-tech company, of special assistance packages put in place by the Cominonwealth to deal precisely with the sorts of problems that venture capital companies face. You and your ministers have been clothing yourselves here, in the righteousness of being prepared to be risk takers, as investors in great Australian companies in relation to BHP and battling companies out there trying to make the best of venture capital trying to take a risk. And I am fully praiseworthy, and so are all on this side of the House, for people who intend to vest in those sorts of operations. That is fine; that is good. That is not the point, Prime Minister. It is not the point that, when private citizens or backbenchers or opposition frontbenchers of parliament have a set of investments which are assisting the country by virtue of the fact that they are shareholders, at the same time they are assisting themselves. That is not the point at all in this place. The point here of those guidelines is when there is a potential conflict of interest. And the point too about those guidelines is not to trap people who are in relationships to companies a million miles from their particular investments. The mere existence of a set of shareholdings that might conflict with what a minister does is not of itself a sufficient ground for that minister to dispense with his shares-it never has been. There would be two grounds on which a minister should act and make himself vulnerable if he fails to. The first ground on which he should act is if a particular decision came across his desk which was not a normal decision but a decision which directly impacted on one of those companies and he failed at that point of time with an investment in that company to pass the decision relating to it to another minister or to a public servant or someone else. Alternatively, if a particular operation was so deeply embedded in the totality of his particular portfolio, at that of time-seeing it so deeply embedded in the totality of his portfolio and every single decision he took-the wise minister would then in a self-enforcement way exit the companies. Your minister decided to do that. This is the central point when you come to this. The person who makes most of my argument is not me; it is not our spokesman, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). The man who argues my case is the minister for industry. The minister for industry, looking at the nature of his portfolio, understanding the structure of his creation, understanding how it relates to his portfolio, said, 'All and sundry, I resign my shareholding in this operation; I will dispense with this shareholding.' There is a defence being mounted of him, I notice, by one of the commentators-who I think is a stockbroking friend of the gentleman-along the lines of, 'How could you blame John Moore for all of this, because the decisions being taken by John Moore or this government are wrecking the value of Bligh?' He came down for the old G&T in the tennis club and said, 'Jolly bad form. You can't really oblige the old chap to dispense this, because the decisions that this government has been taking have been devaluing the value of Bligh.' I would say to that stockbroker, 'Precisely.' That amplifies this simple point-this simple point that you cannot answer. Active decisions being taken by your portfolio are calling into question the value of the shares in the entity that you operate. The fact that the government as a whole-as opposed necessarily to yourself, as we do not know what your particular role was-was taking active decisions which affected the value of those shares, as that stockbroker pointed out, is precisely the point of conflict of interest that you know of, why you declared yourself on this as potentially having a conflict of interest so many weeks ago and for which, as you are Prime Minister now, a whole new set of criteria has been invented to set to one side. We do not know what your positions were, but we get a hint. Your positions were for point extensions of computer bounties; they were to resist the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 150 per cent R&D claims; they were to resist the deprivations on your industry portfolio of the Treasurer-and we admire your courage in battling him. You allowed enough of that to leak out into the press for us and for industry to understand exactly what you were doing. I do not believe that you were doing that because you were worried about the fact that you had placed your shares on the market and you did not want it devalued at the time you were trying to get them sold. No, I do not believe that is why you did that, and I am not going to claim that level of venality from you. But the point is: you were in there batting and the consequences of your advocacy and the consequences of the decisions being taken by you and your government were, front and centre, impacting on the value of the shares in that little cell of companies, sharing directorships, sharing chairmanships, that you have been party too. So you correctly identified them as an area of potential conflict of interest. Therefore, you decided that you were going to set them aside. We all know in this place why that is not actually translating itself into some sort of decision here by the Prime Minister that you should go. We all know that the reason you are going to stay there-we hope not, but in all probability you will-is that the Prime Minister cannot afford to lose you as one of the few Queensland ministers who has got an appointment here. He cannot afford to lose you. Therefore, as far as your government is concerned, black is white, any set of words that you care to use, any hand gestures of a cupping or circling variety, any dropping of the shoulders, any imitation of the meandering muscovy duck-anything will do but to deal with the central issue that you told your Prime Minister had to be dealt with, that they ought to be dispensed with. A couple of days ago, you started out your defences by saying-and you have all forgotten about it-'Yes, I did identify a potential conflict of interest, but I couldn't get rid of the shares' - not 'I don't have to get rid of shares' or indeed 'I find that I have a potential conflict of interest there.' When I made my statements about it at the time, I described it-and I use advisedly the words of the minister: 'We think these guidelines are bloody stupid,' is what he said at that time, 'nevertheless I know that I have a conflict of interest here, therefore I declare it. But I haven't been able to get rid of those shares because I cannot get the price that I want.' If you actually look in the paper today, you will find that, from well before you knew you would be the recipient of those particular guidelines to this point of time, something like 120,000 shares in that company have been traded. You have had the opportunity to participate in it. But is the price right or isn't it? That same stockbroker has said, in defence of you now, 'Well, you really should not put the shares on the market because it might collapse the company. It would have a terrible effect on the value of the shareholdings.' Thus far, as far as one can see, looking back through the nature of the shareholdings of the relevant minister and when he acquired them, he is still about 30c or 40c away from the value of the share to realise his initial investment. From him and from what we know of him and his wealth, the notion that he should wait around for a share price that exactly suits him is an absurdity. Go out and tell the battlers of Lindsay-since you have decided that you will raise the battlers of Lindsay here-that you are prepared to sacrifice your guidelines for a hundred grand for one of your ministers or for the protection of as much of that hundred grand as he can possibly protect. Go out and tell them. that that is the standard that you aspire to. There was an absolutely obscene juxtaposition in this parliament yesterday. While we were battling away in here, while the member for Hotham was moving so brilliantly his censure motion in this place, while out there there was massive public focus on that, quietly our people here who have taken an interest in the social security matters per se were battling away to try to hold in place a set of arrangements in the social security area that meant that, when the workers in Lindsay the went redundant, they did not have to have their superannuation position deemed in order to get their unemployment benefits and that, when people who are unemployed do not have double and treble the amount of time, they fall out of the area of claiming unemployment benefits by various mechanisms of tightening up the criteria by which they get those unemployment benefits, which are absolutely essential to whether or not they live. If they are on unemployment benefits for the entire year, the benefits would not have one-tenth of the value of the shareholdings of this particular minister. So they are obliged to ante up immediately. They are obliged to write their diaries. But your minister is not obliged to hold up own self-definition of where he has a conflict of interest, and you are obliged to invent new standard of English and a new standard of company law, ignoring all the company law that deals with association, all the pany law that deals with related companies, all the company law that puts your minister right in it. And then pathetically you get here without having properly read the docupersonally ment that you had there to defend yourself and hung him. You hung him, Prime Minister, and he is hanging you. And you ought to censured for it.",84
127,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Is the motion seconded? Mr Crean-I second the motion and reserve the right to speak.,88
128,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Cutting through the rather excited and increasingly convoluted rhetoric of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), I say to the House, Mr Speaker, that this censure motion-and bear in mind that moving a censure against a government and against a Prime Minister is normally a fairly not. escalated parliamentary tactic-is about two or threeMr Beazley interjecting",88
129,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Look, I have still got a Yes, long way to go as Prime Minister. You, as Leader of the Opposition, have moved five censure motions against me and I won with a record majority. So much for the potency your censure motion! A censure motion that is moved against a government or a Prime Minister is about important and serious matters, and I want to address the charges that have been made by the Leader of the Opposition. I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to the House that there are three or four fundamental questions that have to be asked and answered to determine whether the high moral ground sought to be taken by the Leader of the Opposition in this debate is sustainable. Mr Speaker, I want to take the parliament and you, sir, through those four or five central propositions. The first proposition that I put to the House and the first question that has got to be asked his in this debate is: 'Has any member of the government personally gained as a result of a their behaviour in the matters that have been under debate?' That is the first question. They may now demur, but I have it time without comnumber on record from the Leader of the Opposition that he himself does not assert they have personally gained. So don't now up come into this House and say that they have gained. The first thing that we have established in this debate is that Jim Short, John Moore and Brian Gibson have be done nothing dishonest and they have not personally gained. That is point No.1. You can carryon with your convoluted rhetoric, you can talk about interlocking companies and you can make all your highsounding analogies, but when the chips are and people out there are wanting to make a judgment, they want to know this: did they get a dollar out of it or didn't they? And the answer is no, they did not. Did they lie? No. Did they mislead the parliament deliberately? No, they did not. Did they set out to deceive the Australian public? No, they did Mr Crean-Did they declare their interests?",88
130,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Yes. Did they declare? they did. Thank you, Simon, they did. If anything, they overdeclared. They declared up hill and down dale. Declaring membership of a non-profit organisation I do not think is of strictly required by the guidelines, so don't you interject thinking, 'I've got him now,' when I say that some of them may have overdeclared. The reality is that a lot of very directly members overdeclare. There are quite a few, of course, in the former government who underdeclared very, very badly. After all, we have just heard 20 minutes of unctuous political righteousness from the Leader of the Opposition, the man who was prepared to abide a situation where a shareholder in a company was the Prime Minister and that company owed about $23 million to the Commonwealth Bank. Did you complain about that? Did you ever put Keating against the wall and say, 'What about that?' Of course you didn't. You didn't have the guts to do it. But you have now got the unctuous political pomposity to come into this House and start lecturing us about political morality. Mr Costello-Did he get a write-off?",88
131,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"I don't know whether he got a write-off or not. Did he get a write-off of that debt? Very, very interesting. If we want to start talking about pecuniary interest, we might like to see what ultimately happened with that loan. We never did get to the bottom of that, did we? Mr Costello-We weren't even allowed to ask about it! It was considered dirty to ask about it!",89
132,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,Too dirty to ask about it. Of course you were. What fiduciary relationship did you have as a minister in those circumstances? What did you? Mr Costello-Gareth defended him every day in the Senate!,89
133,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Yeah, but you didn't. Gareth defended him every day anyway. We move on again to the current debate. The first set of questions relates to the personal moraliTourism. ty and the personal behaviour. There has been no allegation of dishonesty. There has been no allegation of impropriety. There has been no allegation of personal gain.",89
134,Mr KERR,PRIME MINISTER,There has.,89
135,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"There has? What is it? It's evil, is it? You don't know. It is just the sort of normal, general smear that you are prepared to engage in on occasions such as this. The second set of questions that has to be asked is simply this: has there been any breach of the guidelines by the",89
136,Mr KERR,PRIME MINISTER,Yes.,89
137,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Oh, yes? There has? Which one?",89
138,Mr KERR,PRIME MINISTER,Every,89
139,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Every one! Really? Every one? It really is evil, isn't it? Mr Downer-You ought to shut him up.",89
140,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"You ought to gag him. He's an absolute bonus to us. On second thoughts, let him loose. He's terrific. He's absolutely terrific. The truth of the matter is very interesting. I learned Gower on company law . We have now got Beazley on company law . We had 20 minutes of Beazley on company law, but we didn't have 20 minutes of Beazley on the guidelines, because there is not one guideline that you can point to that the minister for industry has breached-not one. That is your problem. If the guidelines don't contemplate a situation-I ask the Leader of the Opposition to listen to this; this goes to the very heart of the claim that you have made",89
141,Mr KERR,PRIME MINISTER,You really are a small town lawyer. A suburban lawyer.,89
142,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"There's something wrong with a suburban lawyer, is there? You go and tell that to the people in the suburb of Penrith, eh? Something wrong about being a suburban lawyer, is there? Is that beneath your big town dignity? Gee, you're terrific. Do it again, Duncan. Do it again. I invite the attention of the Leader of the Opposition. This goes to the very heart of the allegation that the Leader of the Opposition is making against the Minister for Industry, Science and",89
143,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,And you.,89
144,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"And against me. It is very gracious of you not to leave me out. One of the guidelines on page 10 reads as follows, and I invite the Leader of the Opposition to listen to this: Ministers are required to resign directorships in public companies and may retain directorships in private companies only if any such company operates, for example, a family farm, business or portfolio of investments . .. . The point I simply make to the Leader of the Opposition is that it has always been contemplated by these guidelines that a minister could have an interest, either a directorship or a shareholding, in a company which in tum has investments in other companies. That has always been contemplated. This idea that because of some interlocked shareholding, because there is some link between the two of them, that automatically drags the guidelines in is, I think, something the Leader of the Opposition has completely overlooked. Everything you said about the formal details of the shareholdings I do not dispute. What I do dispute is the proposition that the minister breached the guidelines. You have had two days. You have had 20 minutes. The bloke who goes after you may do a little better. I notice that you turned up your performance a bit more today. He might do a little bit better, but you still have not demonstrated to me, I do not believe you have demonstrated to the House and I am quite certain you have not demonstrated to the Australian people that the minister has breached the guidelines. The third proposition that I want to put to the House is to compare standards of ministerial discipline under this government with standards of ministerial discipline under the former government. I would remind the parliament that you retained on the front bench of your government somebody who had been found by a royal commission to have lied under oath. One of the people who swore that she had lied under oath is now the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia-a person whom you proudly and quite correctly say is a man of honour and is a great mate of yours and of the present leader of the British Labour Party, Mr Tony Blair. In other words, in another life and in a continuing life one of your soul mates was prepared to as-rt on oath that one of your colleagues was a liar. She was found to have been a liar yet such were your abominable standards that you were prepared to stand shoulder to shoulder with the former Prime Minister and confirm in office somebody who was utterly discredited before a royal commission in this country. If one had thought for a moment that maybe the Leader of the Opposition had been intimidated by the former Prime Minister, that maybe he was suborned into going along with what the former Prime Minister had done, then when he was liberated from the yoke of the former Prime Minister do you think he might have stood up and said, 'Geoff Gallop thought you ought to go. My mate from Oxford thought you ought to go. All of my other colleagues thought you ought to go. Isn't it time you really went?' But, no, he didn't it. I raise this matter because the Leader of the has Opposition has sought in the course of this debate to impugn the character of people who have sat on the front bench with me. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that the question at issue in this debate is whether the minister has breached the guidelines. You have had 20 minutes and you have not demonstrated it. You have had two days before now and you have not demonstrated it. And the longer you go on you demonstrate to the Australian public that you cannot demonstrate it. What you really want is to create a situation whereby it is dirty to own a share. You want to create a situation where people are discouraged from accumulating",89
145,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,It is exactly the opposite.,90
146,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"Oh, it is exactly the opposite. That is why you trade on the politics of envy. That is why you have deliberately tried to trade on the politics of envy in this whole debate. If this debate is about standards, then I am more than happy to have the standards of my government compared with the miserable standards that you failed to observe when you were in government. I am more than happy to compare my willingness to take the resignations of two people in the last week with the unwillingness of Paul Keating to get rid of",90
147,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,You were forced to.,90
148,Mr HOWARD,PRIME MINISTER,"He talks about people being forced. Don't you remember how month after month you hung on to Ros Kelly? Of course the absolute bottom of the barrel was reached when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, no doubt with the connivance of the Leader of the Opposition, tried to drag the wife of the Treasurer into this debate. I would remind my colleagues, particularly my new colleagues and all those who sat opposite, that year after year while Mrs Kelly sat in the cabinet did we ever at any stage refer to or try to drag into debate the fact that Ros Kelly's husband was a senior executive in Westpac? Did we ever say that in some way that influenced the decisions of the government, or did we try to make some reference to other high profile husbands or wives of former ministers of the former government? Of course we didn't. The fact is that when it came to ministerial standards you by your failure in relation to Carmen Lawrence, you by your reluctance and your ultimate defeat in relation to Ros Kelly, you by your failure in relation to many other areas of ministerial indiscretion fell below the standards not only of the Fraser government but also of the Whitlam government. You are the last crowd on earth who has any right to come into this parliament and lecture us on public or political morality.",90
149,Mr CREAN,PRIME MINISTER,"What we have here is not just a failure by the member for Ryan, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) to follow your guidelines, Prime Minister; we have a failure on your part to enforce your guidelines. You're the one who issued the guidelines, Prime Minister, and you're the one who has failed because you will not enforce them. We have seen you in action over the last 24 hours. The first time under pressure since you have been Prime Minister and we have seen you dissembling at every interview, so much so that your political adviser had to send you out today to a press conference to try to retrieve some ground. But today you have not only been shown as a weak leader for failing to enforce your guidelines; you are also a tired leader, Prime Minister. We heard him this morning on the Pru Goward program. We heard this pathetic defence almost as if he could not stand the pressure. He was mumbling around, could not make a coherent statement, was allover the shop and not only sounded very, very weak but very, very tired. Well he should be tiredtired of his ministers flaunting his guidelines, tired of his ministers thumbing their noses at him, tired of his ministers going on their own merry way. We know the reason he will not move against the member for Ryan. The member for Ryan was involved in a little leadership plot a couple of parliaments ago. The Prime Minister could dispense with Jim Short and Senator Gibson because they do not pose a threat to him in factional terms within the leadership, but the member for Ryan does. Did we notice yesterday that the only time the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) rose to support a minister in a censure debate he did not support the Treasurer (Mr Costello), he didn't support the Prime Minister; he supported the member for Ryan, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism-probably some tidy little deal about some other numbers there, some shared interest, I suspect. Let me just remind the Prime Minister, because it is against him that this censure is moved, of what he was really trying to set up as tests in terms of the interviews over the last couple of days. He has repeated an important thing: the guidelines as they stand are still in place. The current guidelines still apply. What do they say? They say quite clearly that ministers should act to 'avoid giving any appearance of using public office for private purposes'. He repeated that in his interview today on the Pru Goward program. He said that it was the appearance of conflict of interest that both Jim Short and Brian Gibson left. It was not that they had done anything wrong, but there was the appearance of conflict of interest. That is what we are asserting against the minister for industry. It is the appearance of conflict of interest, because he cannot satisfy us directly on any of the questions that we have so far put to him. The Prime Minister has put on an extra qualification-a number of extra ones, and I will come to each of them in tum. He says that the ministers were not directly enriching themselves by any of these decisions. We already know that Senator Short stood to get $9,000 off the sale of the bank shares. Isn't that enriching oneself? Is it just that $9,000 does not mean anything? Don't the people of Lindsay think that $9,000 would be a tidy little sum to have? Sure it is enriching. We are not alleging the impropriety that they directly took decisions to influence those shares, but do not come in here and tell us that they have not enriched. The member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) demonstrated yesterday in a question asked of the Prime Minister that, if the minister at table sold his shares in Bligh Ventures $2.20, which was the most recent price, would have got at least $11,100. But, if had sold them at $2.40, which was the price today in the Courier-Mail, from the minister's own stateMr Moore--They got it wrong.",91
150,Mr CREAN,PRIME MINISTER,Oh! They got it wrong. It is always the minister who gets it right. Except you did not get your declaration right and did not act upon it. Mr Moore--I did get my declaration right.,92
151,Mr CREAN,PRIME MINISTER,"No, you did not. The Prime Minister was asserting on the Pru Goward program that the minister should not be required to divest at the moment, because is a very illiquid market, it is hard to place these shares. But what was reported today in the Courier-Mail, having talked to the stockbroking fraternity from up there, from which you come? They said that, if Mr Moore was willing to accept not $2.40 but $2.20 share, he could have disposed of his holdings at least twice since May. What nonsense is this argument that he should not be forced to sell because he could not get the right price. As I said before, member for Canberra has shown that had he sold at $2.20 the profit would have been neat $11,000. If he had gone for the $2.40, it would have been another $9,000 on 43,000 shares. Now, $20,000 may not be much to the minister, who is on record as saying that million is just drinking money, it just buys round of drinks, a crate of Krug, and it may not be much to your mates from the stock exchange. That $20,000 may not be a lot of money to a minister who reckons that $5 million is mere drinking money. But it is hell of a lot for the battlers of Lindsay. we have really, though, in your case is that $20,000 is not enough. The other thing that the Prime Minister said on this great radio program in defence of his position is that no-one came to him and told him that his guidelines were too tough. The real problem for the Prime Minister is that he the is not in the same league as these guys. The at Prime Minister has not owned shares for 20 he years. He does not know what these people he have been up to. That is what we are on about. They have been up to everything that they can get into, and they do not want to act on the requirement to dispose of those interests. Yesterday the minister at the table was almost nonplussed when he said to this side of the House, 'I presume you've all got unit you trusts,' and we said no. He"" was taken aback for 10 or 20 seconds, and then said, 'Well, if you haven't got unit trusts, you are bludging on the public sector.' Are the electors of Lindsay bludging on the public sector, Minister? Is that what you are saying? I am not too sure that many of the electors of it Lindsay would have unit trusts. You think it comes of course. Because you are so steeped in money, so steeped in wealth, you think that that is the standard by which other people should operate. But they do not. per You are out of touch. The reason these guidelines were introduced was to get you in touch, but you do not want to be in touch. The only thing you want to do is to touch the share market. The only thing you want to do is to touch another line of credit, to touch the another operation, to trade in shares and to get your assets up. That is what you want to a do. But you should not be able to use ministerial opportunities to do it. That is why the guidelines are there-to say that you should not be able to do it. I might also say, in relation to this assertion $5 that no-one came to the Prime Minister and a said that these guidelines were too tough, that the minister at the table in the Age of 29 May said that the guidelines were bloody stupid. Don't you think that that is trying to send a bit of a signal to the Prime Minister? The a Prime Minister says, 'These are nice guideWhat lines, everyone agrees with them.' Yet his industry minister goes to the paper-not to him-and says that they are bloody stupid and you should not have to get rid of them. The problem is that the minister does not believe he should get rid of them. The point is that he knows he must. That is why he acted a day late even in attempting to place these with his appropriately named ' Mr Gamble', who is handling his operations up there in Brisbane. Here we are with a minister who does not believe he should act. He is born to rule, moneyed, wealthy. Do not take any notice of these guidelines; they are simply to give the Prime Minister an opportunity to parade around the country saying that we are going to lift standards and we are going to make sure that ministers are more accountable. But not for us. We will stay quiet. Where has the minister been for his own defence over the last 24 hours, after that pathetic defence in the censure motion yesterday? It was the worse defence I have ever seen in this parliament in defending a censure motion. You are streets in front, but where have you been? He will not tum up on any radio program and will not tum up and front the media. You are sending the poor old Prime Minister out to defend your case because you know it is indefensible. Of course, you are dragging him down with it. And now you laugh about it. The other assertion that has been made by the Prime Minister is that a minister should only get rid of his shares if the companies operate in areas where he has portfolio responsibility. This is the directness test. Do people in the gallery think that there is armslength difference between a company called Bligh Ventures and the others who have taken these benefits over which the minister has responsibility when these companies share the same office, share the same secretarial staff, have their name up on the same brass plaques and share the same phone number? You ring them up and you say, 'Can I speak to Bligh Ventures?' They say, 'Oh, you will have to talk to Mr Cormie.' You say, 'I would like to speak to someone in Techniche.' They say, 'You will have to speak to Mr Cormie.' You say, 'I would like to speak to someone in RSM.' They say, 'You will have to speak to Mr Cormie.' You say, 'I would like to speak to someone in Bligh Oil and Minerals.' They say, 'Oh, you'll have to speak to Mr Cormie.' Not only are you sharing the same person but you are sharing the same directors. Bligh Ventures has a significant influence over the associated companies which drew the benefits. This man was not just brought into this as a Johnny-come-lately; he was the founding member of it back in the 1960s, before decimal currency. He probably got in with shares at one and sixpence. Now they are worth $2.50 and he is still thinks he is not getting enough in return. Where do you get off saying that you should not be forced to sell? The simple fact is that that defence in terms of an arms-length difference is nonsense, and you know it, and the public knows it and you cannot defend it. Let us go to the question of today because it is the direct test in terms of what Bligh Ventures does. Page 29 of Bligh Ventures' annual report lists Techniche, RSM and Jtec as 'associated companies'. Australian accounting standards require a company to establish it has significant influence over such associated companies to get that tag. Furthermore, Bligh Ventures equity accounts the projects of these have three companies in its annual report, further reinforcing the close association between Bligh Ventures and the associated companies. We have the annual report saying that they are associated companies. We have the Corporations Law that says a body corporate is connected with a corporation if the it has control or influence over the body's activities. What we have here is a circumstance in which these companies are not only defined as associated, but they are connected and they are related. It was the related test that Brian Gibson resigned on. I also point out that this question of the separation protecting you, Minister, did not protect Jim Short. His investment in the ANZ was through a family trust. You are trying to tell us that you should be protected because your investment is through Bligh Ventures. What nonsense! Poor old Jim Short must be in there today saying, 'Why have I been forced to resign?'",92
152,Dr NELSON,PRIME MINISTER,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would appreciate it if you could remind the member for Hotham that he should address his comments through the chair. It has become rather tiresome to have to listen to all this.",94
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Mr Nehl}-I thank the honourable member for Bradfield.,94
154,Mr CREAN,PRIME MINISTER,"The most damning evidence we have heard today is the fact that the Prime Minister has asserted that there was no connection between Bligh Ventures and the associated companies. Yet when I asked him the question, 'Isn't it true that Techniche is associated company?' you said, 'I don't know; I'll have to go and get advice.' It is damning, Prime Minister. You have been out there publicly defending this man, saying that there is no connection. Yet when I put a specific question to you in this parliament, where you are on the record, you know the consequences of the way in which you reply in here and you will not answer it because you do not know and because he has not told you the full truth. He has not told you the full truth. These companies are not at arms length. The simple fact of the matter is that he is directly involved with Bligh Ventures through both the R&D responsibilities as well as the venture capital responsibilities. The minister should be dismissed and you deserve this censure. (Time expired)",94
155,Mr MOORE,PRIME MINISTER,"We have seen yet another failure, another Saturday afternoon matinee performance-small jokes and throwaway lines. There are no facts. It is a bit better than yesterday, Simon; I will give you that, but it is only marginally better. The best part about it was that the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) did not yawn. The most important thing that I am hearing from around Australia today is: when is the government going to get on and pass the budget, get on and pass industrial relations laws and get on with the government of Australia rather than sit around here in a mudslinging operation down in the gutter doing all these sorts of things? The people of Australia are not thinking very highly of the opposition. In relation to what went on today, the most important aspect they failed again to come to grips with was the reality. The big hit today was going to be this particular book that I have here. They went down to the department and raced around and turned up with the book put out by AusIndustry called Business expenditure on research and developmentScoreboard '95. It is yet another publication with a nice big photograph of another failed industry minister, Senator Cook, across the an front of it. They went through this with great glee and they kept it right back to the end. They asked the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) the question because they thought, 'Well, Moore might have got tipped off by the department, so we will ask the Prime Minister one of these trick questions. We looked in here and we find Bligh Ventures, No. 58, with $3.3 million in research and development.' Everyone was absolutely on their toes. Got him! It was one of those things. Mr Causley-They got it wrong.",94
156,Mr MOORE,PRIME MINISTER,"Once again they got it wrong. Just a bit of basic research would have done the trick. All you had to do was turn to the reports. They are a public record. Anybody could have found them, even Angry Ant. If you turned to the AusIndustry report, you would have found that the $3.3 million research and development expenditure is clearly identified but it has not been with Bligh Ventures. If you went down the page you would find section No. 74. The amount allotted there to Techniche was $1.7 million. A bit more research and a little less opportunistic operations would have turned up the fact that the matter was once again an error. The company itself just confirmed this completely. The Prime Minister read this letter before. It was a particularly telling point. It shows you how totally incompetent the opposition are, with their own document-it is a document you put out with a photograph of the former minister in it-and totally wrong. And you are using it this afternoon as the big blockbuster. To hear from the company itself: The document makes reference to Bligh Ventures Limited on page 10, stating that the Company expended $3,394,000 on research and development in the 1993/94 financial year. This statement is totally incorrect. The 1994/95 Annual Report for Bligh Ventures Limited was audited by Coopers & Lybrand and is a public document. They are the same people who are associated with this document turned out by you lot. It continues: As evidenced by this report Bligh Ventures Limited did not expend any funds on Research and Development nor did it make any claim on the Government relating to Research and Development. It is quite clear. Mr O'Keefe interjecting",94
157,Mr MOORE,PRIME MINISTER,"I do not have to. The point is made. I now turn to a minute from the department in relation to it. It says: You have asked whether any reference to Bligh Ventures in Scoreboard '96, a draft of this report has been received from Coopers & Lybrand. There is no reference to Bligh Ventures this year. They have found the mistake, they have corrected their records and so the great blockbuster of the afternoon fell on its face because the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) is so incompetent. He rushed in here and it all fell over. Really and truly, you are a bunch of duds trying to make good over there on these things. It is an absolute disgrace. On these matters, I state again-because I think that has suitably refuted this great bombshell for the day-Bligh Ventures is a publicly listed company in which I have had a minority shareholding for many years. I own approximately 0.6 per cent. The company operates in a way similar to superannuation funds, unit trusts and other capital investors, that is, it operates totally-I repeat, totally-at arm's length from their investments. It does not itself manufacture anything, . grow anything or develop anything. I am in no way involved in the day-today operations of the company. I take no part whatsoever in the operations or the management of it. I am not and never have been a director. I am not in a position to know the current trading activities of Bligh Ventures. Between the annual reports I have no knowledge of the decisions of management. I am no different in this respect to members of superannuation funds or holders of life policies. Bligh Ventures, to the best of my knowledge, is not involved in any activity which would involve a conflict of interest with me. My holdings-as most of Australia is now aware-are for sale, and have been since May. I have complied at all times with the spirit and intent of the guidelines and my ministerial responsibility. I make those points because during the 24 hours since we last met here to run through this, the same series of Labor lies have been out there again, misconstruing the facts. Smears, innuendos-all those sorts of things are around, alleging all sorts of things. There is no doubt the old pedlars are out there on the radios telling all sorts of funny stories. When you think of that, what went through my mind was the many Labor scandals of the last few years. There were endless scandals associated with the Labor Party and you never found former Senator Richardson far away from it. And then in 1994 we had",95
158,Unknown,PRIME MINISTER,Opposition members interjecting,95
159,Mr MOORE,PRIME MINISTER,That doesn't worry me. It wasn't my problem. In 1994 we had the question of a former industry minister who mapaged to get party funds mixed up with a sandwich shop. Remember that one? Opposition members-He resigned!,95
160,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! Members on my left!,95
161,Mr MOORE,PRIME MINISTER,"And then, as the Prime Minister pointed out, we had the Marks Royal Commission which very effectively named a minister as a public liar, and you did nothing about it at all. You sat there because you were not game to do anything. Leadership was lacking. You would not do a thing. The very things that you are telling the Prime Minister, you were not prepared to do. It is all a matter of record. As to what went on with Ros Kelly and the member for KingsfordSmithMr O'Keefe interjecting",95
162,Mr SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The member for Burke. Are you here for the vote?,95
163,Mr MOORE,PRIME MINISTER,The things that went on with Ros Kelly and the things withOpposition members-She resigned!,96
164,Mr MOORE,PRIME MINISTER,"That doesn't matter. These are all scandals associated with you. The cabinet subcommittee consisting of Dawkins and Button really did handle a very difficult situation of great benefit to themselves. These are the sorts of things you say around the bench. But, to top it all off, you had the previous Prime Minister sitting out there. He takes up a magnificent loan as Treasurer only to fall down as Prime Minister. That is not bad. As a result of that, the stain very much rests on your side of the House. While the scandals were going on, look what you were doing with the management of t?e economy . You ran record unemployment nght across the board. Yoli ran record debts around the place. You ran record unemployment. You ran record debts. You taxed Australians to the hilt. You went out of your way to be completely insensitive to the employment situation in Australia. At all times you completely missed the point while you were for Australia. totally looking after your own affairs. Mr Brereton interjecting",96
165,Mr MOORE,PRIME MINISTER,The censure motion today of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) completely misses the point. He has set out at all times to ensure that the standards of government are raised considerably from the past and the scandals which you visited upon Australia. Mr Brereton interjecting,96
166,Mr MO,PRIME MINISTER,"RE-As a consequence of that, Adams, D. G. H. you have mIssed the point. All the principal Andren, P. J. issues that were raised today by you and the Beazley, K. C.

173,Mr MOORE,PRIME MINISTER,"Mr Speaker, what I was referring to before all the ruckus broke out was that the censure motion moved this afternoon against the Pr.ime Minister is absolutely groundless. All the king hits they came out with have failed the test. The allegations they have made in relation to ministerial propriety have failed the test. What the Prime Minister has set out to do in raising the standards of parliament in Australia is totally correct, and he is to be commended for it. I hope that in the future all governments will follow the same line to ensure the high standards of public morality that are required.

174,Mrs BISHOP,AYES QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,": Mr Speaker, I have a question that I want to ask of you and it relates to the way in which a matter ought to NA be handled. Previously, when I was a member of the Senate, I was threatened by the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the House with being garrotted. Today I have been threatened by Mr Brereton, the member for Kingsford-Smith. I find that sort of behaviour offensive. He also threatened a colleague of mine in this place, and I wonder if you could advise me whether or not that behaviour is acceptable in this place. I suggested on the last occasion that the then Senator Gareth Evans required psychiatric treatment. Perhaps I could say the same to Mr Brereton.",97
175,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Threatening or otherwise offensive behaviour is something that will not be tolerated in this House. It has been the practice of all of my predecessors to rule Jeanes, S. B. accordingly. I was totally unaware of the issue today but, in the event that the member for Kingsford-Smith has offended the minister, I would like to hear his side of the story. Mrs Bishop-I would like an apology.",97
176,Mr BRERETON,NOES,"Mr Speaker, there will be no apology from me. What I invited the honourable minister to do was, if she wanted to cast aspersions about me in this chamber, to use the forms of the House and not asides across the chamber.",97
177,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! We are not going to debate the issue.,97
178,Mrs BISHOP,NOES,I do not wish to debate the matter. Opposition members. I bet you don't!,97
179,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! It is a very serious topic.,97
180,Mrs BISHOP,NOES,"Yes, I do. Please invite me, PAIRS and I will tell you precisely what I said.",97
181,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Minister, we are not debating the issue.",97
182,Mrs BISHOP,NOES,"I would like to tell you, Mr Speaker, the words that were said to me. They were, 'Mention Botany Council again, and I'll get you.' They were the words, Mr Speaker. It went on to be more menacing. I would like to ask you this, Mr Speaker. In the previous place when I was threatened with being garrotted, I said that the person required psychiatric treatment. I would simply like an apology from this member for Kingsford Smith. Furthermore, I would like an apology for the fact that he also threatened, in a physical way, one of my colleagues who was sitting on the front bench as well.",97
183,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,NOES,"Further to the comments of the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, I would just like to say that the member for Kingsford-Smith did come across the chamber and threaten me. Mr Leo MCLeay-Threatened you?",98
184,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! These are very serious allegations.,98
185,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,NOES,"Mr Speaker, I think it does deserve an apology, because I feel that it is not appropriate behaviour for this place.",98
186,Mr BRERETON,NOES,"The honourable minister during the last debate across the chamber made a number of motions suggesting impropriety on my part. I do not intend to re-enact the motions, but they were very apparent to all of his colleagues who were sitting around him. I merely went across the chamber and invited him, if he had something to say or an allegation to make about me, to use the forms of the House. I said that he should be a man and do so. I repeat that: be a man. Do what you should do, and do it in accordance with the forms of the House-not as a gutless wonder.",98
187,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! In the absence of a substantive motion and in the light of the long and distinguished career that the member for Kingsford-Smith has had in both the parliament of New South Wales and here, I give the member an opportunity to apologise if, upon reflection, he feels he has transgressed the normal standards of behaviour that one would expect in this House. Otherwise, there will be no further debate unless I have a substantive motion. Has the member had time to reflect?",98
188,Mr BRERETON,NOES,"I have nothing to apologise for. I certainly have not threatened anyone. I repeat that both of these ministers should use the forms of the House that are well known to them, and that is by way of a substantive motion in accordance with the rules of debate in this House. Missing Property",98
189,Mr SAWFORD,NOES,"Mr Speaker, I just make a request to you. I have had some information removed from my desk, and I would like the person who took it to hand it back. Mr Leo MCLeay interjecting",98
190,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I think we have resolved your dilemma. Codes of Conduct,98
191,Mr MARTIN,NOES,"Mr Speaker, I wonder if you might inform the House of the present status of the code of conduct for members and senators and the code of conduct for ministers and Presiding Officers documents, which were developed in the last parliament by a working group consisting of representatives of all parties and Independent members and senators and chaired jointly by the former Speaker and President of the Senate. Could you ascertain whether the government intends to provide an opportunity for all members to debate these proposals and perhaps adopt them in this parliament, particularly in the light of recent concern in the broader community about parliamentary standards and conflicts of interest?",98
192,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,I thank the member for Cunningham very much for his very timely intercession in the light of developments not only in perceptions outside but in this parliament today. I will reflect on the matter and advise the House and the member shortly. NA,98

197,Mr FAHEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In this morning's Australian Financial Review there were articles on page 1 and page 4 which stated that I held ownership and shares in two private companies.

I held two manag;ment shares out of 10,000 shares in my capacity as SOlicitor. advising in the establishment of that busmess. I never received any benefit from that compa-y, and I signed the transfer of those shares m 1993, but it would appear that the document was not lodged with the Australian Securities Commission. The second company, Tunboa Pty Ltd, was a private service company associated with my former legal practice. I transferred my interest in that company to my former partner in 1986 when I sold my interest in that legal practice. I have no entitlement in this company and have received no benefit since departing from the legal practice over 10 years ago. My former partner informed me last night that he has utilised the company in connection with his family trust and apologised for not correcting the ASC records. I have signed today the necessary forms for that to occur. These are two private companies which have never given rise to any conflict of interest. I informed the reporter from the Australian Financial Review of that last night. It would appear he had already filed his story.

The motivation for developing this policy stems from this government's election commitment to ensure the needs of people in rural and remote Australia are not forgotten. Unfortunately, often what makes good policy sense in a metropolitan context is impractical and unworkable in the country. Government must take account of this fact and frame policy accordingly. This is what the people of Australia who elected us, especially those in rural and remote areas, expect us to do. This policy is a down payment on the coalition government's commitment to meet the requirements of veterans living in rural and remote areas. Of the 337,000 veterans, war widows and dependants currently entitled to health care through my department, over 31 per cent live outside the major metropolitan areas. It is in areas with smaller popUlations and in the remote locations that the problems are greatest. They often have none of the services the rest of us take for granted. In addition, although health care services may be lacking close to home, veterans may have considerable difficulty in travelling to the larger centres to receive appropriate care. The majority of veterans are now aged over 70 years. This ageing is creating further demand for a wider range of health care and support services. The veteran community also includes many younger veterans who served in Korea, Malaya, Vietnam and in more recent engagements including UN peacekeeping missions. Their needs and those of carers and indigenous veterans are quite different from those of older veterans. This government is committed to honouring the debt of gratitude owed to those who fought for today's freedom. Rural Australia was a great source of recruitment. It is an important goal of this government to ensure equity of access and entitlement to all veterans regardless of where they live. This Health Policy for the Veteran Community in Rural and Remote Areas goes a great distance in achieving this goal. This policy: sets out the broad strategic directions and strategies to build on and enhance programs to target services better; outlines initiatives to specifically address service gaps, and builds in better feedback and planning mechanisms to meet the needs of the veteran community. In short, this policy spells out what we can do to make health care services easier to get to, to promote awareness of preventive care measures and to improve our communications with the veteran community and health care providers. The policy looks to the total health service delivery framework including Commonwealth and state governments, private and community-based organisations, and looks to capitalise on opportunities for joint arrangements with them. This policy is about what is achievable and realistic. It comes up with practical solutions that we can implement now within budget constraints. It flags what we can do in future to enhance provision of health care for rural and remote veterans. It is, however, just the first stage. Underpinning the development of this policy are wide ranging consultations with veterans, war widows, doctors, nurses, other health and community care providers, carers, ex-service organisations and others in Rockhampton, Thursday Island, Roma, Alice Springs, Bunbury, Geraldton, Cobar, Bourke and Echuca. Consultations made clear that, veterans living in rural and remote areas cannot and generally do not expect to have the same level and range of locally available health care services as people who live in cities. The policy acknowledges this reality but, through better focusing and targeting of programs and services, I believe the veteran community can still expect the best possible deal. Outlined in this policy are national, state and local initiatives, many of which are pilots, testing innovative approaches to service delivery and information provision. These have the potential to become the basis of practical, cost-effective, on-the-ground solutions right across the country. I would now like to highlight a few examples of some of the initiatives. The veteran community told us that access to health care and support services is an issue of concern. At a national level my department will: establish joint arrangements with state government health departments and individual providers to extend visiting specialist schemes, and increase visits by allied health professionals; extend provision of medical services through the Royal Flying Doctor Service, the RFDS, including: - links between RFDS psychological services and the Vietnam Veterans' Counselling Services and - providing annual health care plans by RFDS medical practitioners for veterans. At the local and state levels: the rural medication review program in Bundaberg, Roma and Wagga Wagga to improve pharmaceutical use and reduce adverse drug reactions will be expanded, and we will extend the rural psychiatric service which currently operates in Dubbo to other areas in NSW. Convenient and affordable transport is obviously important for access to services, especially if those services are not available locally. Nationally, I have asked my department to: ensure that guidelines for long distance travel for treatment are administered to take account of personal needs, and provide financial assistance to the accompanying person, where a veteran or war widow's medical condition requires him or her to be accompanied to travel for treatment. At the local level: community care seeding grants will be used in Portland and Belmont in rural Victoria to evaluate trials of community transport models. Health education and preventive care are important in improving veterans' and war widows' quality of life and reducing the need for more intensive health care. Among the proposed national initiatives are: the development of national health promotion products including a video to assist in the early detection and management of prostate disease, materials to assist management of chronic health conditions such as dementia, arthritis and back care. At the state and local levels: veterans health promotion activities and quality of life education programs will be arranged in rural areas; a pilot walking program will be developed in Burra, South Australia, for veterans and local school children, and through the telefriend program, isolated or housebound veterans in South Australia will be encouraged to become more involved through links to other veterans across the state. To improve the planning and delivery of my department's services, we need to improve our knowledge of the local needs and circumstances of the veteran community in different rural and remote areas. Our strategy is to extend the country visits and outreach programs and identify opportunities for joint arrangements such as one-stop shops with other government and community organisations. Specifically, we will: conduct a program of teams made up of my department's officers to consult with the local veteran community, health providers, community and government organisations. These teams will develop local strategies and provide information about the full range of the department's services. For example, during 1996 and 1997, these teams will visit Thursday Island, Bamaga, Miles, Cunnamulla, Alice Springs, Marrawah and Mallacoota; additional Veterans Advice Network services will be established. Another major issue to emerge was information or the lack thereof. Veterans and war widows are not always aware of their health care and support entitlements and nor are their health care providers. To address these concerns, at the national level: an information package about entitlements and health services will be published; a rural section will be included in the department's national newspaper for veterans, Vetaffairs; and locally: . a pilot three-day Veterans Information Expo will be conducted in Mackay. Through consultations we found that there are groups within the veteran community with special needs including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander veterans, veterans with warrelated stress or mental health conditions, frail aged veterans and carers. Many frail aged veterans and war widows suffer from chronic illness or high levels of disability and, if unable to live independently, they often are obliged to move to a hostel or nursing home a great distance from family and friends. At a national level the department will: ensure that an appropriate proportion of funds for the residential care development scheme, community care seeding grants program and the joint venture scheme are directed to their residential and community care needs; and, at the local level: a report will be prepared on the barriers and opportunities which may affect the veteran community in achieving equitable allocations of residential services in rural and remote areas of South Australia. I am particularly concerned about the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander veterans who made a significant contribution to the defence of Australia during WorId War Two. In the Torres Strait alone, we know that almost every male of enlistment age signed up. Among other national initiatives, I have asked my department to: in the first place identify them and then raise awareness among Aboriginal veterans of their entitlements through contact with, and provision of information to, Aboriginal organisations and communities. For veterans in the Torres Strait, we will: improve access for veterans to rehabilitation appliance program items; and financially support the Queensland Department of Health in establishing a podiatry service on Thursday Island to assist those veterans with chronic illnesses such as diabetes. Veterans who suffer from dementia, warrelated stress and other mental health conditions very often have an especially difficult time in getting the services they need in rural and remote locations, where their conditions may be exacerbated by isolation. Specifically, the National Centre for War Related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder will be used to enhance care for veterans in rural and remote areas by: researching the care needs and effectiveness of PTSD treatment; arranging continuing education seminars and workshops for providers, for example, in Tamworth and Armidale; and further developing access arrangements to PTSD treatment programs including for veterans in the Swan Hill and Mildura. Satellite PTSD programs will be introduced for the veteran community in country New South Wales. Carers playa major role within the veteran community and require support and access to respite care. Many veterans and even some of the carers themselves, suffer from chronic illnesses and disabilities. To help this group: a dementia training program for carers in the veteran community will be provided in 30 rural and remote centres; and, at the local level: the co-ordination of respite service in the Grafton region in NSW will be improved to enable veterans, their carers and professionals to call one number to access all residential and in-home respite places in the region. Health care providers in rural communities play a critical role, and are often the major source of health service information for veterans. It is essential they are given the most appropriate support. Providers are often not fully aware of Veterans' Affairs services and entitlements. My strategy is to assist them in giving the best possible quality care including better use of information technology. A recent survey of the department's health care providers found that nearly 70 per cent have an office computer and 17 per cent have access to the Internet. At a national level, my department will: provide information on the department's Internet home page and through its publications to increase awareness of veterans' health issues and health care servicesand guides will also be provided to other sources of information; advise LMOs about elements of the repatriation comprehensive care scheme and annual health care plans for veterans and other changes to DV A arrangements through a departmental news-sheet to be faxed regularly. Ex-service organisations too, provide valuable support to the veteran community, including home and hospital visiting, pensions and advocacy advice and a range of aged care services. Some rural sub-branches of ex-service organisations are now closing as membership declines, and others are reporting increased pressure on their welfare officers to provide information and advice on health and aged care matters. Over recent years these organisations have been supported through grants programs. This support will be extended by: increasing training provided to ex-service organisation personnel under the training information program in rural and remote areas; and reviewing and amending guidelines for grants programs to ensure an appropriate focus on rural and remote areas: health Initiatives at the local level include: supporting the development of new day clubs in the South Coast and Hunter Valley regions in New South Wales. In terms of housing, many veterans and war widows told us that they want to live independently in their local communities for as long as possible. As veterans age, their housing needs change and their homes may need alterations, repairs or maintenance to enable them to continue to live independently. In this area, my department will: in conjunction with Westpac, examine better options for people living in rural and remote areas to take up their entitlement to defence service home loans to enable modifications. Locally: a project in the Goldfields region of Western Australia will be established in association with community organisations, to provide regular telephone contact at times of special need, such as on discharge from hospital, for those living alone, and a project on home safety and security in the W odonga area to provide veterans with an assessment of risks in their homes. Advice will be given on preventive action to reduce the likelihood of home accidents and to enhance veterans' ability to live independently. Financial independence can have a major impact on veterans and war widows' general well-being. Many are not fully aware of their entitlements and find the assessment process complex and difficult. I have asked my department to investigate ways of improving this situation by looking at possibilities such as providing a single point of contact for veterans about these matters. This policy shows how the government can expand its role in this area to better meet the needs of the veteran community. By focusing our attention and thinking about how solutions can meet local problems, we can do more. In concluding, I want to stress that the policy highlights what we know we can proceed with now and flags future plans. It represents the first phase of a long-term strategy. I want to take this opportunity also to thank my parliamentary colleagues Trish Worth, Kay Elson, Mal Brough and Sharman Stone, who so willingly became involved in the consultations with the veteran community and their health care providers in Western Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. I also want to thank the local members for areas as far flung as Thursday Island and Alice Springs. Most of all, I want to express my warmest appreciation to the many veterans, war widows, doctors, nurses and other health care providers in the isolated regions of Australia who extended their hospitality to all those people involved in the consultations and who gave us such valuable insights. This document is about finding ways to improve the lives of veterans and war widows who live in rural and remote Australia by giving them practical information, better access to health care services and innovative solutions to some specific problems. In conclusion, I would also like to acknowledge the presence of the members of my department from the national office who are in the gallery and also in the advisers box here, and who worked tirelessly on this document. They have been the people who have coordinated all the research that had been done. They certainly have worked, I believe, above and well beyond the call of duty. When members on both sides of the House read the document that I am about to table, they will find that it is a very practical way of assisting a very special section of our community. I commend this Health Policy for the Veteran Community in Rural and Remote Areas to the House. I present the following paper: Health Policy Jor the Veteran Community in Rural and Remot Areas-Ministerial Statement, 16 October 1996.",100
215,Mr MARTIN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Cunningham) (5.12 p.m.)by leave-At the outset, I echo the sentiments of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) in congratulating the DV A personnel and those people who are here. I know that departmental staff work long and hard to produce documents onÂ· behalf of governments and this is no exception. This is a fine document which the minister and the department have overseen and I lend my congratulations to them at the outset. I also extend the minister's congratulations to two further colleagues in the consultation process, the members for Mallee (Mr Forrest) and Lyne (Mr Vaile), who I understand were involved as well. During the minister's statement, those in cockies comer were rather excited about the fact that many of the pilot projects announced by the minister today in fact were going to occur in their electorates. Mr Bruce Scott-Hunter Valley, too.",105
216,Mr MARTIN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I did interject that earlier, Minister. The document which the minister has released, and which he gave me some access to earlier this afternoon, is indeed an excellent document in terms of drawing together those programs and those initiatives which have been announced in the budget and which have specifically targeted those people in rural and regional areas and remote areas. There is no doubt, as the minister has said, that many people-and veterans of course are specifically catered for in. this statementliving in those sorts of areas do have difficulties of access. They do have difficulties in the most basic forms of access to information. What the minister has announced today-with some of the extensions of the programs and pilot projects which he has also announcedhopefully will address many of those sorts of issues. The fact that closer working relationships are also being investigated between the Commonwealth and states and local government and community organisations is a very logical extension of the way in which the various levels of government and community organisations that work in these areas bring some degree of information certainly, but also a degree of service, to veterans living in these areas. It is a very commendable suggestion. There is no doubt that, when you look at opportunities to perhaps have one-stop shops-as the minister has rightly describedwhere veterans might come from more remote areas to larger urban environments, they certainly have access to those sorts of sources of information and also expert advice in a whole range of areas, whether it be in health or in entitlements. The minister again uses an example of some of the benefits that perhaps people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background have not really accessed at this stage. I think it is important that that sort of information is made available. Therefore, the fact that what the minister has announced is encapsulated in this one document is also very important. It is all part of a process where the communities in rural and remote areas of Australia do get equal access to information and do get equal access to the provision of services, whether it be medical advice, specialist attention or whatever. The minister indicated in his speech that most veterans today are around 70 or 75 years of age, with the exception of those who fought in the Korean war and those who fought more recently in Vietnam, in the Gulf conflict or wherever. There is no doubt that many of those people do require some special services. There is no doubt that as people get older they do require a much higher level of care and there is a need for much greater responsibility being taken for them. The veterans system, which has been developed in this country at a bipartisan level over many years, I think is certainly the best in the Western world, if not the world, and offers support for those people that have given so much on behalf of their country. The goals which have been outlined in the minister's statement are very commendable indeed. I note that a number of the proposals he has outlined are pilot projects. I would hope that if those pilot projects prove to be successful then the information which the minister and his department gain will form the basis of the minister's submissions in coming ERe rounds next year leading up to the budget so that he can achieve what he did this time with some extension of funds to some programs in the area of veterans' affairs. If these projects in rural and remote Australia prove to be successful, then there is no reason to say that those principles need not apply in other parts of Australia. Having spoken with the minister about these processes in the past, I think he probably has that idea in mind where, looking at the information that does come from the pilot projects, he will be able to do so. As I said, I think some of the accesses that are going to be provided through a variety of mechanisms in this health policy, particularly picking up Vietnam veterans' counselling services, annual health care plans and so on, are very commendable. There is no doubt that these sorts of plans, the advice network which is established and the various other services which go into rural and remote areas are going to be well received. I will comment briefly on the transport question. I think it is important that we recognise that whereas in urban environments, in major cities, the transport issue is not of major concern, clearly in rural and remote Australia it is. Whilst people in their twilight years do try to stay as long as they possibly can in their own accommodation, regrettably there may come a time when they need to have the benefit of nursing homes, hostel care or whatever. They get the best of that because of the system that is provided in this country. If you live in an urban environment, clearly you have a greater access to those facilities. On the other hand, if you are in rural and remote areas often it does mean tearing yourself away from family, friends and loved ones and going many miles away from what is your own known and local environment. The concept the minister outlined in his statement about providing transport options and so on to assist people as part of that process I think is very commendable. There is no doubt that, as I have said, this policy is one which will be welcomed by all veterans in rural and remote areas of Australia. There is no doubt that it is something we on this side of the House certainly welcome. Regrettably, there are not as many members on this side of the House from rural and remote Australia these days as perhaps we would like-I fully understand why the people you commended in terms of who you consulted with came from your side of the parliament-but there is no doubt that a number of our senators in particular that do look after rural and remote Australia will welcome this policy statement. I think it is something we in this parliament will all commend you for. Let me conclude where I started, by again saying that policy statements such as this, where the bipartisan nature of the veterans' affairs portfolio can be demonstrated, make it easy to accept recommendations that flow from them. I thank the minister for making the policy statement available to me for a couple of hours before he tabled it-actually a little longer because of the proceedings of the House today, which gave me a chance to read it several times. It has proven to be a great initiative and I commend him and the government for taking this step. NA",105

218,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This is the principal bill in a package of three bills which implement a number of the government's important policy initiatives within the immigration and multicultural affairs portfolio. The measures contained within the bill are consistent with the government's commitments to better manage the migration program, to increase cost recovery in this portfolio and to enhance the value of Australian citizenship. Firstly, this bill seeks to provide the ment with the authority to deliver a planned, orderly and balanced migration program. To be able to do so, the government must have the authority to determine the number of people in each category of the migration program. This is not possible under the current legislation. It is Australia's sovereign right to decide the total level of immigration to Australia. It is also Australia's sovereign right to decide the balance between the various immigration categories. The proposed amendments will enable the government of the day to determine, if necessary, the number of people in every migration category able to enter Australia each year. The amendments will thus assist the government to implement its migration program, announced on 3 July, and will contribute to the restoration of the balance between the family and skilled streams PAIRS of the program. This is crucial to restoring public confidence in the immigration program, which had been greatly eroded under Labor.",108
219,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,The thing you said was unconscionable.,108
220,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Mr Andrew)Order! I have ignored the member for Denison's interjection on three occasions.,108
221,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I note the interjections, which, of course, reflect the unwillingness of the opposition to join the government in ensuring that the very modest reductions in the immigration program, which ought to be in place, will be able to be achieved. It demonstrates the lack of commitment of this opposition to those program numbers. In the context of the Lindsay by-election, which we are going to be dealing with in a very short period of time, it demonstrates the unwillingness of this opposition to grasp very reasonable prospects to ensure that this migration program can be delivered in the way in which it has been announced. This bill will test your metal in relation to these matters. Members will recall that in 1995-96, Labor allowed the immigration program to get seriously out of control and out of balance. The family stream had grown by 27 per cent in 1995-96. It had come to represent almost 70 per cent of the migration program. The governspouse category had grown by 32 per cent, and the number of parents had increased by 74 per cent in that year alone. I have already announced a series of measures to ensure greater integrity in the family stream of the migration program. These measures are designed to bring the family stream back under control. That is something obviously that the opposition is not prepared to do. Mr Kerr interjecting",108
222,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,Order! The member for Denison will have an opportunity later in the debate to participate and to give his points of view. The minister for immigration has the call.,108
223,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"There is evidence that these measures. are beginning to have an impact, and I am hopeful that there will be only a limited need to use all of the additional powers being sought in these amendments. However, even the best planning cannot predict every possible variation in the number of visa applications that will be made for many different visa classes. It is for this reason that, from time to time, the governunfairly ment will need to finetune the numbers each category. These amendments will enhance to manage the program by allowing applications to be carried over into the next financial year. The only mechanism currently available requires the termination of existing applicamigration tions. The new provisions would have the effect that, in some years, visa issue in some parts of the family stream may be queued the following year. This is a much more applicants, equitable outcome for these parts of the program. In order to minimise inconvenience to the bulk of persons affected, it is essential the government can undertake this finetuning in the most flexible and equitable manner possible. It is therefore important that the government has flexibility in the types limits applied and the ability to change them sition. at any time. This bill will achieve this objective. I note that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has indicated that the opposition supports the level of the program the government has announced. The achieve the ment of that program level, and the restoration of the balance between the family and skilled categories that is the key to communiperiod ty support for the program, requires all the measures contained in this bill. If the opposiof tion is not prepared to support these sensible measures it will be clear to all that they not serious about achieving a well managed and well structured migration program. As recently reiterated by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the government is committed to a migration program that operates on a non-discriminatory basis. The at measures in this bill are completely consistent with that principle and enable the government to deliver a planned, orderly and balanced migration program. The government is concerned at evidence that too many visas in the past have been granted on the basis of relationships that are not bona fide. Such abuse threatens the integrity of the migration program by allow the ing the entry of people who would not otherwise be eligible for migration. It also operates by taking up places in the migration in program which might otherwise have been given to people who satisfy the criteria for the ability other visa classes. The coalition's immigration policy statement clearly signalled our intention to introduce measures to reduce the abuse of based on fabricated or non-bona fide relationships. These measures are the extension of the current two-year probationary into period for onshore applicants to offshore limiting serial sponsorships, more rigorous assessment procedures, and requiring a two-year cohabitation period for de facto .and interdependency relationships. Each of that these measures is integral to the overall success of the package in reducing abuse of Australia's migration program. To fail to pass anyone measure puts at risk the government's of migration program numbers and its compoA key feature of migration entitlements based upon relationships must be that those involved have a long-term commitment to each other. Short term or transitory relationships should not provide non-Australians with lifelong right to live in Australia. It is therefore a major defect in the existing legislation that it does not impose a minimum of cohabitation in order for people to qualify for a visa to migrate on the grounds being the de facto spouse of an Australian citizen sponsor. As a result, visa applications are are being made where couples have only been together for short periods, sometimes only a matter of a few weeks. Such relationships can provide very little evidence of the necessary absolutely long-term commitment. An evaluation of onshore spouse provisions the beginning of this year provided empirical evidence that this is an area of concern, with de facto relationships being twice as likely as de jure marriages to break down during visa processing alone. The government considers that requiring evidence of a relationship that has existed for at least two years is necessary to ensure that only couples who have already demonstrated their long-term commitment can be granted a visa. The provisions in the bill will enable regulations to be made establishing a two-year cohabitation requirement and enabling exceptions to occur to that requirement where there are good reasons for doing so. For example, the government does not propose to require two years' cohabitation if there are children from the relationship. The government considers that it is unnecessary to impose a two-year requirement on married couples because of the different legal consequences of marriage. This amendment will mean that the migration regulations will be able to specify the nature and incidents of the relationship between two people which are required to establish a 'de facto' relationship, notwithstanding the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. It was outlined in the coalition's election commitment that de facto spouses will be required to cohabit for a period of two years before their relationship can be recognised for the purpose of visa applications. As there will be no similar requirement for married spouses, such a provision would create a distinction on the grounds of marital status, and this is presently prohibited by the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. This amendment will exempt the migration regulations from the effect of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in so far as it applies to the status or condition of being the married or the de facto spouse of another person. I note that, in relation to the grant of visas, interdependency relationships are not covered by the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 or any other equivalent Commonwealth legislation. As a result, no amendments are required to principal legislation to enable regulations to be made requiring a minimum two-year cohabitation period for those relationships. The government believes that the mischief of bogus and short-term relationships is sufficiently serious to warrant an exception being made to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 for visa applications based on de facto spouse relationships. We believe that this measure will contribute to the range of initiatives we are taking to renew public confidence in the integrity of this component of the migration program. I shall now tum to the provisions relating to the proposed visa application charge. The government considers that the present system of payments for Australian visas is unnecessarily complex. Not only is there a visa application fee, but some applicants are also liable to pay the English education charge and the health services charge. These fees and charges are imposed and collected under three separate pieces of legislation. The present system also imposes a burden on Australian taxpayers because the indirect costs to government of handling visa applications and providing post-settlement services cannot be recovered on a fee for service basis. This means that a proportion of government services that are provided to visa applicants are currently funded from general taxation. This situation is not consistent with the government's stated election policy that 'the coalition endorses ... cost recovery of immigration procedures and services ... to ensure that taxpayers are not called on to subsidise the processing of applications for migration.' The government proposes to simplify the processing of payments for visa applications by implementing a single visa application charge that will be payable by applicants for visas. This will be imposed by the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996. The new charge will replace the existing system of visa application fees, the English education charge and the health services charge. The new scheme is very closely modelled on the existing charge schemes, which were introduced by the previous government. Valid visa applications that are made before the commencement of the visa application charge will continue to be subject to the existing fee and charging arrangements. The visa application charge is designed to recover both direct and indirect costs of processing visa applications, and to recover an increased proportion of the cost of providing postarrival and settlement services to permanent visa holders. The amount of the charge will be prescribed in the migration regulations and will be subject to the ceiling set out in the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996. A similar legislative ceiling mechanism is already in use for both of the charges that currently apply to visa applications. The regulations will reflect the fee and charges settings already announced in the budget context. . There will be appropriate flexibility to exempt certain persons from the application charge, or from part of the application charge. In some circumstances, such as refugee and humanitarian applicants, the charge will be nil. The regulations will also provide for waiver of the charge and for refunds in appropriate circumstances. The bill also amends the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 to ensure that a person is permitted to have only one entitlement of up to 510 hours of English language tuition under that act. The final measures in this bill relate to Australian citizenship. The government is strongly committed to recognising the national significance of Australian citizenship. It represents our commitment to a common future and formal membership of the Australian community, and brings with it the responsibilities and privileges of that membership. The government remains firmly committed to the general principle that a person granted citizenship after making a full and frank disclosure of all relevant factors should be on an equal footing with any other Australian citizens. But the government is equally determined that the value of Australian citizenship should not be undermined by allowing the grant of citizenship to stand where it has been granted as the result of fraud or deception. Yet the current provisions for deprivation of Australian citizenship in these circumstances are limited. There is currently no provision for depriving a person of Australian citizenship if it obtained by fraud at the time of immigration. For example, a person who migrated to Australia on spouse grounds cannot be deprived of citizenship if it is later discovered that there was never any intention of a genuine union. Also, a person who committed fraud when applying for citizenship cannot be deprived of that citizenship if prosecution for the fraud is not commenced within ten years of its occurrence. The government considers that this is unacceptable. People should not be able to hide behind Australian citizenship which was obtained following fraud. To allow them to do so weakens the meaning and value of Australian citizenship. Therefore, in accordance with the government's pre-election policy commitment, the proposed amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 and the Migration Act 1958 will allow deprivation, without time limitation, of future grants of Australian citizenship obtained as a result of fraud, whether at the time of immigration or of application for citizenship. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerr) adjourned. MIGRATION (VISA APPLICATION) CHARGE BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",108
224,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is part of a package of three bills which will rationalise and bring together the charging legislation relating to visa applications. The structure of the new charge scheme is closely modelled on the existing charge schemes that apply to visa applications, but will permit recovery of the indirect costs associated with processing visa applications and the provision of post-arrival services to was permanent visa holders. The new scheme will also ensure greater administrative efficiency by consolidating into a single charge act the visa application fee and charges that are currently imposed by three separate pieces of legislation. This bill imposes a single visa application charge and establishes a ceiling of $12,500 for the maximum amount of charge that may be prescribed in the regulations. The ceiling is subject to an indexation formula based on annual movements in the consumer price index. The ceiling has been designed to cover the most expensive visa applications, but the great majority of applicants will pay a much lower amount that will be broadly comparable to the current fees and chargesÂ· plus some increases to recover costs which are not currently recovered. The amount of charge that is paid by a visa applicant will be prescribed in the Migration Regulations which comprehensively govern the processing of visa applications. The act is planned to commence on 1 January 1997. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerr) adjourned. IMMIGRATION (EDUCATION) CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL J996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",111
225,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill forms part of a package of three bills that will rationalise the existing system of fees and charges applying. to visa applications. The bill amends the Immigration (Education) Charge Act 1992 to ensure that the English education charge will no longer apply to visa applications that are made after the introduction of the visa application charge that is imposed by the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996. The amendment is necessary in order to provide a smooth transition to the new visa application chargeÂ·scheme. People who made valid visa applications before the introduction of the application charge will not be liable to pay the visa application charge but will remain liable to pay the existing English education charge. The English education charge is prescribed by regulations which are subject to a statutory ceiling. The bill will increase this ceiling to $5,500-:-a figure which more accurately reflects the true cost of providing English language tuition to migrants who do not have functional English. The raised ceiling is consistent with the government's election commitment to achieve greater cost recovery for migration-related services. It will apply to all applicable outstanding visa applications that were made before the introduction of the visa application charge and which had not received an assessment notice for English education charge. These applications are liable to pay English education charge under the existing arrangements but the ceiling is now somewhat lower than cost recovery. Applications which have already received an assessment notice will not be affected by any increase in the English education charge made by regulations under the new ceiling. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerr) adjourned.",112

239,Mr MOSSFIELD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"When my speech on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill was interrupted prior to question time, I was referring to information provided by the New South Wales Minister for Education and Training, the Hon. John Aquilina. My speech related to cuts in funding to T AFE. About 40,000 of these students would have been attending labour market program courses in TAFE institutions outside Sydney during the next four years. In country areas, where the majority of labour market programs were run by TAFE, unemployment runs from two to five times the urban rate. T AFE institutes statewide have estimated that the cuts in labour market programs will cost each of them between $2 million and $6 million this financial year. Institutes can expect to lose between $1 million and $2 million per year in salaries and operating costs. TAFE campuses will also suffer from a $25 million total reduction in funds for building works during the next three years. The funding cuts to TAFE will clearly add severe strains to a system which is beginning to buckle under the loss of labour market programs. To further emphasise the point, I again refer to information provided by the New South Wales state Minister for Education and Training. The document is a press release, and it reads: With the termination of funding from DEETYA set at December 1997, it appears likely that class group funding will be most severely affected. Such cuts would have most impact on the following areas across the state:Business Services, particularly Office Administration and Retail Trade areas such as Plumbing, Electrical trades, Automotive and Engineering Services Personal and Community Service areas such as Childcare, Welfare Tourism and Hospitality Rural and Mining in the areas of Horticulture and Floristry Special Intervention Program areas such as English for Vocational Programs, ESOL, Adult Further Education (literacy/numeracy/science). That is a fairly big impact. Many of the activities of TAFE in training our young people both in direct courses and in labour market programs associated courses must now be under great threat. We simply will be unable to expect TAFE to deliver training programs to assist our young people into the work force when they are unable to provide staff and equipment to do so. Does the government perhaps wish to go back to another era when our grandfathers had to have their parents pay employers for the privilege of having an apprenticeship and be trained? Surely that is not in the Howard government's thinking. How are young people to get their training unless it is to become the sole responsibility of each set of parents? The numbers of have-nots are going to become greater and greater. Australia has been a marvellous country in the past and its people have never begrudged paying as a collective group for the collective gain of all its people. The new policies that are emerging via this bill and so many other parts of the government policies make it clear that what we are being redirected to think about is only 'What is in it for me?' and 'How can I get an advantage without helping my next door neighbour?' We are certainly sending some appalling signals across our shores as to what the 'new Australia' really is going to stand for. What must these exchange students think about this type of policy? There are many of them corning to Australia each year and living with host families, attending our high schools and learning about Australian culture. I was very proud to have with me at the House this week a young German exchange student, Ms Christina Schultz. Christina is attending the Evans High School. Her local host family are Mr and Mrs Richardson. There are dozens of these marvellous people all over Australia who are endeavouring to ensure that these students receive a good impression of Australia. Ms Schultz came here with STS High School Foundation, established in Australia 10 years ago. There are 100 students in various parts of Australia for one year. The founda-. tion operates in 19 countries. I wonder what type of impression Christina will take back to Germany of a country that is now becoming uncaring and so financially mercenary. What about the students at places like Evans High School at Blacktown, Blacktown Boys and Girls High, John Paul II and all the other 11 high schools in the electorate of Greenway or the 36 primary schools? What training future can they expect if TAFE is to be so cut and restricted? Are we now to expect that mum and dad are going to be slugged, that they will have to find buckets of money to pay for their children's TAFE training? Do the children now also have to go and try to negotiate a contract under the new workplace relations bill to earn a dollar to help mum and dad pay the TAFE fees? Can you just imagine the types of contracts that these young people will be forced to sign, born out of their desperation to get TAFE training? In its submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, the Brotherhood of St Laurence said: The very real problems for young unemployed is that there remain too few jobs for those who want to work and there appears to be little prospect of change in this situation. It is of enormous concern to us that the government seems to have abandoned its commitment to the goal of returning Australia to full employment and indeed has no targets for reducing unemployment. I believe that in this area of TAFE cuts it is clear that not only has the government abandoned the unemployed, as so eloquently stated by the Brotherhood of St Laurence, but it appears to have abandoned any pretence of support for a community supported training system in the long run. The government tries every economic trick in the book to fiddle the statistics in an attempt to hide its appalling behaviour in this area. But the fact remains that it has cut $66.25 million from vocational education training grants to the states and territories. It has reduced the Australian National Training Authority'S operating expenses by $12.81 million. There has also been a reduction of $91.41 million, representing the abolition of the five per cent real growth on base recurrent TAPE funding. This amounts to the challengeable figure of $170.5 million that this government has cut from vocational education and training. The government says that it supports traineeships and apprenticeships, yet in the traineeship area it shows up quite clearly that there is to be a steady cutting of funds area, as exposed in item 2 of schedule 1 of this bill. The Australian trainee system was one of the most imaginative schemes ever introduced in this country and has provided training and jobs in so many varied areas of Australian life for thousands of young people. Traineeships cover many occupations that were not previously covered by apprenticeships and were an excellent way for small business to train new employees in the specific skills those employers required. Now we are starting to wind it back. What an indictment of any government that allows such things to happen to the very people it pretends to care about-the young, the unemployed and the training hungry youth of this nation. Add to this the $1.8 billion cuts in labour market programs. No amount of wriggling or misuse of statistics can enable the government to escape from our scrutiny. One of the issues that has been raised in this debate by people on the other side has been unfair dismissals. They have failed to understand that, in the area of labour market programs, the new work opportunities and traineeships that fall under the national ing wage were not affected by the unfair dismissal provisions of the previous arbitration act. It is our intention to hold the government clearly responsible for the absolute downgrading of training for our young people seeking work and those who will be shortly seeking work. The debate on this bill, which exposes its cuts to TAFE and its many ramifications, enables us to expose its nonsense. I can assure the House that those who were so swayed by the Howard rhetoric prior to the election are now clearly regretting their decision to support the government. The problem for the government now is that it can no longer hide its meanness and unfair programs behind its attack on the previous government. It now has to stand up and be counted on its own policies and perfonnances. So far on every count-whether it be ministerial standards, child care, nursing homes, the unemployed, labour market programs, racial discrimination or TAPE training-it comes a miserable and lamented last, in this which is where it has always belonged.",113
240,Mr CHARLES,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"I rise tonight to address the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1996. Vocational education and training is a very important topic in the dying years of the 20th century. It is important for Australia because we need to do our very best to give our young people skills that will take them forward into the next century, skills that they can use in industry, skills which are portable, skills which are realistic and skills which are relevant. It seems to me that some of the things that we just heard from the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) need to be discussed. The member for Greenway says that this government has no object to increase employment and, in fact, it is acting to increase unemployment. I reject those comments in the strongest possible tenns. This government when it came to power found an untenable budget situation. Fair dinkum, how can you keep on year after year spending money that you do not earn? If the member for Greenway tried to run his housetrainhold that way, I think he would find that, firstly, he would lose his furniture, his lawn mower, his car, his TV set and then, finally, his house because you cannot keep spending forever what you have not earned, what you do not have. So we have to live within our means as a nation. If there is one thing that will help boost employment in this nation, it is to get high interest rates off our back, get high interest rates done and finished with. If we have to live with a high interest rate regime for the remaining years of the 1990s to 2000 and beyond, then we will find that industry, business and commerce simply give up the hard job of trying to expand their operations and trying to compete with companies overseas that supply the same products and the same services that they do. So business demands that we get our fiscal house in order. This is not something that is unique to Australia. The whole world is finally waking up to the fact that we cannot live with deficit spending forever. One of the objects of the budget, which the Treasurer (Mr Costello) brought down this year in August, is to try to address this problem that Labor left us. The legacy that Labor left us has built up year year in the 1990s, when the government spent more than it earned in taxation from all you Australians and Australian companies. It is long past time that we addressed it. So it is a responsible action, and it is one leg of the issue dealing with employment. If we want employment, we need private sector investment. We need industry, business and commerce to expand their operations to grow and to offer new employment opportunities. The second leg of that effort to reduce unemployment to provide more jobs is to provide a more flexible structure that 'encourcapital ages our youth to develop their skills. I have to say that the workplace relations bill, went through this House in June and which is now before the Senate, will have a huge impact in allowing our businesses to be more flexible in the way they go about providing training for both adults and youth. What this Vocational Education and Traintaking ing Funding Amendment Bill is all about providing the funding so that we can get with the job of training Australia. Everybody keeps talking about these massive cuts, but funding for 1996 has actually increased on what was allowed for by the ALP government that preceded us. Funding in 1997 will be increased on 1996, and funding in 1998 will be increased on 1997. The fact that Labor put some hypothetical figures in forward estimates of former years and that they were irresponsible to do so without the income to back it is our fault. We are responsibly fundil1g vocational education and training sector within the ability of the government to fund it and to provide increasing funds this next year and the year after. It seems to me that that is a highly responsible action. The whole issue of vocational education and training is one which, I think, is largely bipartisan in nature. There are some details that we argue about-and I will address some of those in my brief remarks tonight-but basically we all agree that, now that we have shifted retention rates in secondary schools Â·from 50 and 60 per cent up to 80 per cent, we need to do something about expanding our after year after skill base. If you go back and look at the Finn report, will recognise that it is iinpossible for us to send every young person to university, nor is every young person intellectually capable of coping with university life and the rigours of that study regime. We do not need all our young people to go to university in order to have a satisfying life, in order to have a dynamic and growing career, in order to achieve work which is of value to themselves, to the companies or governments they work for and to the nation. So this bill is about providing federal government funding for works and recurrent expenditure for vocational education and training. It is essenwhich tially by bipartisan agreement. When ANTA was conceived, it was done on the run. As I recall, the then Prime Minister got himself involved in this debate in 1992 ahead of the 1993 election. He finally came up with thisÂ· convoluted method of money from the states and putting it is into a new bureaucracy-the Australian on National Training Authority. The Commonwealth government put their money into the same bureaucracy, and then ANTA distributed the funds back to the states and to the individual TAFE organisations via the state. I was highly sceptical that this mechanism would be effective. In fact, it has worked, and I respect the work that ANTA does. They do a good job, and they are helping us to help the budgets in system devolve in nature. I recall that in 1990 we had a situation in not Victoria-where there were still highly buthe reaucratically organised T AFEs-where private providers were not recognised by the system at all. Even under a Labor governyear, ment, they started to move to gradually release the bureaucratic controls of the TAPE. Now our TAFEs in Victoria are basically institutions on their own, and those collegecan make their own decisions and run their own show. They can set up their own courses and their own curriculum. They can go out and do highly innovative things. I have mentioned before that the Outer Eastern College of TAFE, which is just on the border of my electorate, has done some highly innovative work with industry, for instance, with Mercedes Benz. Mercedes Benz paid Outer Eastern College of T AFE to design for them a training program for their assembly operation where they assemble trucks. Then Mercedes Benz turned around and paid TAFE instructors to leave the college, go to the plant itself, work on the assembly line itself, actually assembling trucks and training employees in asseffibly techniques. That was highly innovative. TAFE, in that institution, was acting as a private provider for a private company in order to enhance the skills of the private company's employees. I applaud them for that. We need flexible institutions. We need flexibility across the system. I recall that back in 1990 some of our private training institutions in Victoria trained apprentices or trainees and then had to send them off to TAFE in order to have them examined to see if they had learned what their curriculum was supposed to have taught them. It was an absolute nonsense. There was no reason on earth why the private provider could not be credentialled to certify what young people had achieved and what their skill levels were. ANTA receives the money and ANTA distributes it. It seems to me that what we have now is an increasingly flexible system, where states are starting to compete with each other for the prize of who is doing the job best, who can get more people into active training programs and who has real outputs that gets people real jobs. A couple of weeks ago I went to Melbourne University to help participate in the launch of a project there. I mention this because the TAFEs are now working with the universities on an upswing level. They are also working with the schools on a down level. The universities are increasingly working with both education sectors in order to help provide the practical educational input that is so necessary for so many of our young people. As I said before when I referred to the Finn report, we cannot send every child to university. So, if we aim to send 25 per cent or 30 per cent of our young people on to university, that is a wonderful objective. The rest need skills. They need some form of vocational education and training to allow them to get into real jobs, to be productive when they get there and to have the skills that employers want. What this government is all aboutparticularly with the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship system and some of the new innovative programs that we are putting into place-is increasing the flexibility of the system to allow people to do what they believe is best to achieve the highest outcome. An important ingredient in all of this is to give industry a real voice in curriculum, standards and what they expect of performers. It is a nonsense if we have one government financed institution-let us say, Oxblinn TAFE in Outer Woop Woopsaying, 'We know better than our employers what skills the young people need.' That is an attitude that has been around for a while. Thank goodness that attitude is disappearing rapidly. The TAFEs have woken up and realised that industry, business and commerce are the sectors hiring the people. They know what skills they need now, and they should have the vision to know what skills they are going to need in the future. The nature of work is changing so rapidly. The member for Greenway talked about our current inquiry into the factors influencing the employment of young people. Many people have told us that the whole nature of industry is shifting. I recall that the Banking and Insurance Industry Advisory Training Board came along and talked to us. One of the things that really fascinated me-I had not thought about it before-is that there are not very many jobs in the banking industry or in insurance offices any more. I recall that 20 years ago-and I am sure you do, Madam Deputy Speaker-if a young person left school at 15 or 16 they were almost assured employment in a bank or in an insurance office. As long as they had reasonable English skills and reasonable literary and numeracy skills, they could go along to a bank or an insurance office and learn to be a teller, a clerk or a clerk/typist. They would start off a junior wage and gradually progress over time with the organisation. Those days are gone. With modem electronic banking and the way the insurance industry has evolved, technology has taken over. Those kinds of jobs are just not with us any more. Young people who want to get into those industries now need to follow a skills training path that gives them the relevant qualifications that those industries are looking for. All sectors of our educational establishment are now focusing more on skill acquisition than I believe they have ever done in the past. This, of course, includes schools, TAPEs, universities and private providers out in the private marketplace. It is the intention of government to allow them as much flexibility as possible-without imposing draconian bureaucratic control on them-to set their own course structures which meet industry and minimum standards. It is also the intention of the government to allow them. to increase the level of flexible vocational education and training in schools, whether it is apprenticeship programs, whether it is traineeship programs or whether it is simply the schools programs themselves; Whether they are old tech schools or whether they are modem schools dedicated to academic studies, they will gradually take on some aspects of vocational training in their curriculum. They might add business studies or computer studies. They might, for instance, offer some of their young people an introduction to communications or the media. If they are really innovative, they might go back and pick up some of our old crafts and trades. They might pick up carpentry, automotive skills, fitting and turning, horticulture or hospitality skills, which is a growing course in high schools. The focus on skills acquisition has shifted remarkably in the last few years. We have shifted it back into secondary schools. There is no uniformity across the states in this respect. Every state is treating this issue differently and every state is coming up with different bureaucratic mechanisms: I suspect that that is positive. Those who are most successful will have the best outcome in on getting their young people jobs in their state. The other states will then say, 'Hey, what a good example that is to follow. 1'd better do something about changing my system too.' The days are gone when we could have government funded institutions with huge bureaucracies trying on a day-today basis to direct how people are taught and directing their skill acquisition. Those days are gone. One of the aspects of that on which I think this government is doing an excellent joband I note the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is in the House, and I congratulate him on this-is the modem apprenticeship and traineeship system. Essentially, it is all about allowing industry to this help set the pace for training provision. There is no sense in having a 35-page book on the curriculum that is necessary for a structured course in fitting and turning that says, 'This is exactly what you have to learn because somebody learned that 35 years ago.' Today there is a need for a more flexible course where you learn some aspects of mechanics. Perhaps you need to know a bit about carpentry and electrics too in the kind of job you will be going into. So we will introduce into the system some flexibility to allow the industry advisory training boards to more quickly approve new courses, new structures, and allow them to be certified so people can get on with offering advanced and enhanced skills training. At the same time, it will offer young people the opportunity to go to work for an employer and the employer decides, 'I'd like for you to accelerate the course you are doing. I want you to be fully qualified in two years instead of three.' You know we are moving to competency based training and away from time based training, and that is very positive. So the new system would allow the employer, in agreement with his employee, perhaps to have the employee at work three days and at school two days. If he wanted him to do it quickly, the employee could have two days at work and three days at school, and why not? If the young person under that system cannot earn enough to live on, the government will pick up the tab to make sure they have minimum wages, which will allow them a reasonable living standard. Increased flexibility is what this government is all about to offer high quality training to young people and to adults more relevant to industry, business and commerce so we can help promote new jobs, new opportunities and give people the opportunity at satisfying employment.",115
241,Dr KEMP,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation) (6.24 p.m.)-in reply-It gives me a great deal of satisfaction to respond to the contributions that have been made to this debate on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill from both sides of the chamber. There have been a number of very valuable contributions to the debate. Since I have been in the chamber and fortunate enough to hear the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) making his remarks, could I just thank him again for the very broad vision and deep knowledge that he brings to this subject. There are veryÂ· few members of this parliament who have made a bigger contribution to the issues of education and training which affect young Australians. The member for La Trobe has had a long interest in the literacy issue. He has had an equally long interest in the whole area of vocational education and training. He is a distinguished member of this parliament and makes a very significant contribution to its debates in these areas, and certainly we always listen closely to what he has to say. The bilI before the House represents a very firm commitment on behalf of the Commonwealth to maintain a strong vocational education and training sector. We see that this is absolutely essential for Australia, positioned as it is in a highly competitive world with a global economy which is really here now on our shores. Australian businesses are competing in that global economy now on a daily basis. It is critical that Australians be able to bring to the. workplace, to their employment, skills and knowledge which are equal to the best in the world. The government's programs in this area are designed to ensure that young Australians coming into the work force, leaving school, in the work force or who have been out of the work. force for a significant time and who are wishing to re-enter the work force, have access to a training system where the quality of training is world's best. We talk about world's best practice in terms of our industries. We also have to think about world's best practice in terms of our training system. A significant feature of this bill, to which the member for La Trobe drew attention, is the fact that it increases expenditure through the Australian National Training Authority on vocational education and training over the years covered by the bill. It is true that the bill does incorporate some cuts against forward estimates. These reflect the unfortunate fact that when this government came into office it found itself faced with a budget deficit of over $10 billion. Quite clearly, this deficit could not be allowed to continue for the health of the Australian economy, for the well-being of Australian businesses and for the future employment prospects of Australians. It had to be addressed. The savings issue had to be addressed. We did that. We went carefully through every sector of expenditure to ensure that the way in which these savings would be made would be fully consistent with the objectives of the government. In this area, as I say, the objectives are designed to ensure that we continue to build up the quality of our training system and expand the opportunities for Australians, young and old, to participate within this system. Therefore, the vocational education and training expenditure was not quarantined in these discussions and certain efficiency cuts were made to the forward estimates. Despite this, expenditure by the government in this area will grow under this piece of legislation. I draw particular attention to the fact that, for the 1997 year, there will continue to be $70 million of growth funding in the budget: All the growth funding which has been put into the budget for vocational education and training over the last few years is retained in the base for funding this very crucial area of government activity. In the debate the claim was made by the shadow minister. for education and youth affairs, the member for Sydney, that the previous government had made significant progress in this area-and I was pleased to get his broad support for much of what the present government is doing. I am pleased to acknowledge that there were reforms made by the previous government in the training area which we supported and are pleased to build on. I refer particularly to the move to competency based training in industry, which we see as being a key reform to breaking away from the traditional time based character of apprenticeships and traineeships in particular. It certainly help Australian industry to focus its training effort on the specific skills that are required and to deliver these skills in the most efficient and effective way possible. Unfortunately, the systems set in place by the previous government did become exceedingly complex. Many businesses were put off from accessing the training system because of the duplication between the Commonwealth and states, with the need to get approvals at both levels of government; and the complexity of the procedures which had been laid down, including the persistence of old, very outdated procedures such as the declaration of vocations which dates from Victorian England and which, unfortunately, was left in place by the previous government alongside the reforms to the training system which it did put in place. One of the other elements of the previous. government's policies in this area, I believe regrettably, was to link the training system very closely to the industrial relations system. While ,I understand that a political party which represents the trade union movement in this parliament would want to do that, the consequence of doing so was that many small businesses-most of whom, of course, do not have unionised workplaces-perceived the traineeship system as being one which was supervised by the trade union movement. They were unwilling to bring a trainee into the workplace because they feared that to do so would also be to bring a union into the workplace and to subject themselves to pressure for the unionisation of the business. I think it is important we recognise that, if business is to have a sense of ownership of the training system, if the training is to be appropriate, it has to be a system which' is seen by businesses as being accessible to them and one which is divorced from the complexities of the industrial relations arrangements. The provisions that the present government is putting in place, particularly through the workplace relations legislation in the Senate, will ensure that this is so, and under that legislation training arrangements and agreements will be able to be approved by training authorities, not industrial relations will authorities. That will be a very significant step towards breaking the nexus between the industrial relations system and the training system. The consequence of that, we believe, will be that the small and medium sized business sector will be much more willing to enter into some of these training arrangements. The government is, of course, placing a great deal of emphasis on reform of the apprenticeship and traineeship system. Again regrettably, over the last 13 years the apprenticeship system was largely left on the shelf as an out-of-date, time based system confined to traditional trades and subject, as indeed all training arrangements were, to the process of the declaration of vocations which was established over a century ago-and which is really the old, outdated system of training which the new national training arrangements are designed to replace. I am pleased to say that in our discussions with the states we have been able to get some very important agreements within the national training framework to move the system away from its rigidities and out-of-date features, modernise it, bring it up to date and simplify it. One of these has been the agreement of the states to move, from the beginning of 1998, to a system of user choice for off-the-job training associated with apprenticeships. From that time all states have agreed they will have in place arrangements under which the offthe-job training for an apprenticeship can be chosen by the employer and the trainee. They will be able to choose that from the appropriate provider-that is, the provider who they believe will offer them the customised and tailored package of off-the-job training which will best help their business. The public dollar will flow to that provider, whether a publicly funded TAPE college or institute, ora private provider. At the most recent meeting of the state ministers, we were also able to get agreement from every state, except New South Wales, on the abolition of the old process of the declaration of vocations and to put the whole national training system on a completely new and consistent basis within a national framework under the National Training Authority. I regret the fact that New South Wales has not agreed so far to take that step. It has not taken it for perhaps two very siinple reasons. One reason is that the Trades and Labour Council in New South Wales is putting enormous pressure on the minister in that state not to agree to reforms of the Commonwealth government at this time; secondly, the New South Wales Premier, Mr Carr, has apparently issued directions to his ministers that they are not to agree to anything that requires legislation. The stasis that is therefore developing in New South Wales, the freeze on development and modernisation of the system, is of great concern to the business community in that state. I have no doubt at all that the New South Wales government will be hearing, in no uncertain terms, from both national and state business organisations about their attitude, their refusal to move with the rest of Australia towards the further modernisation of the training system. These have been very significant moves taken by the new government. They have been taken because we are determined that young people in Australia will have access to training which leads to real jobs. Perhaps one of the clearest conclusions of the Jobs for Young Australians conference, which occurred in Adelaide in August last year during the time of the previous government, was the very strong resolution out of that conference by the young people there that they were sick and tired of being recycled through shortterm, six-month training programs which did not lead on to jobs but which left them back at the end of the unemployment queue. The evaluation of Working Nation did show that for most of these programs unfortunately a majority of young people did go back onto unemployment queues. We just cannot continue with this situation. They were very expensive programs and they did not work. That is why we are putting in place a whole suite of new arrangements designed to pick up young people before they leave school and. put them on a pathway which will provide them with direct links to employers in the community around the school where they will be offered quality industry endorsed training and quality training over a prolonged period, according to the rapidity with which they move through the competency based framework, which will lead, in the vast majority of cases, to a real job. Part of the reforms, therefore, that are being undertaken out of the expenditure that is dealt with within this legislation is an agreement by the states to use $20 million of the 1997 allocation specifically to encourage the development of vocational education in schools. At the present time, something .like 30 per cent of students in the senior years do not complete year 12. They drop out before the end of year 12. Of those who do complete year 12, some 30 to 40 per cent do not go on to university or full-time TAPE. In other words, only a minority of the students in the senior years of schooling go on in the academic stream. It remains a fact-in some ways an unfortunate fact, although we certainly want to encourage students who have the desire and the capacity to go on through that academic stream-that our schools have been encouraged in recent years to compete with each other according to the TE scores that their students get. What that says is that schools are judged by the number of their students who go on to university. The question arises: what about the other 65 per cent of students? Why don't the schools say, 'Judge us by the number of our students who get jobs and who have gone on to of something worthwhile in other areas'? We would like to see a change in the culture and the attitudes of schooling which will direct increasing attention to the contribution that schools make to the graduate destinations the 65 per cent and not just the 35 cent of students who go on in the academic stream. We regard students presently in that 65 cent as among the more disadvantaged groups in this country. Particularly disadvantaged those students who constitute about half of the 30 per cent who drop out before year who go on to the unemployment queues. Very often they are students who have not picked up in the early years of schooling the vital literacy and numeracy skills. I make no bones about it: this government regards literacy and the acquisition of these basic skills as perhaps the single most serious equity issue facing young people in Australia today. We are determined to address it and to address it in the most effective way and within the shortest time frame that is humanly possible. I am very pleased to say that, with the single exception of the Labor government in New South Wales, every state and territory has agreed to back this agenda and to make it a national cause to deal with these issues and to provide opportunities for young people. The decisions of the government are quite historic in this regard. I believe that they going to have a major impact as they begin take effect on the quality of life in this try because many of the serious social issues that Australian communities now face centre on the young people who have not been able, out of their school years, to gain a secure foothold on a pathway which leads them into a satisfying life after school. It is the building of that pathway-and in some ways the rebuilding of that pathway-which this government has set itself as one of its top priorities. The $20 million that we have earmarked to encourage vocational education in schools will be available for a variety of purposes. We hope-indeed, we expect and will retional quire-that that $20 million will fund industry endorsed training, competency based packages training. It will be used to increase the number and quality of vocational education programs in schools. It will be used to develop closer links between schools and industry, and it will be used to provide students with of an opportunity to start apprenticeships and to 40 per traineeships while at school. This is one of the innovations that the government is putting forward-the school per based apprenticeship; the school based traineeship-enabling students to enter into an are arrangement with a local small to medium sized business to undertake an apprenticeship 12 which involves part-employment for some of the week with the employer and off-the-job education within the school environment. I am delighted that this initiative has been so warmly welcomed by the. secondary school principals of the government schools in Australia. They have written to me and asked if they could participate with the government in a working party on the implementation of this reform. I have responded to them and said that we would be delighted to do this. We want to see cooperation between the schools and the government in this regard. Let me say that the vast majority of schools that will be taking part in this will be within the government school system. I made the point in an earlier debate in this House that I believe this government really are understands what is required to build up to quality within the government school sector. counIt is not going to be done by the kinds of restrictive regulations that the Labor Party wants to put in place, butÂ· will be done by providing real incentives to quality and relevant offerings, and by addressing the issues of literacy, numeracy and vocational education which will meet the needs of the most disadvantaged students in the school systems. I believe that the reforms we have announced will helpthe schools to retain the 30 per cent of students leaving before they complete year 12. The funding provided under this bill will make a substantial contribution to the vocaeducation and training sector. The sector will continue to grow in 1997 and it will continue to play an important role in providing training pathways, particularly for young people, to lead on to real jobs. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Dr Kemp) read a third time. NA AUSTRALIA BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 June, on motion by Mr Anderson: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Dr Lawrence moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House is of the opinion that the bill should withdrawn and redrafted to provide, in the interest of certainty, for $1 billion from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to be credited upon enactment to the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Reserve""  issues taken today among young people of school age would feature the environment very near to, if not at, the top of the list. This is a healthy sign. Thirty or 40 years ago the response would have been quite different, but we live in enlightened times, where we recognise that our actions have consequences. There is a strong feeling throughout the community that it is time to pay the piper. We are all the more conscious of the problems mankind has brought on itself with its misuse and abuse of the earth's natural resources. European settlement has produced a wonderful way of life for so many, but it has wreaked havoc with our natural capital. At long last we have realised it. People still aspire to the same things-jobs, a home and a more comfortable living standard-but we are also aware that these will mean little to oUr descendants if our lifestyles continue to compromise our natural environment. In the past 20 years, environmental groups have proliferated around the globe as the issue has gained prominence. Political parties have been formed and have met with some electoral success, pushing the green agenda further forward. Many environmental problems are dealt with on an international basis, and Australia has been most vocal about other nations cleaning up their communities, their industries and their act. While we have postured on the world stage about greenhouse gases, the ozone layer and acid rain, we have raised the consciousness of our own people here at home. Governments on all levels have inspired the attitude among Australians that protection of our environment begins at home. Littering has been widely discouraged for years and recycling has become a buzzword throughout the communi-:ty. At the same time, federal governments have initiated schemes for the bigger picture. Some have been designed to assuage environmental groups as much as they have been to be cure our environmental problems, but they have been to limited effect. The CEO of the Environmental Management Industry Association of Australia, Dr John Cole, said recently: Money, not good intentions and high sounding rhetoric is what is required to protect and improve our environmental resource. The establishment of the National Heritage Trustthe bill we are debating todaywill be a most significant national initiative which will help stem the rot and offset long standing problems which have been in the too hard basket for too long. Governments of our stripe are not generally renowned for throwing money at problems, but this problem is different. We have a choice between spending massive amounts now or spending even greater sums later when it is all too late. That is an easy decision for us to make. With this legislation we seek to establish the Natural Heritage Trust to ensure that the Australian environment we hand over to our grandchildren compares favourably with that enjoyed by our grandparents. It is a tall order, but it is our duty as legislators to try. A quick scan of the environmental report card reveals the following bad news. There were over five million hectares of native vegetation cleared between 1983 and 1993. Many common native animal species are in decline and some 20 mammal, 20 bird and 68 plant species are presumed extinct. Agricultural and urban development has claimed many of our wetlands. Our major rivers are in trouble and the coast, where 86 per cent of all Australians live, is under massive pressure from agriculture, urban and industrial development, and the exploitation of maritime resources. The picture is bleak and the people have demanded action. It is a measure of this issue that this legislation sets up the biggest, most expensive, most comprehensive environmental package in the nation's history. That it does so is also a measure of this coalition government's commitment to Australia's natural resources and to Australia's future. The decline in the state of our environment is well documented. The pace and the way of life in the 20th century has taken its toll on our vegetation and waterways, our oceans and our coasts. The establishment of a Natural Heritage Trust aims to reverse the decline in each of these vital areas. The trust will motion many different initiatives that together will mean a unified and thorough assault on the environmental problems that affect Australia today. As a South Australian, I am more than happy to see that among the major works to be launched under .the trust will be the Murray-Darling 2001 project. The Murray-Darling Basin is a region vital to all Australians. It encompasses nearly 15 per cent of the nation's area and produces over $10 billion each year. The region is host to a quarter of the nation's cattle and dairy herds and three-quarters of our irrigated land. Its rivers provide the majority of water for my home state of South Australia. My good friend Steele Hall, who until recently served this House as the member for Boothby for 15 years, fought as Premier to get a fair share of the water from the eastern states. He also fought a state election over the location of a site for a dam. That is how important this is in South Australia. The politics of South Australia has long been the politics of water, which is understandable given that we live in the driest state in the Commonwealth. We croweaters hardly need reminding that as far as the Murray and Darling flow we are at the very end of the line and the quantity and quality of the water we get is very much dependent on the conditions upstream. Many communities and industries are built around these rivers and derive enormous benefit from them. But the benefit has come at a price because we have not yet learned to use them properly. As with all natural resources, there are finite limits to a river's bounty. The $165 million in extra resources made available by the trust will be a boon to the long-term future of the Murray-Darling Basin and of significant benefit to future generations of South Australians in particular. The Hawkesbury-Nepean is another river system that will benefit from the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust. As my colleagues from New South Wales would know, the Hawkesbury-Nepean is an area with a large population and is a haven for tourists. It is a vital area for agricultural set in production and provides nearly all of Sydney's drinking water. Yet there are over 90 sewage treatment plants discharging waste into the system's creeks and rivers and large areas have been overcleared. There are other river systems that face similar problems and the national river care initiative will grant an extra $85 million to ensure sustainable management, rehabilitation and conservation. With the help of state and local governments, storm water management, nutrient control and education programs will be set up to rehabilitate our rivers so that communities can continue to derive benefits from them in the long term. Nothing is more evocative of Australian urban life than a day at the beach. We have, for too long, taken for granted the beauty of our summer playgrounds. As a consequence, the shoreline has become a victim of the harsh natural elements and our oceans have been polluted. I noted with interest recently the views of the Surfrider Foundation's Executive Director, Brad Farmer, when he said: You ask any surfer or coastal dweller-we don't give two hoots about selling Telstra or economic rationalism . .. All we know is that we need money for the environment and we don't care how [the government] gets it. He hit the nail right on the head when he said: With the 2000 Olympics on their way, we need to show the world that our coast, our greatest natural asset, is being protected. They're not coming to look at our telephones. Beaches and oceans have long provided Australians with free leisure. We have discovered recently that the coasts can also provide some real economic benefit. Since commercial whaling activities were banned in Australian waters, there has been rapid development of the whole new industry of whale watching. The industry now contributes $9.3 million annually to the economy. This represents a nearly 100 per cent increase in the last three years and has provided an injection of funds for some of the smaller towns that dot our massive coast. Last year, there were about 120 operators of whale and dolphin watching tours and they catered for the amazing number of over 560,000 tourists. It makes sense that the greater the chance of spotting a whale the more clients will avail themselves of a tour. The number of whales in Australian waters has grown rapidly since the commercial ban and we are now deriving economic and pleasurable benefit from the giant mammal without harpooning it. South Australians are given whale sighting updates on television and radio and it is not unusual for crowds to gather at vantage points to catch a glimpse of one of the ocean's marvels. The number of interested tourists is growing still, providing us with a tangible example of how protecting ourÂ· environment has already paid us a dividend. Whale watching is a small but profitable part of a growing eco-tourism market that will see millions come to our shores to view our natural wonders. If we do not take necessary action to repair the damage to our natural capital, many of these wonders will be committed to memory. An Australia without a Barrier Reef, rainforests and viable waterways, bereft of its native and flora and fauna, would surely not become a haven for tourists. In keeping with the promise we made to govern forÂ· all Australians, there will be assistance to reverse the degradation of farm lands. Farmers in this country are forced to do it tough because of the unfortunate regularity of drought. On many occasions, it is only a flood that brings relief. This of course places great strain On farmers to maximise their production when they are able to which, in tum, places pressure on the land. An Industry Commission study has estimated that billions of hectares of Australian agricultural land is degraded and requires treatment. Just how many billions is hard to tell because the research process has been progressive and rather drawn out with some of the data as much as a quarter of a century old. Degradation costs the nation about $1.5 billion each year in lost production. That is about the equivalent of six per cent of agricultural output. If we stand by and do nothing the situation will not right itself; it will only get worse. Though I cannot claim a rural constituency-I note my colleague the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) is present in the chamber and I am sure he will talk on some of these rural issues-like so many Australians I am aware of the great salinity problems caused by the removal of tree cover. Salinity not only condemns arable land but also increases salt in our rivers and poses big problems for the wildlife that rely on the vegetation. To redress the problem of dry land salinity will take a significant financial investment. The government's national vegetation initiative will provide an extra $254 million over five years for revegetation projects. In addition, $64 million over four years, from 1997-98, is designated to assist voluntary schemes to preserve vegetation which might otherwise be cleared. In total, the national vegetation initiative will provide $318 million over five years to combat land and water degradation. The aim is to reverse the trend that has been evident since European settlement. We will attempt to revegetate more than we clear. These are huge undertakings, but Australia is one country, among perhaps a few, capable of achieving its goals. With the support, assistance and encouragement of millions of Australians and the professionalism and know-how of our environmental experts, we can and will get the job done. During the last election campaign, Australians were told repeatedly by the green movement that it was crisis time for the environment. The coalition has realised this for years. That is why we put together this integrated environmental package. In addition, we worked out a way to fund it, and we put that before the Australian people for their approval. It was amazing to watch others jostle for the position of pre-eminent environmental party after the announcement of our dream package. The Greens, who sell themselves as environment first, last and always, and the Democrats, who have no policies other than to look over the government's shoulder to see that we are not cheating, revealed themselves to be, as a noted author P. J. O'Rourke might say, watermelons-green on the outside and pink on the inside. Suddenly the environmental needs of this nation took a back seat to the ideological importance of keeping Telstra entirely in the public domain. To put it bluntly, the Greens and the Democrats have sold out the enthusiastic environmentalists. Worse still, they have put at risk the recovery and the very future of what they claim is dear to their hearts. With regard to the Greens, this whole issue is their . reason for being. But, sadly, interference and obstruction is typical of the minority parties. Neither the Democrats nor the Greens have ever held government in this nation. They have never won a seat in the people's house, and they never will. They promise the world to voters to curry their favour, making outlandish, irresponsible guarantees, knowing full well that they will never have to honour any of them. Their platitudes win them a few seats in upper houses. In the years ahead, those senators, when asked by their grandchildren what they achieved in public life,. will be able to look them in the eye and tell them that they delayed the greatest environmental deal in Australian history. The small collection of holier-than-thou oddities in the other place is holding this nation to ransom. The coalition received a massive mandate on 2 March. The size of our majority is ample proof of that. The election result should have been a message to the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens that their time was up. But, sadly, they have' learnt nothing. Those minorities in the other place maintain that this package can be funded without the partial sale of Telstra. I remind them that the coalition government has inherited a foreign debt of $180 billion from Labor. After the election we discovered-I am sure you are tired of hearing it-a $10.4 biIIion black hole. It will not go away.",119
242,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"You believe any myth. Why don't you go and do some economic research?  plan-options that the Labor and minor parties want to foist on the Australian people""-are to increase taxes or add even more to our overseas borrowing, despite its contribution to the current account deficit and its impact on higher interest rates, business confidence, investment and employment. We have news for them- ,",126
243,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"You haven't said anything new so far. All you've said so far is just mythology.  Calwell at the table. Something will eventually give, and it is not going to be our campaign pledges to the Australian people. I note with interest the initiative of the Labor government in New South Wales. They should be congratulated on their new $30 million heritage fund, which is designed to restore and conserve their state's heritage. The Carr government has acted responsibly on this one, which, to say the least, is highly unusual for a Labor government. They will fund the program from the sale of assets-ironicallyincluding the State Office Block.",126
244,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"What is the state government of South Australia doing? What has South Australia done? Nothing.  provide long-term management of heritage items of significance in New South Wales. I suggest that those opposite take note of Premier Carr's pragmatism in considering their stance onÂ· the partial sale of Telstra. In fact, you might want to cross the floor, Andrew. The blind addiction to the dogma of public ownership does not extend to New South Wales, it seems. I suspect that, if those few opposite in this place who are democratically elected were still on this side. of the House, including the member for Calwell, they would be behind the Telstra partial sale. In fact, they probably would be selling the whole lot of Telstra. The establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust will provide the mechanism for funding the government's environment commitments. These commitments are significant and will deliver the goods. We will be providing $318 million for the national vegetation initiative, $32 million for the national land and water resource audit, $163 million for the Murray-Darling 2001 project, $85 million for the national river care initiative, and $100 million for the coast and clean seas initiative. No other government has promised such a program, let alone delivered on it. This coalition government is different. We will get the job done, despite the hypocrisy of the other place. The Surfrider Foundation's Brad Farmer, in the Weekend Australian, said: For 18 years, they [the Democrats] have been asking exactly, virtually to a T, what the Government is offering, and to decline it on grounds is less than honest. Mr Farmer, for those who are not aware, is a former adviser to Senator Cheryl Kernot. For the sake of our environment and our future generations, I wish she was still listening to him. John F. Kennedy gave a speech to the University of California at Berkeley in 1962 about world peace and how the clamour of daily events tends to interfere with our view of the great movements of history. To illustrate his point, he told the story of the French marshal who once asked his gardener to plant a tree. The gardener complained, telling him that the tree was slow to grow and would take a century to reach full maturity. 'In that case,' the marshal said, 'there is no time to lose. Plant it this afternoon.' President Kennedy concluded his speech with words that are perhaps even more appropriate to this issue than to his: 'We have no time to lose, let us plant our trees this afternoon.'",127
245,Mr JENKINS,NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST OF,"The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill seeks to establish the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, into which it is proposed that part of the proceeds of the sale of one-third of Telstra will be paid. It is intended that these proceeds will fund very important environmental projects, such as the national vegetation initiative, the national land and water resource audit, the Murray-Darling project, the national river care initiative, the coasts and clean seas initiative, and the national reserve system for biodiversity. These are essential programs, necessary for the protection and repair of Australia's natural environment. They are initiatives that were committed to by the previous Labor government. They were committed to as part of the normal budgetary processes of government, as any area of government activity should be, and were not made contingent upon the sale of Telstra. This makes a mockery of the government's claim that the trust projects are somehow innovative or even their own idea. The conserving natural Australia package announced by the previous Labor government committed $173 million for the protection of Liberal biodiversity in Australia, including $80 these million over four years for the national reserve system. This is the same $80 million that the government would have one believe is some innovative idea to be funded from the trust. Biodiversity must be protected because healthy ecosystems allow for the maintenance .of factors such as the quality of the atmosphere, the climate, fresh water and the waste cycle. Under the previous governrrient's sustaining rural Australia policy an extra $176- million had been earmarked for the landcare program. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you well know, landcare is about getting local involvement in the repair of degradation and taking measures to have the individual land users bear responsibility for utilise the land. The main challenge is to educate land users that they must adopt practices which ensure that the land is treated as a sustainable resource. The success of landcare demonstrates that funded groups 'at the coalface' are often best placed to tackle these major problems. The government has allocated $8 million to landcare in the budget. The rest of the funding is conditional on Telstra's sale. Full landcare funding must come unconditionally from consolidated revenue and not rely on the sale of Telstra. As a core function of government, landcare funding should come from the budget. The Labor government's sustaining rural Australia policy provided $98 million for the Murray-Darling Basin initiative. The various levels of government of the federation had already spent $300 million on this protect. The initiative covers 1.6 million square kilometres, one-seventh of the area of the continent. It is the largest integrated ment program of its kind. The aims of the Murray-Darling Basin initiative are the promotion and coordination of planning and management to make sure that the land and water resources of the basin can be used sustainably. It is another core project and it should continue to be funded as part of the normal budget process, not have its future made contingent on the sale of Telstra. The Murray-Darling Basin project has seen the cooperation of the states and the Commonwealth and those people who live within the basin. It is truly an example of way in which, even given the complications that our federal system throws in our paths, we are able to achieve something that is very important. Of course, the Murray-Darling Basin is unique. The Australia: state of the environment report indicates that in less than one day the Amazon carries the Murray's annual flow. As you would be weIl aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the system along the riverbeds is in the main a series of unconnected lagoons. It has had all sorts of problems. It has led to problems of salinity of the basin and on some occasions has led to blue-green algae outbreaks. A report in today's Melthe way that they bourne Age said: Environmental degradation of the Murray-Darling basin, farming practices and regulation of water flows had disturbed the breeding patterns of many of the 29 species of native fish found in the area This was according to a spokesman from the Australian Conservation Foundation, Mr Tim Fisher. The fish at risk within the Murray-Darling Basin system include the trout cod, an endangered species, the Macquarie perch, a vulnerable species, the Agassiz's chanda perch, an endangered species, the Murray cod, a vulnerable species, golden perch, a rare species, silver perch, a species in decline, and the Murray hardyhead, being considered for vulnerable species listing. As the report in today's Age indicates, about 80 per cent of the Murray's natural flow was extracted from the river and 95 per cent of that was used for irrigation. This is a mammoth task. It is a task worth doing. Because it is a task worth doing, catch- it should be funded from the budget. The national water audit, proposed to be funded by the Natural Heritage Trust, was part of the previous government's national river health program. The State of the environment report, a comprehensive audit of Australia's environmental problems, says that Australia lacks basic data on the quality of our water and the characteristics of catchment. As a side comment, it is my experience, being a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts, that one of the the recurring problems that we find, no matter what the environmental question we are discussing, is that there is a lack of baseline data. The national water audit would go to collating figures that are required on a national basis. The development of a national methodology is important to ascertain the state of our rivers and deserves to be funded without the Telstra sale. These worthy projects would have been funded as part of the normal budgetary process of government by a Labor government. This exposes the sham of this government's attempts to create some kind of link between the environment and the sale of Telstra. Under Labor the projects were committed and would have been funded and Telstra was to remain in full public ownership. The difference between the government and the opposition on these issues is in the strength of the commitment to the environment. The opposition believes that the environment .is of sufficient importance to be funded in its own right, unconditionally from the normal budget cycle. The government believes that the environment is only important enough to justify selling Telstra for, but if that cannot be done, it is not important enough to do anything about. This has led the chairperson of the Biodiversity Advisory Council, Professor Roger Kitching, on Lateline on 1 August to describe the so-called Telstra link as being of a ridiculous nature. In the same program the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) responded by saying that the professor had a valid argument. If the minister feels that way, why insist upon the link? The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) claimed in his second reading speech that this bill 'demonstrates this government's commitment to ensuring a cleaner, greener and more sustainably productive Australia'. It is so committed that if the parliament decides not to pass the Telstra legislation, this trust will contain nothing and these so-called innovative projects will go unfunded. Should the sale of Telstra not proceed, there is no commitment to any of these worthwhile programs. It is ironic that the government now parades itself as some kind of environmental guardian, given the coalition's woeful track record on major environmental issues in the past and its lack of commitment to the environment in the budget. The list of steps undertaken by the previous Labor government that were opposed by the coalition is seemingly endless. Logging in the wet tropics would never have stopped; the Franklin would have been flooded; and mining at Kakadu would have been allowed to proceed, as it seems it might yet. Is the vastly reduced environment program of the department to be the only environmental expenditure if the Natural Heritage Trust is not established? One might ask, Mr Deputy Speaker. The level of expenditure on the environment that we can expect from the trust is a matter of grave concern. In his second reading speech the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy spoke of an initial capital of $1 billion. However, there is no commitment in this bill for a replenishment of the trust once the nearly $700 million proposedÂ· in these measures has been exhausted. Only $300 million is to remain in the trust and, presumably, the interest from this money would finance additional environmental schemes. Is this to be the only expenditure on the environment? Are environmental initiatives ever again going to be funded from the budget? If not, the interest on the remaining $300 million in the trust would be sadly inadequate to provide for all the environmental programs necessary for Australia. This bill also raises serious questions about the government's philosophy in committing funds to important national responsibilities. It is inevitable, given its pathological obsession with privatisation for privatisation's sake, that the government will attempt at some stage in the future to divest itself of its remaining shares in Telstra. Indeed, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) has already confirmed this. When the government tries to do so, will it also try to link that sale with some other government outlay? Will the government try to link that sale with the Commonwealth's obligations to, say, the health system, or to aged care or transport provisions? This attempt to generate a link between the sale of Telstra and the funding of a series of government programs establishes a dangerous precedent. Will the day come when the parliament is blackmailed into supporting privatisation to provide for people's social security benefits? Where will it end? Even while the government is attempting to dream up environmental credentials for itself, the budget tells a different story. Environmental organisations such as the Australian Conservation Foundation have expressed their reservations about the trust simply replacing the money already cut from environmental programs. As Michael Krockenberger from the ACF said: The billion dollars of course has to be funded in own right. It can't simply be a case of replacing other cuts. Yet with the inclusion of projects that had already been committed, combined with the cuts to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, this is precisely what it amounts to. In the Latelineinterview I referred to earlier, Professor Kitching says he is concerned that, because of the trust, the usual recurrent funding will just 'drift away in future years'. The Minister for the Environment responded: That would be wrong and that won't occur. But the budget papers seem to indicate otherwise. The funding drift appears. to be occurring anyway, whether the trust is established or not. The total environment program within the environment, sport and territories portfolio has suffered a dramatic cut from $212.3 million spent in the last financial year to $96.2 million in four years time, in the year 1999-2000. This represents a massive cut of some $116 million over four years in the annual expenditure. But if we go to a table which is appendix 2 on page 35 of the document entitled Investing our natural heritage: a statement by Senator the Honourable Robert Hill, Minister for the Environment, released on budget night, we can look at the decline in funding over the next four years. The decline in funding in the environment portfolio alone in those four years, including this financial year as the first year, is some $268.9 million. That is not even looking at the decline in the funding that we would find in the primary industries portfolio which would cover such things as the Murray-Darling Basin expenditure, landcare expenditure and other expenditures. If we match that large amount of money against the amount of money proposed to be spent out of the trust fund, we start to see that, as Professor Kitching says, funding will just drift away in future years. Among the cuts in the budget are the $5 million cut to the Australian Heritage Commission, mainly because of the discontinuation of the state and territory component of the national estate grants program. This small component of the NEGP allowed people to its work locally on projectsÂ· of state and territory significance to protect and conserve the environment. None of the projects included for funding under this program are included in those to be funded by the Natural Heritage Trust. So the government cannot even claim that the trust measures will replace this program. The Australian Nature Conservation Agency has been slashed by $36.1 million over the next four years. This agency declares and manages parks and reserves on Commonwealth owned or leased land and in Commonwealth waters. It controls and regulates trade in Australian native flora and fauna and has responsibilities under the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992. It has been savaged by this government's budget cuts. So, while the government trots out the line that the Natural Heritage Trust is the greatest environmental undertaking ever, it shows its true colours by seeking to implement severe cuts to the environment programs of the department. These cuts demonstrate that little has changed in the coalition's attitude to the environment over the years. Each of the projects covered by the trust are worthwhile-I do not think that in the course of this debate there has been any argument about that-and they deserve to be funded in their own right, not made dependent on the sale of Telstra. They are core initiatives that require to be funded off the core budget. One of the real concerns about the way in which environmental funding has been treated in the budget is that the promised additional $84 million for the environment in this financial year 1996-97 was to be seen as a transitional arrangement before the take-up of the proposed trust. Not even that was fulfilled in the budget. So we have this contradiction that, because the government believes that the Journed. Natural Heritage Trust is in doubt because of actions of the Senate, it will not even put forward the full $84 million that it promised. If we go to Budget Paper No. 1 and look at 'Environment protection' on page 3-125, we see a footnote against a number of the items for funding for the year 1996-97. Footnote (e) says: Funding to maintain core environmental mes and undertake planning pending partial Te1stra. So included in this year's funding are amounts of money that will not be renewed later down the track. Even if we go then to the functions in the agriculture, forestry and fishing outlays section on page 3-142, have footnote (c): Funding to maintain core environmental programmes and undertake planning pending partial Telstra. Those programs include the national feral excellent animal control strategy, the national weed strategy, funding for the national landcare projects, the Murray-Darling 2001 project additional funding to improve natural repeople, sources management. As I have said, these programs each of which stands in its own of right and should be funded. They should be funded now. The whole question of environit mental funding, as some commentators have said, should not be put into some sort of holding pattern, as if problems of getting Senate to agree with measures has first arthree rived this year under this government. It has been a recurring problem over many years and was a recurring problem for previous government. This government should have taken it into account. It should not used as an excuse for not providing in this financial year sufficient funding for environnational mental protection to be able to continue programs that have been commenced and that are worthwhile. Environmental funding even in this year, before it was intended to have the trust take up the funding, should not be held to ransom. I support the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr rence). . Debate (on motion by Mr Anthony) adNA Motion (by Mr Jull) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Aircraft Services",127
246,Mr OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT,"The programHoward government's recent closure of sale of ASTAAS and the destruction of 450 highly skilled jobs constitutes a callous and stupid action that will inhibit the growth of the Geelong regional economy. It indicates that this government has no clear industry policy, no regional development strategy nor any real we concern about the employment consequences of its policies. As I indicated to the House on 11 Septemsale of ber 1996, ASTAAS was a company that possessed a highly skilled work force and an national and international reputation. Over eight years, it had grown to occupy a unique position in Victoria and Australia's and aerospace industry. Employing over 450 the company was a significant enterare prise to the Geelong economy from the point view of the direct wages that it poured into the local economy and the goods and services bought from Geelong businesses. When the government called for expressions of interest for the purchase of ASTAAS and the Avalon airport, to my knowledge there were potential bidders who responded to the government: Skilled Engineering, which expressed an interest in the purchase of the ASTAAS; a consortium sponsored by the Habitat Trust, which included road and air be freight as well as production interests and which intended to develop Avalon as a major economic gateway and air freight hub; and Foxerco, a joint venture which the government has decided is its preferred bidder protection for Avalon airport. There are significant questions relating to the demise of ASTAAS and the sale of Avalon airport which the Geelong community demand be answered by this government. LawWhy did the government not pursue the Skilled Engineering expression of interest as it was the only bid based on the preservation of the 450 jobs at ASTAAS? One would have thought that any government interested in manufacturing industry, employment and regional development would have pursued this bid to exhaustion. Why did the government not pursue the Habitat sponsored bid that offered an employment generating development on a massive scale, that would have provided the critical mass of air freight activity and that could have provided ongoing work for the skills of the ASTAAS work force? What guarantees has the government negotiated with the preferred bidder for Avalon airport to preserve the integrity of the facility and to develop its unique potential in the economic interests of the region and the nation? What is the full extent of the taxpayers' interest in Avalon? What return can the taxpayers expect from its sale? And to what extent has the eventual sale value of this public asset been affected by the closure of ASTAAS and the termination of rental income from the company to Avalon Airport Ltd? I outlined to the House in my 11 September speech the vision that I and the Geelong community had and still have for Avalon airport. Those plans centre around the development of the airport as an international economic gateway and an airfreight hub of national and international significance exporting perishable food and floriculture products drawn from a four-state hinterland, which includes Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Riverina region of New South Wales. The job opportunities in this type of development are enormous and offer the Geelong region a real chance to break the long cycle of unemployment that has accompanied the restructuring of manufacturing industry over the past 15 years. This is an opportunity that our community cannot afford to let pass by. It is an opportunity that the nation must develop if it wants to secure our future as a major exporter of perishable foods to the Asian region. The destruction of ASTAAS and the loss of 450 highly skilled jobs is a stupid act aided and abetted by a negligent and ineffectual Liberal state government. There are several things that the federal government must do immediately to secure Avalon's economic future. It must secure from the potential buyer of Avalon a commitment to preserve the integrity of the airport and its environs, and to develop the facility as a dedicated airfreight hub and economic gateway. The government should also close Essendon airport and allow the transference of jet cargo activity to Avalon. Under its supermarkets to Asia strategy, it should immediately fund further studies on the market potential for products grown in Avalon's four-state hinterland and fund further feasibility studies for infrastructure linkages between the road, port, rail, and airport assets that are juxtaposed in the environs of Avalon. It must move immediately in conjunction with the Victorian government to encourage potential users of the airport-be they aviation manufacturing operations, aircraft maintenance and refurbishing operations, or airfreight operators and distributors-to stimulate employment growth in the region. Lindsay By-election",131
247,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (7.32 p.m.)-Jack Lang and Huey Long are alive and well and running the ALP's campaign in the seat of Lindsay. I would like to quote the former Prime Minister, who said that push polling was 'one of the grubbiest, most sinister techniques ever employed in the electoral history of this country'. He said that push polling was 'grievous and putrid tactics'. He said that push polling was 'the worse feature of the American electoral system'. Notwithstanding that, push polling has been introduced into the Lindsay by-election by the Australian Labor Party. I would like to quote the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), who described push polling as 'the most heinous of shenanigans'. Again under his leadership it has been introduced into the by-election for the seat of Lindsay by the Labor Party. Push polling is a technique whereby questions designed to smear a candidate are asked in the guise of polling. Typically, these questions are asked within a election for maximum impact and minimum backlash. In the last 48 hours, thousands of calls have been made to people in Lindsay who were push polled on issues that affected them. The conversations went like a rolling script: 'Hello, I am calling from Ross Free's office. Did you know that, if the Liberals are elected on Saturday ... ' If talking to a mother, person would be told that child-care facilities will be savagely reduced. If talking person, the voter was told pensions will be cut. If talking to a student, the person would be told university funding will be cut. If talking to a public housing tenant, the voter would be told rent will go up. Hundreds of people have been ringing Jackie Kelly's campaign office to complain about this appalling tactic. I have in my possession a statutory declaration from a lady living in Kennedy Drive in Penrith. She says: On Wednesday 16th October 1996 I was contacted by phone at my private address by a man identified himself as a representative he made negative comments and statements which I felt were a fear campaign against government policies. I felt that these statements were being made to induce me to vote Labor in the by-election this Saturday. I resent these tactics and the use of my private telephone for this purpose. She is one of thousands of people who are being subjected to the big lie technique, which was first developed in Germany in the 1930s and is now being employed by the them. Australian Labor Party. I do not often quote the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, but let me quote what he said in this House: I do not believe in push-polling. I think it Australian. I am sorry my party did it. I apologise for them. We will have no more of it. He said it in a different context and to differcerning ent people, but it is very good advice. The in in Weston. Leader of the Opposition should heed it. In question time today the Treasurer Costello) described Ross Free, the Labor Party candidate, as the Keating candidate this coming by-election. I think that was very unfair. It was unfair to Paul Keating because Ross Free is worse than Paul Keating because ,the former Prime Minister would simply not day or two. of the stoop so low. What we are seeing in the Lindsay by-election are desperate measures by a desperate party-a party of sour grapes, sore losers and bad sports. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to repudiate these tactics now. If he has any shred of decency and if he has any ounce of leadership in his body, he must repudiate these tactics now. It is urgent that he do it the before his minions next call out Tom Domican to go around and start talking to the to an old voters of Lindsay. Weston Post Office",132
248,Mr FITZGIBBON,ADJOURNMENT,"Hunter) (7.36 p.m.)On a number of occasions in this place I have made mention of what is known as dynamic decline and its impact on towns in rural and regional Australia. Dynamic decline is usually triggered by the withdrawal of a major employer in a town. As a result, jobs are lost, household incomes fall and the local economy becomes depressed. Local businesses lose who revenue and become no longer viable and for Ross Free, more jobs are lost. The young and those who can afford to leave the town in search of greener pastures do so. Older Australians with no desire to move and those without the necessary finances to move remain. The banks desert their customers who have been loyal to them for years. Governments begin to claim that the critical mass no longer exists in the township to support vital services and they withdraw This process is repeating itself all over Australia. It is happening in towns in my electorate. One interesting case study is the is untown of Weston in my electorate. I am reluctant to talk down the future prospects of one of my towns, but there are some very consigns that dynamic decline is setting Tariff reform has decimated the local textile (Mr industry, and the coal mining industry has effectively moved on. Two years ago the for town's only bank, the Commonwealth Bank, closed its door. Despite pleas from the local community, no reconsideration was given. Thankfully, the local post office moved to fill the void and offered banking services to Weston's 5,000 residents-a high percentage of them pensioners. A couple of months ago I was contacted by the Area Manager of Australia Post. He informed me that Australia Post was undertaking a review of the Weston post office, with a view to downgrading it to a licensed post office. As a result, I met with a number of community leaders and, after discussion, we reluctantly accepted the inevitability of the downgrade. We were relieved that at least the Weston CBD's most prominent building would not be vacated. We were confident that the transition from a corporate post office to a licensed post office could be achieved without any loss of the standard that Australia Post customers had learned to enjoy from the Weston office's loyal and dedicated staff. Indeed, you could say we showed some faith and we accepted the move. On Friday of last week, I received another letter from the Area Manager of Australia had to say. Post informing me that, from 29 November this year, members of the Weston community will be able to access the services offered by Australia Post at the local video store. Where will Weston pensioners access their pension accounts? At the local video store. I want to make it clear that I am not tioning the ability of the operator outlet to offer a good service-as good a service as is possible in the circumstances. I am certainly not questioning his sincerity and his desire to offer the people of Weston a good service. I have spoken with Mr Tonks. Obviously he is a smart business person and has a high degree of integrity. I thank Mr Tonks for moving to ensure that Weston is not faced with the prospect of not having a post office at all. I know that all honourable members in this place will agree that you cannot provide the standard of service traditionally enjoyed by Australia Post customers at the local video outlet. It is wrong-I am sure they will also agree-to force the aged in our communities to access their bank accounts at the local video outlet. On Monday of this week I wrote to the minister asking him to block the move. I now implore him to do so. This move by Australia Post is a disgrace and, potentially, it will kill the Weston central business district. Let me tell the House why Australia Post are increasingly coming under pressure to cut costs, despite their record profits and their productivity gains in recent years. It is basically because they know that, not too far down the track, they will be opened up to further competition, particularly in the area of the standard letter service. They now have to gear up to withstand the loss of profits they will incur as a result of that. I say that governments of all political persuasions need to wake up to what is happening in rural and regional- . Mr MCArthur-Read the report.",133
249,Mr FITZGIBBON,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, I have read the report, and I have to say that I do not have a lot of faith. I have read the Industry Commission's report, too, and what they have . Governments need to show a greater interest in regional and rural Australia and not withdraw from regional policy, which has been the case with this government. Governments of both political persuasions need to realise that matters are not all economic and questhat there are times when we need to put of the video people first. Lindsay By-election Islington Railway Yards",134
250,Ms WORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"Adelaide) (7.41 p.m.)Before the last federal election, a leaked union campaign document warned of the campaign of fear and loathing that Labor would wage against us in the lead-up to the March election. We have heard more of that today as the people of Lindsay are being forced back to the ballot boxes next Saturday complete with how-to-vote cards-proof of the cosy deal that Labor has done with Australians Against Further Immigration. Perhaps none of this is surprising, because Gary Gray was recently observed on a flight between Melbourne and Canberra, and he was unable to take his eyes off a book entitled Guerilla Advertising. At question time today, the tacticsÂ· in Lindsay were shown up for what they areSouth taking the people of Lindsay for granted and lying through their teeth at the same time. They showed absolute reckless disregard the truth, with wild claims of Medicare AN offices closing when the one office there will not close. Visits to the doctor are supposedly up $2, but there was no such decision taken in the budget. Perhaps the cruelest evidence unethical. of fear and loathing is the claim that the residents of Penrith in public housing would have to pay five times more than they are paying now. But it is not just the residents of Lindsay who are being subjected to such reckless disregard for the truth-so too are the resiSmith dents in my electorate of Adelaide. The Labor candidate for the state seat of Unley is fully making claims that entry fees to nursing homes would be as high as $88,000. This never part of the budget. It is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition South Australia for whom I reserve my most severe criticism. He has mailed out in his electorate a letter asking people to become members of the Labor Party. At the same time, he is indulging in a campaign of and loathing so evident in the Lindsay camHe paign and so evident all over Australia prior to the March general election. He has managed to mention my name three times in letter to the electorate. Under the heading 'Liberals betray Kilburn over AN clean-up', he claims that the Liberals have broken promises. This man has got down in the gutter in an attempt to raise his profile in that part of electorate of Adelaide which he represents the state parliament. There have been no broken promises and no betrayal of the people who live and work in Kilburn. This is where some history is important. Before and following the handover of the railways from the state of South Australia the Commonwealth, 200,000 tonnes of toxic waste-including asbestos, solid cyanides, acids, leads and arsenic-were dumped at the Islington rail yards. It has been described as for Lindsay. the most badly contaminated land in South Australia, and it is close to residential homes. The dumping practice continued after the Australian Waste Management Act of 1979 was passed, outlawing such practices. A senior officer of the South Australian Envifor ronmentProtection Authority wrote: has benefited in the past from disposal practices which, if they had been carried out by the private sector, would have led to prosecution, at best their approach has been irresponsible and The then Labor minister took no regard of this. Before the 1993 election, the then minister for transport, Senator Collins, promised to do something but did not. After I pursued this issue in this place, the then minister, the member for Kingsford(Mr Brereton), had the CSIRO investigate the problem. Only three days before the shameelection was announced, the government offered $5 million for the clean-up, with the was state government having to reimburse the Commonwealth with a profit made from the in sale of land. The land at that time was valued between $2.5 million and $3.8 million. Labor by then, of course, was on the way out and did not have to keep any of its commitments. Mr Ralph Clarke was elected as the state fear member for Ross Smith in December 1993. did nothing to get his federal colleague and the then Labor federal government to act. My own efforts in the campaign to have the a land clean-up are wellÂ·documented-not only of on the parliamentary record but also in the press and electorate newsletters. When the first Howard budget was handed down on 20 August, there in the budget papers was the line: $2 million for the clean-up of the Islingthe ton rail yards. That is the same net amount as in the terms so belatedly offered by Labor. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is a man of his word. He has undertaken in this House to ensure thatÂ· the clean-up will go ahead. The member for Ross Smith is down in the gutter, to as his track record shows. He disregards the truth and alarms people. He is shamefully just trying to promote his own name as Ross Free is doing this very day as the Labor candidate Environment",134
251,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"Scullin) (7.46 p.m.)Tonight I want to do something that the government seems bashful about doing, that is, promote this book, entitled Australia: state of the environment. On 26 September in the Sydney Morning Herald James Woodford said in describing it: It is one of the most spectacular books that has ever been produced by any government in Australia and one of the most valuable encyclopedic analyses of our nation. The State of the environment report is a complete audit of the vast variety of environmental problems facing Australia and details appropriate action that needs to be taken. It is an independent report commissioned by the previous Labor government and conducted by the State of the Environment Advisory Council chaired by Professor Ian Lowe of Griffith University. The report was presented to the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) in May and an executive summary was released. The government released the report on 27 June 1996 and it was launched here in Parliament House on 25 September 1996. If one goes through the contents of this report one will see how extensive the report is. It has chapter headings such as: human settlement; biodiversity; the atmosphere; land resources; inland waters,estuaries and the sea; and natural and cultural heritage. It is allencompassing and includes a wide range of subjects that one could identify as being classified as part of the environment. The report shows quite clearly that urgent action is required on a range of fronts to repair damage already done to Australia's natural environment and to prevent other problems from developing. The results of the report are not good for the government's attempts to link the environment to the sale of Telstra. In the article in the Sydney Morning Herald to which I have already referred, James Woodford wrote: But the report's implicit message is that Australia's environment cannot wait for the highly unpredictable success of the sale of a telecommunications utility. Unfortunately, there are signs that the government is equivocal in its commitment to the report. A member of the State of the Environment Biodiversity Advisory Committee claimed that there should have been a much more major launch for the document and said that its public profile should be much higher. I understand that the government is not planning to undertake a formal response to the report. IÂ· sincerely hope that the government is committed to the report and its recommendations and that it is prepared to see the report distributed far more widely. This report indicates in its overall message: Our actions have been most effective where they have taken a comprehensive and systematic approach integrating different aspects of the overall problem. By contrast, failure tends to be piecemeal efforts that treats symptoms rather than the underlying causes. It goes on to say: Progress towards ecological sustainability requires recognition that human society is part of the ecological system and integration of ecological thinking into all social and economic planning. I think that this report goes a long way to achieving that. It is something that the wider community should be made aware of and be assisted to have access to. r understand that 10,000 executive summaries of the document have been distributed and that the first run of the book was 7,000 copies. I believe that the executive summary is something that should most definitely be even more widely disseminated. It should form important discussions even at local community level about the way that we can tackle our environmental problems. One thing is clear: the state of the environment is a question for the national government. But, because of the way in which our federation is put together, it will require not only action by the national parliament and the national government but also the cooperation of the states and territories, local government and, indeed, local communities. I hope that the government does endeavour to promote what this book is about in a greater way. I hope that the government encourages wider discussion of the matters that are raised in the report and that it ensures, in raising these matters, that we look at solutions in a sensible way that will ensure there is cooperation in all spheres of government and in all aspects of the community. At $49.95 this is really a good buy. Superannuation: Mr Ronald Poole",136
252,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening in the adjournment debate I would like to bring to the attention of the House some concerns of a constituent of mine who has been corresponding with me for quite some time over an issue that concerns him greatly. Mr Ronald Poole of Port Macquarie is a superannuant receiving superannuation payments from Com super. His grievance is that his superannuation is called a pension. indicates to me that he does not agree with this description and takes umbrage.at the fact that the Commonwealth calls his superannuation a pension.

253,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,"Grayndler) (7.54 p.m.)I rise tonight to put on the record my congratulations to two winners of this year's Nobel Peace Prize-the Bishop of Dili, Carlos Belo, and the Sydney-based academic, Mr Jose Ramos Horta. Both of them have fought relentlessly for the human rights of the East Timorese. Bishop Belo returned to East Timor in July 1981 after being ordained to priesthood in Lisbon, Portugal, the year before. He has issued a number of statements and pastoral letters on the situation in East Timor calling for changes in the treatment of the East Timorese population by the Indonesian auth. orities. He has also given refuge to youths being hunted for their alleged role in protest demonstrations in favour of democracy and self-determination. Bishop Belo has been described in the media as a man who can 'pack a political punch' and who has a well-deserved reputation for courage and stating the truth. Because of the stance, and the risks, he has taken in defending his people, he has come under increasing pressure from the Indonesian authorities. I note from a recent front page report in the Australian newspaper that President Suharto would not even offer his congratulations to Bishop Belo when they met in Dili during a presidential visit this week. Jose Ramos Horta is currently in exile in Australia, working as a lecturer in the law faculty at the University of New South Wales. He was East Timor's Minister for External Relations and Information before the bloody invasion by Indonesian troops in 1975. Mr Ramos Horta heads the national council of East Timorese resistance and is a permanent representative to the United Nations' for the East Timorese independence movement. I note that he has stated he wishes he could share the award with the Fretilin leader, Xanana Gusmao, who is currently being detained by the Indonesian forces. Since the invasion, Jose Ramos Horta has continued to work tirelessly for independence out of Portugal, then the United Nations and now Australia. The awarding of these two Nobel peace prizes is a strong and stirring political symbol of which we in positions of political influence in Australia should take note. It is highly encouraging that such an important international statement has been made on behalf of the people of East Timor and their fight against the Indonesian authorities. While the public hears little of what is happening in East Timor, we cannot tum a blind eye to the massacres and bloodshed that have occurred to the East Timorese at the hands of the Indonesian authorities since 1975. Mr Ramos Horta has said that Australia must be part of a concerted international effort to persuade Indonesia to withdraw troops from East Timor. It is significant that the United Nations and, indeed, most countries do not recognise the takeover. I urge the members oUhis House to consider the plight of the East Timorese and to assist these two Nobel Peace Prize winners in achieving their dream of independence and the halting of violence against their people. This is an important human rights issue and history will certainly judge our role in its development. It is significant that Australia has a particular responsibility, given the role that Fretilin and the East Timorese had during Wodd War II in protecting Australian troops after the Japanese invasion of Timor. The Timorese suffered many thousands of casualties while defending and protecting Australian troops in Timor. Unfortunately, Australia's record in repaying that debt to the East Timorese leaves much to be desired. I pass on my congratulations not only to the two individuals but also to the East Timorese people as I believe the Nobel Peace Prize award is not so much a recognition of those two individuals. Whilst that is important, it is also a recognition of the struggle of an entire people, and I think the Nobel recipients would agree. They are an entire people who have much in common with Australia being a Christian nation to the north of us. They have much in common with many Australians and J think this is an important recognition, one which the House should not let pass without some recognition of it. That is the reason for my raising this matter here tonight. ",137
254,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Friday, I visited Perry Matthews and his wife. Perry Matthews and his wife have a young family. Perry, unfortunately, was diagnosed on 21 May 1996 with terminal cancer. He had previously taken out a policy with the AMP in September 1995, but the AMP declined to come good on the policy on . the basis that he had not disclosed the fact that he had had a melanoma removed 2Y2 years before. That melanoma has no connection whatsoever medically with the lung cancer. In the short time available, I have looked at the material in relation to this case. Certainly, there is a potential legal matter pending but, in my opinion, having regard to the statements made by the agent at the time, AMP should reconsider this matter in the light of all the evidence. It should consider the Matthews family as a worthy one to make some sort of ex gratia payment to them having regard to all the circumstances of this particular case, in particular the fact that Mr Matthews and his family are going to be left destitute as a result of the decision of AMP to decline on their policy. In these circumstances, I call on AMP to look at the matter again with a view to assisting this sad family's situation. House adjourned at 8 p.m. The following notices were given: Mr Williams to move: (1) That: (a) the amendments to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 which are contained in the exposure draft presented to the House this day be referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund for consideration and an advisory report to the House in conjunction with the Committee's consideration and reporting on the matter referred to the Committee on 27 June 1996; (b) the time for the advisory report by the Committee to the House be extended from 1 November 1996 to 18 November 1996' and (c) the t-rms o.f this res.olution, so far as they are .

I acknowledge Nolan, who was the convenor, coordinator and I want to acknowledge and place on the record Wednesday, 16 October 1996 supports these bills because they will improve the community have to deal with, hopefully leading compliance costs. It is also worth remembering law improvement process that was initiated and this is a Labor initiative that we trust the We also trust that it will not find any handicaps of the Treasurer, Mr Costello. there is a thing emerging in this place-in described as the Costello curse.

As the member for Werriwa in connection with this question, it arose by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts was made by that committee that the and to simplify the existing tax act. and then the exercise was undertaken by the the presence in the advisers' box of Mr Brian leader of that particular improvement project. again my appreciation, and that of the NA Wednesday, 16 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE committee and of the parliament, for the efforts here today who also participated in one way and to the minds of the committee members, the purposes for which that exercise was undertaken becomes an act, becomes operative and becomes involved with it in one way or another. Naturally, I harbour reservations about the to it. Ordinary taxpayers did not refer to the will many of the advisers refer to this act, handouts from the taxation department previously. doubt that ordinary taxpayers will, if they provisions, and be better able, hopefully, to conduct of their affairs to it. And it is to professional tax industry-will refer more frequently The exercise was undertaken because the original the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, so it has has been undertaken. During those 60 years, economy with increasingly sophisticated arrangements of taxpayers arranging their affairs, governments, and seeking to clarify some aspects of the tax in the tax law, have introduced changes from years. When the previous government was elected 1,100 pages long. I remember being critical because of that. I can understand why people the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) is now being critical that 1,100 pages has grown to 3,300 pages over legislative provisions which have became part to 5,000, and maybe even over 5,000 pages. So it was necessary for this exercise to be and easy reference to the way in which some overcome and the way in which the act has been at the end of the explanatory memorandum. For the provisions of the act in relation to within division 43-10. It restates the provisions were contained within the following parts: 124ZC(2A)(a) and (b), 124ZC(3)(a) and (b), 124ZH(1)(a) and (b), 124ZH(2)(a) and (b), I said to the previous Assistant Treasurer, to simplify the tax act was to make it more then perhaps this one might serve the purpose. I went to sleep pondering that ponderous previous a very useful exercise. The work that was team, together with the Joint Committee 5627 of Mr Nolan and those other people who are or another in that exercise. It was to my mind, a very valuable exercise. We would hope that will be achieved when the bill, when it available to all of those people who are extent to which the ordinary taxpayer will refer previous act, nor will they refer to this act. Nor as they depended-quite understandably-upon the But the thing about it is that there is no wish to go to the act, better understand its more correctly relate their activities and the be hoped that those tax advisers-people in the to it because it is more understandable. tax act, which this one now replaces, is been 60 years since any exercise of this kind as one might expect in an increasingly complex on the part of business and on the part responding to those changing circumstances law or seeking to close loopholes which develop time to time. That has been going on for 60 in 1983, the Income Tax Assessment Act was of the government that we replaced in 1983 like the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to of the previous Labor government, because that 13-year period. If we also include the of the Income Tax Assessment Act, it is closer undertaken. For those people who want a simple of these apparent complexities have been simplified, there are any number of examples Let me place one of them on the record. division 43, for example, the new law is contained of the existing act, the previous law, which 124ZC(1)(a) and (b), 124ZC(2)(a) and (b), 124ZC(4)(a) and (b), 124ZC(4A)(a) and (b), and 124ZH(2A)(a) and (b). That is not bad. George Gear, that if the exercise being undertaken attractive for me to read before I went to sleep, Certainly, Mr Deputy Speaker, neither you nor Income Tax Assessment Act. So it has been undertaken by the tax law improvement project of Public Accounts, was very valuable. NA 5628 The exercise was designed to a large extent costs associated with it. That is very difficult $3 billion and $6 billion every year. We can going into the professional tax industry in order Hopefully, this particular exercise will overcome year will be applied to other more productive many of whom could do with that sort of funding disappearing at the present time. There ambiguity, uncertainty and, in some places, the the old act. We all hope that this It was called the tax law improvement project. there is a suggestion in that title that the tax of the exercise. Neither Mr Nolan nor connection with it believed that that was the way in which the tax law is stated-not to it is stated. That has been the result of it. I want to make this observation: the problems in any tax system, including Australia's-however inherent underlying complexity of the tax system was it designed to-I am not suggesting that undertaken or of the rewritten tax act which purpose of that exercise. But we do need to address it. I know that one of the really big, contentious prior to and in connection with the federal goods and services tax. It was believed that So people might be entitled to say, 'Well, the system simplified.' I will tell you why I whole question. I would not support it because, to my mind, emphasis of tax from income tax to when people on those people who spend most of their income. What about those people who do not spend most is such that they are able to accumulate wealth portfolios, in various types of security arrangements? tax there. That is the main reason I opposed it. I have always been of the opinion, and continue difficulties inherent in that tax act and one of it is the fact that we tax income. And in you have to say what income is-and that is we include in income? We used not to include benefits. So any person who was able to accumulation of their wealth came in non-monetary from the sharks who evaded it and those people avoid it. Quite apart from them, there were MAIN COMMIITEE Wednesday, 16 October 1996 to reduce the problems of compliance and the to estimate. The estimates vary from between do more with funds of that kind than having them to clarify, interpret and apply the tax law. that and those $3 billion to $6 billion every and useful purposes, including my constituents, to replace a lot of the programs that are has been a need to overcome the complexity, apparent self-contradictions that existed within present exercise will achieve that. I do not want to make too much of that, but law was to be improved. That was not the purpose those people who worked with and for him in case. The exercise was designed to improve the improve the law but to improve the way in which of cost of compliance will not be overcome we might rewrite the tax law-until the itself is overcome. This does not do it. Nor that was a deficiency in the work that was is now made available to us; that was not the issues in this area was one which developed election in 1993, and that was the question of a that would simplify the system. Yes, it would. Bob Brown, why don't you support it? You want would not support it-and this is relevant to this the goods and services tax, in shifting the spend, would necessarily fall more heavily And who are they? They are my constituents. of their income, those people whose income and hold their savings, their investments, their There was no provision for an additional to be of the opinion, that one of the great of the basic underlying reasons for the complexity order to tax income you have to define income, the problem. What is income? What things do capital gains. We used not to include fringe arrange their affairs in such a way that the forms avoided tax. That was quite apart who deliberately manipulated the tax act to people who were legitimately able to minimise NA Wednesday, 16 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE the tax they paid-and that is a legitimate arranging their affairs in appropriate ways. So there is the whole question of identifying extent by saying, 'It does not matter where form it comes in. Apart from giving it away you either spend it or you hold it.' And that arrangement you can tax when they spend. tax what they hold as well. So you do not just income, you catch those people on the North most of their income aside. If we do that-if we tax what people spend You do not then have to define what income is and I will continue to oppose indirect taxes wealth that people are accumulating at the I will support it. That will remove the fundamental uncertainty, and the self-contradictory elements, we might choose to restate it. In relation to this exercise, let me refer problems that the public accounts committee Firstly, after the matter was referred to it, whether the project should proceed. Of course, was one of the recommendations. Secondly, as ail of the tax law was being rewritten whether it should be introduced progressively, introduced into the community all at once. because it is much better for it to be absorbed people become increasingly aware of it. This Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 is being restated the system. The third question that we had to determine include restatements of the law and changes the exercise.' We suggested that any changes they could not say, 'This is just a swiftie. You are changing the law.' We said that, to keep we would identify those changes in the explanatory people who want to see how the law has been but necessary-in connection' with There was also the question as to whether, continue to review taxation policy would be maintained. came down on the side of accepting-as I accept prerogative of governments to determine taxation do not give that responsibility to others. That government and it should rest with government, 5629 practice and a sensible and necessary one-by income. But we can overcome that to a large the income comes from, it does not matter what or burning it you can only do one of two things: can be identified. With a very sophisticated market That is the GST, but let me add something: you tax my constituents who spend most of their Shore as well, the people who are able to put and tax what people hold-I will endorse it. because it does not matter. That is my position, being imposed on expenditure until we hit the same time. When we choose to tax both of those underlying complexity, ambiguity and of the Income Tax Assessment Act, however to and put on the record some of the particular had to face in this exercise that it undertook. the committee had to come to some decision about the committee agreed that it should, and that and restated, the committee had to decide or held until it was completed and then We came down on the side of the first option gradually, or intruded into the system, so that is one of the first stages in that process: the and completed, and now we feed that into was whether the rewriting exercise should to it. We said, 'No. That is not the purpose of should keep faith with the community so that say that you are just rewriting the law, but you faith with the community, if we changed the law memorandum, and there they are. So changed-and the changes are fairly minimal, this exercise, can identify them. after this exercise, a comprehensive forum to I think that the committee, generally, absolutely-the responsibility, the right and policy. Certainly, you take advice, but you is the responsibility of government, it stays with whatever government that happens to be. NA 5630 There was also the question of whether a to emerging tax policy. We did not pursue that matter which has still to be resolved The sixth question was the one that I referred People will say that it is written for taxpayers. written for the tax professionals and the courts. never refer to the tax act itself. Although, version, more of them may be encouraged to necessarily written for taxpayers. But we accept, one of the purposes of this was to simplify the of education and understanding who wanted it said. Anyone who has referred to the old tax what that said in many cases. The degree of litigation referred to indicate some of the great difficulties of whether some of the rulings and determinations particular tax questions and issues and problems came down on the side of believing that that it did, and I have no particular I want to take this opportunity, also, to Public Accounts that it review the unworkable member in this parliament of the Joint Committee enormously the privilege of being associated In conclusion, I would prefer the Joint examination of the possible general tax framework the point that I was making before: it is a order to tax it or whether we adopt a different approach. If the Joint Committee of Public Accounts systems of taxation would be available disadvantages of that may be, there might the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. As committees of the parliament, all of which, to these questions. This is one area where, continue to have conflict on a partisan basis. tend to lock into the system all of those problems, contradictions which have been in the system of the tax act will necessarily be able to overcome.",144

Certainly, though, the fact that we are here support for these bills shows that there is political scene in this country that there was my friend the honourable member for Charlton the examples of just how ridiculous the existing and with some haste. As has also been mentioned, the Joint Committee in the previous parliament and then again committee came down with a report recently, taking submissions on the issues of the legislation that there was a range of concerns from practitioners legislation. Certainly, we endeavoured to traverse up on those occasions, and I think Beyond that, the biggest issue which came government has taken into account-is the concern through that consultation process that were arguments on both sides. I have some by those favouring the date as it was proposed have been 1 July 1996, was certainly more about to stress today is the fact that the accounting legislation now, not in 12 months time.

The fact is that there are accounting practitioners legislation-and that was explained to us Committee of Public Accounts. I accept the argument that they have to. But the fact was, detail of what is coming through, and they have set date in this legislation-the middle of next coming into effect in the very near future and are going to have real difficulties in the transitional technical amendments, most of them'taking into There are a couple of issues I would like considerations of the Joint Committee of Public 5631 continue to do, I suspect, for some years to is bigger than Ben Hur. It is a huge task, and to be crossed until it is completed. bill, which actually proposes to replace consequential amendment bills, which will amend that contain references to the Income Tax and the transitional provisions bill, which will to apply. The legislation as it stands is based under the previous government. The tax law government that I was proud to be a member of today in a situation where there is bipartisan an understanding across the parliamentary and a need for major changes. The previous speaker, (Mr Robert Brown), has gone into some of legislation is. Vast changes need to occur, on Public Accounts considered this matter at the commencement of this parliament. The after quite a number of public hearings and and what it is proposing. It is fair to say in the field about aspects of the a number of technical issues which came that a reasonable job was done. up-and which I am pleased to see that the issue of retrospectivity. There was widespread this legislation ought not be retrospective. There sympathy with both. The argument that was put in the original draft legislation, which would creating a shock. The one thing I would like and taxation industry has to grapple with this have to get to the guts of it right now, because bill there are, in effect, major changes to who have no idea what is really in this through the consultation process of the Joint argument that they should and I accept the and is, that they do not really understand the to come to grips with it quickly. There is a year. That signals very clearly that it will be people had better come to grips with it or they process. The rest of these bills largely is account the question of the change of dates. to touch on briefly which were also part of the Accounts. They were not necessarily taken NA 5632 up in this legislation but relate to it very significantly. a revenue committee. The previous speaker, had not addressed that issue. I think it is fair report. The situation as the committee saw it is says: The Government should provide sufficient (a) the Joint Committee of Public Account to oversight simplification issues that are highlighted recommendations to government; or (b) the establishment of a Joint Standing Committee to review all matters in relation to Commonwealth government; or (c) the establishment of a joint select committee tax policy simplification issues referred government. If I could paraphrase one of the major concerns from a range of industry representatives it and as difficulties are discovered-as they quickly would those sorts of issues be addressed. it was something that cost the government revenue, and brutal; if the situation was the reverse of full consideration of the issues ad nauseam. The hope is-and it is certainly the hope addressed quickly, effectively and efficiently is also the wish of people in the TLIP. But I have been here, I think there need to be some otherwise things may not get addressed. On three variations on the theme that the government of room there for the government to decide own preference, but I would say that any of for pursuing the matter in the future. Another issue of concern related to the question the report says: Technical errors in the Income Tax Assessment Bill corrections should either be incorporated in future Tax Assessment Act 1936 or be dealt with as part of by the Australian Taxation Office, whichever process legislation should become the regular vehicle Again, the arguments I have put regarding the sort are relevant here: action is needed on changes need to be done must be acted upon quickly. Another issue which came up was the question as it stands is that so much of the detail is in many respects is actually contained in Recommendation 2 of the report says: MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 1996 For example, there is the question of the member for Charlton, mentioned that the JCPA to say that it has, to a greater extent, in its final stated in recommendation 11 of the report which additional resources to allow either: the processes for resolving the minor tax policy by the Tax Law Improvement Project and make on Revenue with terms of reference and powers revenue and to make recommendations to with terms of reference and powers to assess the minor to it by Parliament and to make recommendations to expressed through the consultation process was that, as the legislation comes into operation will be, as has been conceded by all sides-how The point was made that if, for example, the odds were that action would be swift that, in the fullness of time it might require a of the committee-that those matters can be to meet the concerns of the industry. I think that from what I have seen of this place in the years very formal processes to address those matters, the question of options, the committee put down could pick up and I think there is plenty on what they see as the best option. I have my the options mentioned certainly give a firm basis on technical errors. Recommendation 9 of 1996 should be corrected as a matter of priority. The instalments of the legislation to replace the Income the technical corrections process recently put in place is quicker. Furthermore, technical amendments for making technical corrections to tax law. previous issue of a revenue committee of some as they are discovered and variations that of rulings. The nature of the taxation system in the actual legislation, but so much more detail rulings done by the Commissioner of Taxation. NA Wednesday, 16 October 1996 The Commissioner of Taxation and the major tax bodies agree, as a matter of urgency, to a process and timetable by the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 and subsequent to rewriting individual Rulings should be determined The public statement should also include a completion I understand that there may have been some developments any details. What I would say is Another issue that was raised with us through rulings. Essentially, if both are not fixed, then that action is also crucial and further Another issue that I will mention is the question legislation. An argument that was put to us was through the process of this legislation. difficulty in terms of quantifying I do not pretend to be a taxation expert something go from one size down to another sense-that there is an improvement. From looking looking at some of the points that were made there will be substantial savings over time legislation. Certainly, it is agreed that, in practitioners are becoming accustomed to progressively introduced, there will be difficulties accepts that that is necessary in However, one recommendation which the JCPA Office should undertake or assist with further compliance in Australia. Again, I am no expert, phenomenal. There is some figure work available of what these changes will do, in terms of reducing best. I suspect that when that work is done, we for that work to be done because the one thing legislation going through this place is an element relates not only to the question of conflicts outcomes, but it is also a question of dollars the real effect of a change is, then we have is in that change. On this occasion, I think that and wish it a speedy passage through both houses to be able, for our own sake, and for the worth.' As I mentioned earlier, this legislation improvement project is, as the member of Charlton but of simplification. That simplification is be applied. I will not go into a number of we should actually have, although I would concur about the nature of the sort of taxation system taxation law debate is similar, in many respects, It is very easy to have very long and involved MAIN COMMITTEE 5633 (through the National Tax Liaison Group) should for rewriting existing Public Rulings affected legislation.

I have not seen that that is of particular urgency. this process is the question of legislation and in many respects, nothing is fixed. Therefore, advancements need to be made on that basis. of the actual savings associated with this that there were significant savings to be made However, when debate occurred, there was some the actual real value of these changes. in any way, shape or form, but when you see size, you tend to think-at least in a visual at some of the detail there-for example, by the member for Charlton-one tends to think in terms of the time taken to actually apply the the short term, in the first couple of years while the new system, and as the system is being and additional costs. I think that everyone order to get a better long-term system. put forward was that the Australian Taxation research attempting to quantify the costs of tax but I suspect that the costs are absolutely on those issues, but certainly the question and minimising that cost, is uncertain at will find that it is quite significant. But I urge that we certainly need to try to ensure with of accountability. And that accountability of interest, nor to practical applications and and of real effect. If we cannot quantify what got to really question just how much value there there is value. I certainly support the legislation of the parliament. But I think we also ought ATO's sake, to actually say, 'This is what it is and the whole process through the taxation law said, not a question of actual improvement, an improvement in terms of the way the law will arguments about the question of what taxation law in many respects with the previous speaker we should have. But I would also say that to discussions that I have had on religion. arguments and it is often confusing. In the end NA 5634 it seems to come down sometimes to articles articles of faith, as I am sure others do. I wish those involved in getting it together. I wish dealing with the rest of this process.

Regardless of the few, I suggest, could argue with the fact in so many countries is continuing to grow. the question of aid and I hope that it will NA 5674 continue. Despite our living in a technologically throughout the world. As was said during the seminar by a representative needs of the world, approximately 800 million world today. About one billion people do not do not have access to safe water and two billion Approximately 30 per cent of land in Africa is 20 per cent of land in Asia. There are about world today. To add to that list of needs, the the un met infrastructure needs in East Asia decade. Poverty is not only persistent, but in the giving greater polarisation between the rich are worse off today than they were 10 years they were 15 years ago. Infant mortality population saw their share of global income years. Perhaps the most dramatic statistic presented 358 billionaires exceed the combined annual world's population. That is something that that you are in the chair, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - not were kind enough to relieve me-as I know that statistic with your interest in poverty reduction billionaires of the world exceeds the combined of the world's population. To hear many members of the general public this place, one would think that Australia today than they were 10 years ago. Like many Australia is heading for Third World status. my electorate and say that Australia is heading them is to ask when they were last in a Third we might have in this country, and I sometimes country are never as great as many imagine, problems of Third World countries. I suggest exchange their problems for ours. As such, aid-a moral as well as a practical responsibility. Having said that, when large amounts of aid it goes for the purpose granted. That is, international organisations untied aid, but I with a country, we have a right to say where a member of the committee that brought down visited that country with the right honourable people, I was very strongly for the recommendations to PNG should go from untied to tied. I think Everyone who was on that committee and who MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 16 October 1996 advanced age, there is a persistence of poverty of AusAid, describing the development to 1.3 billion live in absolute poverty in the have access to basic health services, 1.3 billion do not have access to sanitation services. affected by significant degradation, as is about 54 million refugees and displaced persons in the vice-president of the World Bank indicated that alone require $1.9 trillion in investment over the post-Cold War world, it is a growing phenomenon and poor. A sobering statistic is that 89 countries ago, and 1.6 billion people are worse off than is rising. Twenty-one per cent of the world's decline from 2.3 to 1.4 per cent over the last 30 at the seminar was that the assets of the world's incomes of countries with 45 per cent of the we should consider, and I am particularly pleased only because I should be there and you you would have a particular interest in that throughout the world. The income of the 358 annual income of countries with 45 per cent talk about aid, and indeed some members in was one of those 89 countries that are worse off members, I hear ill-informed comments that When people come up to me or write letters to for Third World status, my usual response to World country. Regardless of what problems think, I must say, that the problems in this these problems pale into insignificance with the that most Third World countries would readily we have a responsibility and a duty to continue are given, I believe it is our right to ensure that I have been in favour of giving to some of the think that when we give aid on a one-to-one basis it should go.

Labour 42 Market Programs (LMPs) have been in place since 62 the early 1970s and have been subject to significant 10386 changes over that period. New programs have been introduced, some discontinued and others have had their client eligibility criteria and program parameters changed. Statistics at the program level are, however, available from the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs's (DEETY A) computer systems from 1990-91 onwards. To go back further would, however, require a significant use of Departmental resources which I am not prepared to authorise. The following tables set out details of LMP activity since 1990-91, for the Honourable Member's information. I have also provided the Honourable Member with a copy of the DEETYA booklet entitled ""Programs 1995-96"" which outlines all current LMPs.

Jobskills and Landcare and Environment Action Program The JobSkills and Landcare and Environment Action Program (LEAP) operate on a contractual basis which allows for both project and individual placements. Each contract is managed by a broker which may be any organisation whose tender is assessed initially on its capacity to provide the services required and then assessed comparatively against other tenders. To be assessed as suitable,'brokers must provide evidence of: a proven organisational infrastructure and as,ound financial capacity/solvency to provide the required services on a cost effective basis; an ability to identify the work skills and training needs of the target group and to tailor services to their needs including the provision of appropriate work experience, training, supervision and support arrangements; an ability to effectively monitor the progress of participants and provide financial and other reports to DEETYA; JobSkills brokers are required to demonstrate an ability to negotiate industrial relations issues where necessary; and, LEAP brokers are required to demonstrate experience relevant to landcare, environment, conservation practices or cultural heritage. New Work Opportunities The new Work Opportunities (NWO) operates on a project basis which are managed by a broker who may be any organisation or employer within the community. The provision of funding depends on the quality of the proposal, likely employment outcomes for participants and the assessed capacity and suitability of the broker to manage a NWO project. To be assessed as suitable, brokers must provide evidence of: their legal and financial status; their previous involvement and experience, if any, with DEETYA programs and clients; funding sought under other employment, education and training programs for the project; whether there are outstanding or unacquitted government funds; a project proposal that provides details about such things as the location of the project, a budget summary, transport and access arrangements, supervision and mentoring arrangements, training delivery arrangements and the nature of the 26 weeks work experience and training. Proposed Badgerys Creek Airport: Consultants (Question No. 540) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: Will he approve financial assistance to local community groups to enable them to employ an expert consultant to assist them prepare their (a) submissions to the environmental impact study for the proposed airport at Badgerys Creek and (b) comments on the study's subsequent recommendations. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government is committed to a thorough, objective and transparent environmental assessment process, with extensive consultation consistent with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney in 1995. At this time no decision has been made by the Government on financial support for local communities to take part in the EIS process for the second Sydney airport. This issue will be considered by the Government before the release of the draft EIS. Funding Proposals (Question No. 566) Mr Crean asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Will he provide a list of all proposals received seeking funding through the programs affected by measures announced in his statement of 17 July 1996 on regional development specifying (a) which proposals will no longer be considered for funding, (b) in respect of each proposal, (i) its location, (ii) its proponents and (iii) a brief description and (c) in respect of each proposal, the sums (i) sought and (ii) to be derived from other sources. (2) Did he state that sums of $10 million and $80 million are still available for regional development; if so, what proportion of the sums involves funding of commitments entered into before 17 July 1996. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l)(a)(b)(c) See Attachment A. (2) $80 million has been allocated to fund contracted commitments entered into before 17 July 1996. $10 million has been allocated in total over the next two years.

279,Mr SPEAKER,TOTAL,"On 19 September 1996, the member for Kooyong addressed a question to the Acting Speaker concerning procedures for authorities to correct any errors which might be made in their annual reports to the parliament, specifically referring to the National Crime Authority's annual report for 1994-95. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Government Departments and authorities are usually required by legislation to present reports the operation of the department or authority during the year ending on 30 June. The contents of such reports are presumed to be correct. Where an error of substance has subsequently been detected, the usual course would be for a corrigendum, or erratum, slip to be issued, or a copy of the report containing corrected information could be tabled in substitution for the copy containing the incorrect information, depending on the magnitude of the error. \ It is not within my area of responsibility to comment on the correctness of any specific segment of a National Crime Authority Annual Report. on The records of the House reveal that the National Crime Authority Report for 1994-95 was presented to the House on 25 October 1995. There is no record of a corrigenda or substitute copy being presented to the House. I believe that the Attorney General and Minister for Justice has written to the honourable Member concerning the specific matters raised in the question.",223
