Shortland electorate is an older electorate, that is probably the 10th oldest in the country over the age of 65. People in the electorate care reforms. Those mean more packages; more their homes longer; they will not have to sell aged-care available for them, and the certainty There is more money to the councils; more Paid Parental Leave scheme has been accessed and the 'dads and partner pay'.

18,Mr HARTSUYKER,BILLS," I today on the appropriation bills 2013-14. This they have suspected for some time-that is, control and Australians are paying a high Prime Minister and her government. If government to understand why they have lost the trust of budget and do two things: firstly, members sitting down and objectively seeking the detail they should take the time to read the ministerial budget night. If members opposite do those two of trust between the government and the Australian honest with themselves, they will find there their ministers are peddling Over the past five years, federal Labor become accustomed and conditioned to believing media releases. They believe they can spin a resolved. They believe that, if they can grab seen it time and again: an education revolution, the government's commitment to return to surplus I could go on and on, but the reality is still press release without any thought as to how policy by press release without any regard to policy by press release which relies on government this point for the 2013-14 budget, a document wrong with this government. I would like to take time today to highlight more government spin and deception. I would budget's failure to deliver a roadmap for our the day with a legacy of debt, unfunded There is no better example of this spin than As someone who represents an electorate in issue, I know every budget has a direct connection this year, the member for Grayndler and the that is the way with so many things. When it there is only one choice, and that is this to the people of Australia a fair society, a and were each and every person is valued. the opposition are in government after September, bonus benefits so many people within the regularly asking about when the next instalment instalment on 1 July, and families in Shortland budget that will continue to deliver to the welcome the opportunity to address members budget confirms to the Australian people what the government is in chaos, the budget is out of price for the waste and mismanagement by our backbenchers and the cross-benchers want the Australian people, they should look at this opposite should be honest with themselves by of their own budget papers; and, secondly, media releases which were distributed on things, they will get a sense of why the bond people is broken-because, if they are is a complete disconnect between the messages and the reality of this budget. have delivered government through spin. They have they can fool the Australian people through line to the Australian people, and the issue is a headline, the problem is addressed. We have the East Timor solution to stopping the boats, and a carbon tax to address climate change. the same when it comes to this budget-policy by it is going to be implemented and at what cost; the nation's finances and its impact on taxpayers; deception. So it is that we have arrived at which essentially epitomises everything that is to members opposite how this budget is just like to draw to members' attention to the nation, instead saddling the next government of promises and budgetary disarray. what we have seen in relation to infrastructure. which the Pacific Highway is a very important to the schedule of works. On budget night Minister for Infrastructure and Transport issued media releases lauding this budget for its infrastructure throughout my electorate, the minister claimed more than $3.3 billion would commence construction news-if only we could believe this government. to grab a headline for the government; and, But most north coast residents have learned over They want to know the funding has been included contracts being awarded and they want to fixed and they want their elected leaders to works. So, in that context, what does this budget given the minister's claim that more than months? The first and most crucial fact in this budget Highway. Not one extra dollar is detailed in under expense measures, there is a long list will be funded through to 2019. The Pacific is mentioned, the New England Highway is mentioned, Highway. However, the budget papers Commonwealth contributions to major infrastructure An optimist might hope that this will include to have a closer look at the total infrastructure completion date of the Pacific Highway. When infrastructure spend, guess what? It has gone all the press releases from Minister Albanese, member for Lyne, what we do know is that this spending on road and rail has been cut from $36 years. Effectively this is a cut of $1.2 billion a year. How does this impact on the Pacific Highway? Department of Infrastructure and Transport's government had deferred expenditure on the announced that $1.025 billion would be department has now confirmed that has been set aside $1.4 billion in 2015-16. That has now 2015-16, Labor's funding commitment to the Senate estimates yesterday, just $145 million highway in 2016-17 and this will drop to This clearly shows that under Labor north years and years before the duplication will and buried. Labor is now telling north coast will be waiting until way beyond 2020 before walked away from the 80-20 funding model funding, despite signing an 80-20 arrangement upgrade of the Bruce Highway. That is despite the Bolivia Hill project on the New England spend. In media releases distributed that five Pacific Highway projects totalling between now and mid-2014. Great The clear intent of these media releases was with some media outlets, I will admit it worked. the past five years to ignore media releases. in the budget. They want to witness the see construction underway. They want the road be honest with them with regard to the schedule of deliver for the Pacific Highway, especially $3 billion of work will commence in the next 15 is that there is no new money for the Pacific the budget papers. In fact, in Budget Paper No. 2, of new road projects which the government says Highway is not mentioned. The Bruce Highway but there is no mention of the Pacific do note that the government will continue projects from 2014-15 to 2017-18. the Pacific Highway. A realist is more likely spend and question how it will impact on the we have a closer look at the government's total down. That is right, it has gone down. Despite and all the spin from people such as the budget has confirmed that total infrastructure billion over six years to $24 billion over five In Senate estimates yesterday, we heard the Mike Mrdak confirm that the Gillard Pacific Highway. In last year's budget, it was spent by the Commonwealth in 2014-15. The cut to $625 million. Last year the government been cut almost in half to $770 million. After highway slows to a trickle. As Mr Mrdak told from the Commonwealth will be spent on the just $75 million in both 2017-18 and 2018-19. coast residents are going to be waiting years and be completed. The 2016 completion date is dead residents that if Julia Gillard is re-elected they the highway will be completed. Labor has with New South Wales and now insist on 50-50 with the Queensland government for the the government agreeing to an 80-20 split for Highway. Why is it good enough for the Bruce Highway in Queensland and for the New England for the Pacific Highway, for some unknown 50? North coast residents are sick of the The coalition will restore the 80-20 funding Highway and commit $5.6 billion towards the Wales commitment of $1.5 billion, this will duplication of the road. On 14 September, voters with a rock-solid commitment to the Pacific and endless deceit. It is not just the Pacific Highway where relation to education funding, we have also budget night, we had the government hailing reforms. The joint press release from the Education said: The Gillard Government has made a $9.8 billion commitment along with better indexation and reforms to lift student Improvement. All very welcome, except for the fact that release. Gonski is the headline and $9.8 billion fund these reforms. But, when you look at the a very different story. The truth is that education According to the budget papers, $2.8 billion next four years, but the additional $2.8 billion in cuts to school education and redirections period. The government are discontinuing socio-economic schools, ending reward payments schools and cutting literacy and numeracy funding, of the discontinued programs, there is a further aside for non-government schools when compared last year's budget to this year's figures, the $325 million over four years. Labor is relying governments to prop up its floundering school-funding universities, student income support, apprenticeships education expenses. Southern Cross University, electorate, has now started offering voluntary government cuts. After six years of promises and declining uncertainty within the education sector. That Minister for School Education, Early Childhood was unable to explain, on a weekend political expect in the next financial year. It is just mismanaged the issue. To date, only one state the deadline the Prime Minister set, of 30 June. Highway at Bolivia Hill to be on 80-20, yet reason, the Labor government is demanding 50needless delays. They just want the road fixed. model for the completion of the Pacific upgrade. Combining that with the New South deliver the $7 billion required to complete the will have a clear choice: a federal coalition Highway, or Labor's ongoing fudging of figures there are serious questions about this budget. In seen Labor's sleight of hand. Once again, on its funding for what is known as the Gonski Prime Minister and the Minister for School to increase school funding over six years, achievement, under the National Plan for School it is wrong. Once again, we have policy by press is the government's magical figure required to cold, hard reality of the budget papers, they tell will actually be cut as a result of this budget. of so-called Gonski reforms will be paid over the over four years will be offset by $3.126 billion of national partnerships funding over the same the national partnerships funding for low to teachers, axing cash bonus payments for all of which will save $2.1 billion. On top $1 billion reduction in ongoing funding set to last year's budget. When you compare overall budget reveals that education will lose entirely on extra funding from the state model. Labor has also cut funding to and training and tax deductions for selfwhich has a substantial presence in my redundancies as a result of the Gillard student outcomes, Labor is creating more uncertainty was laid bare for all to see when the and Youth, the member for Kingsford Smith, program, how much funding the states could another example of how the Gillard government has has signed up, and the reforms are approaching That is not the way to deliver national school funding reform for the next generation of students, to spin rather than good policy. The final area I would like to focus on is management. I have already touched on how Labor the Pacific Highway and school funding to know Prime Minister's promise that there would And then there was the promise that we were billion surplus and $70 billion in the bank from have now saddled the nation with a mountain set to breach our $300 billion debt ceiling. Last year, the Treasurer announced that albeit a small one of $1.5 billion. We all knew shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, when he said that Labor would never deliver Minister or the Treasurer. Between them, occasions. The Prime Minister guaranteed it. believed that, if they said it often enough, this side of the chamber knew the truth. And broke his surplus promise. On the back of the 2009-10, $47.5 billion in 2010-11 and $43.4 billion will have a small deficit. Just as Pinocchio's Treasurer's deficit got larger and larger every budget night, the Treasurer confirmed that the deficit; it had now turned into a $19.4 billion It is incredible that we have a government the Australian people with endless spin and can We are now told, 'Trust me: in just a few surplus.' We have heard it all before. 'It was wait a few years and eventually we will get coalition has the opportunity to form a management and to deny the current Treasurer deficits as far as the eye can see. He has mismanagement. The Australian people know hope that on 14 September we are able to deliver, coalition government to restore the strong needs. Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (10:50): In speaking Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2013-2014 and (No. 1) 2013-2014, I would like to remind us address in reply to the budget on 16 May: We are a great country and a great I think that very succinctly sums up the disappointed people living in Forde are with in my electorate have been struggling under but we have a government that is addicted the issue of budget debt and deficit and economic cannot be trusted. We only have to look at that. But of course there has also been the be no carbon tax under the government she led. going to have a surplus. Having inherited a $20 the coalition, in just six years the government of debt. According to the budget papers, we are in 2012-13 the budget would return to surplus, the government were fudging the figures. The spoke for all of us on this side of the House a surplus. But that did not stop the Prime they promised a surplus on no less than 500 It was almost as if the PM and the Treasurer it would materialise. Meanwhile, the rest of us on it was so. Just before Christmas, the Treasurer deficits of $27 billion in 2008-09, $54 billion in in 2011-12, the Treasurer revealed that he nose got longer and longer every time he lied, the time he mentioned it, to the point that, on $1.5 billion surplus had not turned into a small deficit, a staggering $21 billion turnaround. who continue to believe that they can deceive continue to peddle the same sorts of promises. years time. I'm going to deliver an $800 million going to be a $1½ million surplus this year; now there.' I would hope in September that the government, to restore responsible financial the opportunity to deliver more and more form on deficits and he has form on financial they cannot trust this government and I would with the support of the Australian people, a economic management that this country so much on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill what the Leader of the Opposition said in his people let down by a bad government. situation. Almost every day I am reminded how the present government. Many small businesses this government's policies. They tell me there is absolutely no confidence in the business community. who struggle to have three square meals a day, night and who struggle daily with the high their whole lives to support their own government's new or increased taxes and punitive We have families dealing with cost-of-living Mum and dad both have to work to keep up with the number of so-called middle-income families Even young adults are starting to feel disappointed figuring out that Labor's plan for their futures They are comparing their lives to those of young people now are resigned to the fact home. On a community level, we have a number groups and charities that are also doing it rely on volunteers. They have been wrapped coming from this government. Mr Mitchell interjecting Mr VAN MANEN: I always appreciate contributions member for MCEwen! So many of us feel uncertain government. We all feeling disappointed because promised so much but delivered so little that that they had lost their way. I would respectfully this unnecessary pressure on households and cannot be trusted and a government which It is worth considering that the revenue in year of the coalition government, but spending will potentially deliver total gross debt which forward estimates; Labor's fifth record deficit come; with no credible plan back to surplus; and family payments; more than $25 billion in extra $100 million spending on government advertising. This is a budget that does nothing to help the rising cost-of-living pressures, economic uncertainty would like to quote the chief executive of Peter Anderson, when he stated: The federal budget does little to take cost pressure This is right around the country. In his statement small businesses employing some seven million turn its back on this sector. On his analysis of the budget,  No company tax relief;  Higher personal income tax (Medicare levy);  No capital gains tax relief; There are seniors on pensions in Forde who cannot afford to leave the lights on at cost of living. I have retirees who have planned retirement, only now to be burdened by this changes to legislation and superannuation. pressures who have little or no savings left. these costs and we are seeing an increase in turning to local welfare groups for support. with this government because they are will include an inheritance of debt and deficit. their parents and are feeling envious, as many that they may never be able to afford their own of welfare organisations, clubs, support tough because the majority of these organisations up in the burden of red tape and regulation from my learned colleague the about where we are headed under this this government under Kevin Rudd initially it cost him his job. The new Prime Minister said suggest that they are yet to find it. Much of businesses is coming from a government which has a huge spending and forecasting problem. 2013-14 is some $80 billion higher than the last is some $120 billion higher. The last budget will breach the $300 billion debt ceiling in in five years, with at least two more deficits to more broken promises, such as scrapped tax cuts higher taxes over the next four years; and, an individuals, families and business owners with and poor services. To illustrate this, I the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, off the private sector, especially small business … he said that there were around two million people and yet the government continues to Mr Anderson found that there was:  No cost offset to fund the 1st  No restoration of incentives for hiring new apprentices;  No reduction in tax compliance and red-tape. He also said: Business is once again asked to bear the brunt burden next year will add to business costs and measures that collectively make To quote Mr Anderson once again: Budget deficits indicate that fiscal policy needs review"" of government spending, a detailed plan regulatory, tax and workplace policy so that the monetary policy. The Institute of Public Accountants Small businesses across Australia can expect further … The IPA chief executive officer, Andrew Conway, states: Instead of a reduction in the regulatory burden support the vital small business sector, we find to promote the small business sector. But there is hope. The coalition has a plan for red tape. We have a plan, and our plan is aimed and a safe and secure future for Australia. The old adage is that 'if you fail to plan, Minister and the Treasurer failed to set out let alone for the longer term. So how can we about the following year, or the next decade? the Treasurer plans to pay for the big-ticket Henry Ford: You can't build a reputation on what you are going to do Or as my late friend Brian Klemmer once said: There is no fairer way to gauge something After six years of Labor we now have organisations with National Economic and Social Impact respondents are unable to pay their bills on time of an emergency.

23,Ms ODWYER,BILLS," I rise to 2014, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2013-2014 Bill (No. 1) 2013-2014. Unfortunately, my comments I have made about previous appropriation past, the government's rhetoric has not been the Treasurer last year that he would deliver billion surplus. He made the grand statement surplus years were ahead. How wrong could This deficit was a deficit of upwards of $19 billion surplus that was promised. What we also discovered in the budget papers Treasurer has raised throughout his time from now $300 billion will in fact exceed the gross period. Why is this so? It is because this current budget-has not been able to, as Wayne Swan as economic calls right'. And the implications result. Let us not forget where we came from. We government took over in 2007. We had paid off Future Fund, with more than $60 billion of assets. surplus-was delivered, with a $20 billion position where there are deficits that add Treasurer, and we have a gross debt ceiling Why are the debts and deficits so concerning? fiscal incompetence, and that has a direct cost more. They are actually having to now pay borrowing. And they are paying more than $35 interest payments that are accumulating But why is this important? It is important things that we should be focused on as a country: infrastructure that we require. Many of you would know that in this place railway crossings in Victoria. We have compared to only eight in Sydney. This has a done, in terms of the time that people spend on their way to work or on their way home from doing something else. It is, in fact, a productivity Victorian government to make provision for railway But I do not think that sort of behaviour is environment today. I seek leave to table the speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2013and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) speech to this chamber is quite similar to the bills-that is, this year, just as in years matched by the reality. We heard a promise from surpluses-that this budget would be a $1.5 that the deficit years were behind us and the he be. He again delivered yet another deficit. billion-almost $20 billion; hardly the $1.5 was that the gross debt ceiling that the $75 billion to $200 billion to $250 billion to debt ceiling over the current forward estimates government has not been able to manage the Treasurer puts it so well himself, 'get the big are very severe for the Australian people as a came from a very different period before this $96 billion of Labor's debt. We had created a Surplus after surplus-record surplus after surplus in the bank. We have now gone to a up to more than $192 billion as a result of this approaching, at its peak, more than $370 billion. This government is borrowing to pay for its for every Australian taxpayer. They are paying an interest bill based on the government's million a day to pay for the $8 billion worth of each and every year. because it means that we cannot focus on the paying for those services and the vital I have spoken a lot about the need to get rid of more than 172 railway crossings in Victoria, significant impact on our ability to get things in cars waiting at these railway crossings whether work. This is time that could be better spent issue. Despite the repeated requests from the crossings in their Infrastructure Australia bid, not one new dollar of funding has been crossings. I myself speak from some experience having have, in my electorate of Higgins, some of state. The Murrumbeena Road-Neerim Road rated as the worse level crossing in the state federal dollar has been allocated for its improvement. government, despite the lack of support from significant commitments to abolish more than in stark contrast to Labor's record when it years in government, it abolished only two. government is abolishing five within its first not of talk. Another issue that concerns me in the current seen repeated claims from this government that for every Australian. But since 2007 we all know 93.8 per cent and other important costs have and medical and health services by more than family budget. We all know that one of the factors which the coalition has promised to abolish. This business. It is not just in these areas that we are seeing to access affordable and flexible child care. that the government has increased red tape and has increased the cost of running and providing increased by more than 22 per cent in a matter current budget we have seen the government rebate has been frozen. No indexation will be wish to access child care hundreds of dollars a care, they have frozen the childcare rebate, communities. Another issue I wish to raise in relation to government thinks it is being very clever Gonski recommendations were quite different recommended that there be more than $6.5 billion and every year over the forward estimates period, has promised though over the forward estimates is $2.8 billion-a very significant reduction. has done with the figures and look at the tables you realise that the situation is even worse deliver Gonski. It has actually cut schools funding by reallocating existing funding and changing four years is $325 million. provided to Victoria to abolish these railway followed this question very closely, because I the worse examples of railway crossings in the Murrumbeena railway crossing is constantly according to the RACV Redspot Survey. Not one I am happy to say, though, that the state the federal government in this area, has made five railway crossings in the state, which stands was in government at a state level: during its 11 I am pleased to see that the coalition state term of government. It is a government of action, budget relates to the cost of living. We have they are going to decrease the cost of living that the cost of electricity has increased by gone up, such as gas by more than 61.8 per cent 40.9 per cent. This has a direct impact on the in increasing these costs is the carbon tax, will be our first priority, our first order of increased costs. It is harder for families now It is harder for a number of reasons. The first is regulation on childcare centres. In doing so it childcare services. Childcare costs have of only two years. In addition to that, in this make it even harder for families. The childcare paid. It will cost every family with children who year. So, in addition to raising the cost of child putting more pressure on families in our the appropriation bills is education funding. The promising to deliver the Gonski reforms. The from what we see in the budget. Gonski of new funding provided for schools each which is $26 billion. What the government period and provided for in the budget papers When you actually look at what the government and the charts and examine them line by line, than simply not delivering on their promise to by more than $325 million. It has done this funding arrangements. The cut over the next So far from an education revolution, it has who expected so much given what the government educational outcomes for all Australian students. allocated efficiently and effectively. Cutting government has done will hurt our ability education-the education that they deserve. They have not just cut schools funding; educational institutions-$2.3 billion to universities. This comes off the back of their and research sector as well. We all know that comes to medical health and research, but we why the coalition have stated very emphatically health and research. We certainly will not cut that we have seen this current government figures add up in this budget, play around and ARC funding arrangements and payments, arrears rather than in advance so that there who is receiving those payments. The other issue that I wish to raise in the most certainly failed in their commitment promise they make every election is that they budget we see them deferring out each and examine the budget figures closely, it is substantial portion of our foreign aid budget out for border protection. Australia is actually aid, because about $375 million of the foreign onshore processing of asylum seekers. This is made much mention of for fairly obvious reasons. In the final time remaining to me, I would do in order to try and plug their significant week from the Reserve Bank and from the Treasury. Reserve Bank governor-the very emphatic raided the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund of more black hole that the Treasurer has created in The RBA's capital fund is now So, in a nutshell, this government has made Australia on the wrong path.

I secondly want to make the argue, is the very substantial prevalence of been a con, a cruel hoax on so many Australians had said. We want to see better We want to make sure that the money is education funding in the way that this to ensure that our students receive the best they have also cut funding to our higher our universities and support for students at quite extraordinary cuts to the medical health Australia punches above its weight when it should not jeopardise that in any way.

It has put the priorities right again so that we can restore am very pleased to rise to speak on this of particular concern, which is the standards of industry and public sector superannuation there are numerous troubling instances of point that a major factor behind this, I would union appointed directors in industry and public sector superannuation funds. I thirdly want recommended wholesale reform of governance called equal representation model-a recommendation repeatedly ignored by the minister, the member venture to suggest, not unrelated to his background Union and a director of an industry superannuation fund. Let me turn to the issue of governance problems. the retirement incomes of Australians. (Supervision) Act, we see the 'sole purpose' superannuation fund to ensure that the fund member of the fund. It is hard to avoid the conclusion, directors of funds tend to honour this in the breach. I want to talk firstly about the troubling branch of the construction and general division industry superannuation fund Cbus. This construction company Grocon. Earlier this Setka, said his members were angry that Cbus Sydney. 'I reckon it's a slap in the face for as saying. The CFMEU has subsequently sought expressions funds to become the default fund for Cbus members. union to use the economic resources of a substantial influence, including the right to political outcomes, in this case to advance What would such action mean for the should consider that the property development presumably with a view to maximising the remember that many of the 655,000 members of interests as members of the fund which must industrial agenda of the CFMEU.

The Meat Industry Employees' Superannuation made a $30 million investment in a building was lost when Austcorp collapsed in 2009. The a long-term secretary of the meat workers union the fund, was paid significant consultancy searches, Mr Jon Addison, who is a director Fund, has been at various times a director Austcorp Group Ltd. At the very least, these facts raise questions facing Mr Curran and Mr Addison. They were superannuation fund charged with the custody collar workers. The question arises: how did Curran to receive consultancy fees from Deputy Speaker, that there are troubling instances funds. I want to mention another one as well which raises many of the same issues. There is Services, which for many years was owned shires association. In 2004 LG Financial Services Super. LG Super is the fund which has custody local government instrumentalities in government and shires association sold the there were several directors in common between and LG Super. This transaction may well have and shires association as a means of raising arises: was this transaction also in the interests the sole purpose test in section 62 of the I have argued that there are governance problems the so-called equal representation model superannuation funds, and the largest class of to be directors of industry and public sector how extensively this occurs. According to Regulation Authority, there are 71 funds industry funds. If you review, as I have, the that the total funds under management exceed governance of these funds is a matter of superannuation savings are governed, are directed and managed according to the decisions these 71 public sector funds, there were 551 directors appointed by unions and the majority were union officials. A very wide range of funds have a large number large number of union appointed directors. I Scheme, which has three union appointed directors; the Meat Industry Employees' Superannuation Fund, it was reported in The Australian, company, Austcorp. Almost all of that money Australian has reported that Mr Wally Curran, and a long-serving director on the board of fees by Austcorp. Further, according to ASIC of the Meat Industry Employees' Superannuation of several Austcorp group companies, including about whether there was a conflict of interest in a position of considerable trust, managing a of the retirement savings of low-paid blueit advance the interests of those workers for Mr Austcorp? So I would suggest to you, Madam of governance problems in superannuation does not involve union appointed directors but a company called Local Government Financial in New South Wales by the local government and was sold to the superannuation fund LG of the retirement savings of employees of New South Wales. At the time that the local company LG Financial Services to LG Super, the local government and shires association looked very attractive to the local government funds from the sale of an asset, but the question of members of LG Super? Did it comply with Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act? in the superannuation sector arising from under which directors are appointed to directors are union officials who are appointed superannuation funds. Let me turn next to discuss data issued by APRA, the Australian Prudential which APRA classifies as public sector or as annual reports of these 71 funds, you discover $380 billion. So, by any measure, the great concern to many, many Australians whose held within the custody of these funds and are made by these directors of these funds. Of in total and, of those directors, 171 were of union officials on their boards or have a could mention the Australia Post Superannuation AustralianSuper, with $47 billion under management, so an enormous fund, with six Building Unions Superannuation, Cbus, with Employees Superannuation Trust Australia, Authorities Superannuation Fund in Victoria, Government Superannuation Scheme in New State Public Sector Superannuation Scheme-and think it might be South Australia, but I appointed directors; and Sunsuper, with three make up a total of 171 union appointed directors funds. If you turn around and look at this from are involved in appointing directors, that is is that a number of major unions have their funds. I want to look, for example, at Unions different funds. The CFMEU appoints 15 directors under management, in total, $29 million. The Australian Workers' Union, has nine directors Council for Trade Unions, appoints 20 directors sector superannuation funds, which have under Voice appoints nine directors across four appoints 13 directors across six funds and CEPU, the CPSU, the ASU or the Australian Distributive and Allied Employees Union-of when I was a university student working as membership was compulsory. The USU or the Services Union, the Maritime Union of Australia unions which appoint directors to industry I think it is clear from these statistics that substantial economic power through their capacity sector superannuation funds which have billions of dollars. As I have indicated in the issues not just because it is, I argue, evidence since days of the Hawke-Keating government movement, but also because of the clear governance officials appointed to the boards of industry be tempted to exercise their economic power interests of the members of the superannuation fund. I want to turn finally to the question of looked into this question. The Cooper review funds and it recommended major changes to unions and employer organisations appointing funds. In the chapter discussing this issue, points about the flaws in the current system, superannuation funds will not be members of the union appointed directors; Construction and eight union appointed directors; HESTA, Health with seven union appointed directors; Local with four union appointed directors; the Local South Wales, with four union directors; the I am not totally sure which state this is; I would need to double-check that-with six union union appointed directors. And all of these on industry and public sector superannuation the other angle and you look at the unions which also extremely instructive, because what you find tentacles extending into a lot of superannuation NSW, which appoints nine directors to several across four funds, and those funds have alternative government of this country, the across seven funds. The ACTU, the Australian across seven different industry and public management in total over $100 billion. United separate funds. The Electrical Trades Union other unions which appoint directors include the Services Union, the SDA or the Shop which I was once a member on the basis that a shop assistant it was no-ticket-no-start and United Services Union, the HSU or the Health and the Transport Workers Union are other and public sector superannuation funds. the major unions in this country exercise very to appoint directors to industry and public funds under management totalling hundreds of first part of my remarks, this raises significant of a clear strategy pursued by the Labor Party to extend the economic influence of the union issues which arise when you have union and public sector superannuation funds who may in the interests of the union rather than in the the recommendations of the Cooper review, which looked at the governance of superannuation the existing equal representation system of directors to the boards of superannuation the Cooper review made a number of obvious including the fact that many members of union and therefore the fact that the union is appointing directors does nothing to give representation as more and more people are in the pension active employees and therefore no longer that the so-called equal representation arrangement put in place to entrench the superannuation-be fundamentally changed. completely ignored by former AWU secretary should the coalition come to power,",176

But the debate also allows us to speak building blocks and the ongoing vision From my point of view, in relation to the the electorate of Lyons in Tasmania. It has have been needing attention for many years infrastructure. I thank the government for up-to-date transit systems which take into consideration and the need we have to shift freight and people.

When you think been in the parliament a long time now-with we are trying to bring together a port and for the first time in history we are looking infrastructure needs. It is well overdue. I note which were laid off, queued up waiting because we were not dealing with infrastructure. in the nation's roads, in rail, in electricity now 42 per cent higher in real terms than during 2006-07. In part that has been driven by much we have already committed $60 billion as part the nation's road, rail and public transport infrastructure our cities need will require a also with the private sector. That is why we ways of attracting greater private investment in Labor's approach involves investing in both urban in such a balanced way, any growth in the halt by lack of basic infrastructure to service infrastructure extends well beyond the limits our regions carrying much of the nation's wealth. Two-thirds of our infrastructure budget is Australia.
