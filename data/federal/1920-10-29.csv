1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. .SPECIAL ADJOURNMENTMotion (hy Mr HUGHES), hy leave, agreed toThat the House, at, its rising, adjourn until Wednesday next, at 3 p.m. ' MEMBERS' BILL FILES'. ; Mr SPEAKER - Wit h reference to ihe request made by the honourable member for Illawarra last night, I have to say that files of all Bills. were kept in the chamber for each member for a number of years. It was found that many members did not use them, preferring to avail themselves of the copies of Bills placed on the table. Owing to the shortage of printing paper, it was arranged that fifteen files of Bills be placed in various parts of the chamber in lieu of, supplying one file to each member. This has resulted in a considerable saving in printing paper, as well as in the expense of keeping the files in pair. There,is still a serious shortage of printing paper, and every effort is made to keep the number of documents printed down to a minimum .without inconveniencing members. A file of Bills will be supplied to any member who desires to have them and notifies the Clerk accordingly. INDUSTRIAL PEACE ACT. ACTION TO TEST VALIDITY. ' Mr Charlton - I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government intend to be adequately represented by counsel in connection with the appeal against an award affecting the constitutional validity of portions of the Industrial Peace Act? M i . HUGHES-^Certainly; we shall defend the constitutionality of the Act. NA SHIPBUILDIN G CONTRACT. . Mr HUGHES (Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.4] -(B y leave.)-It will be within the knowledge of honourable members that an agreement was made between the Commonwealth Government and Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh for the building of wooden vessels. ' The firm now asks to be relieved of. its contract. Parenthetically, I may add that arrangements were entered into with Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company for the purchase of the ships. The contractors point out that they have met with considerable difficulty and unavoidable delays in the carrying out of the. work, with the result that the cost of [248]- 2 vessels to date has greatly exceeded the amount anticipated, and more has already been spent on them than they should cost when completed. Owing to its scarcity, the cost of certain classes of timber required for the skips has greatly exceeded the contractors' estimate. They say, too, that the decision of the Government to sell the vessels to Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company in anticipation of completion has resulted in complications and added to the expenditure because of extra work in the way of alterations required by the company, and the omission of the Diesel engines originally specified for has varied tha re- work, and finality has not been reached respecting the reduction which should be made in the contract price by reason, of it. There are also certain other matters in dispute - Since the first vessel was launched, a hog has developed, which in all probability will prevent {he con* tractors from obtaining a Lloyd's certificate for her, which is required by. the agreement. As matters stand, there would appear to be little chance of ar=riving *t a settlement of the various questions in dispute without entering into costly and probably unsatisfactory legal proceedings. The contractors, therefore, ask to be relieved of their contract, and that the whole matter be referred to the Public Works Committee, with a view to a report being furnished and a decision obtained as to the conditions of the release. The contractors say that they are willing to abide by the decision of the Committee whatever it may be. In all the circumstances, I think that it would be in the interests of the Commonwealth to relieve them of their contract, and, therefore, I move That the following matter be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Publie Works for investigation and reportTbe advisability of complying with the request of Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh to be relieved of the obligation to complete - the contract entered into by them, on the 4th August, 1910, to build two wooden vessels for the Commonwealth, and the conditions upon which such relief, if deemed advisable, should be granted; and that the Committee be authorized to proceed with its investigations whilst the House is sitting. I may add that I have seen the two vesthe sels, one of which is within three weeks of being ready for sea, and the other not quite so forward. It was proposed to sell them to Messrs. Burns Bhilp, and Company, but that firm required certain alterations in them, involving the expenditure of many thousands of pounds. As their demands varied from time to time, I gave them forty-eight hours to say whether they would buy the ships at the price agreed on, and as they stood, without further alterations, which they declined to do, sisting on alterations being made. These vessels will carry wheat, and also copra, and we badly want tonnage for the transport of both commodities. They can be made ready for sea within six or eight weeks. Unless we take the course that I propose, we shall have to go to law with the contractors, and I think it is better let the Public Works Committee decide the matter. The members of the Committee can be trusted to conserve the interests of the Commonwealth. As the representative of one of the parties, I think that we should be well advised to refer ithe matter to the Public Works Committee, and thus get it settled. I have taken a great deal of trouble to ascertain the facts, and to straighten things out, and strongly recommend that course. The Committee consists of members of this House and the Senate, and may be trusted to come to an expeditious and righteous decision..",19
2,Mr TUDOR,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Yarra) [11.10] - Apparently the shipbuilding that has been carried on by private enterprise within the Commonwealth has proved a failure. Honoraible members opposite have favoured private enterprise as against Government control, and some of them opposed the building of vessels at the Government yards at Cockatoo Island, Williamstown, Walsh Island, and elsewhere, saying that we could do better, and get ships built more cheaply, if we trusted to private enterprise. Now Messrs. Kid--man and Mayoh ask to be relieved of .their contract, and the Wallace Power Boat Company' have been relieved of another contract. Were I asked to choose between the course adopted in the latter case and that now proposed, I would infinitely prefer the present procedure, because everything will be done in tthe light of day. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony), in whose electorate a great deal of the shipping work has been carried out, knows more of these matters than I do, and, no doubt, will have something ito say about them. Not only has private shipbuilding failed in the Commonwealth, but the ships which we had built for us at Seattle by private firmB came to us in the condition of sieves.",21
3,Mr WATKINS,CANCELLATIO N OF,And cost more for extras than their original price.,21
4,Mr TUDOR,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Yes . The following in- members of this House and the Senate make up the Public Works Committee:Senators Foil, Newland, and Plain, and Messrs. Atkinson, Bamford, Gregory, Mackay, Mathews, and Parker Moloney; but as this is a special matter, I think it had better be referred to a special Committee, composed of members familiar to with the work to be investigated. In saying that, I in no way reflect on the ability or honour of the members of the Works Committee. Messrs.. Kidman and Mayoh say that they are willing to accept the verdict of that Committee, but possibly this House might treat the Committee's report as it has treated its report on the proposal to transfer the Notes Printing. Office from the King's Warehouse to the Victoria-parade site.",21
5,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"If you do not agree to my proposal, Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh. will say, ""As you are insisting on a second voice, we must have the same."" What is needed is finality. Without a decision in the manner I suggest, they will go to law. 'Some persons think a loit of the law.",21
6,Mr TUDOR,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I have not much admiration for the law, except as a costly institution for suitors which benefits the lawyers. The more one knows of the law the less he likes it. I think ""that there should be a special Committee to deal with this matter.",21
7,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,The suggestion of a special Committee re-opens the whole case. Whait I propose is the result of long negotiations.,21
8,Mr TUDOR,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I think that the matter should be dealt with by a special Committee. In no case should the Public Works Committee's decision be final, because its members, like other persons, are capable of making mistakes. It is a gross reflection on private enterprise that it has been unable to conduct shipbuilding satisfactorily either to those engaged in the work or to the Commonwealth.",21
9,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Dalley) [11.15] - I am somewhat favourable to having a Committee to investigate, not only the matters spoken of by the Prime Minister, but everything connected with the building of wooden ships, both here and in America. So far as referring this matter to the Public Works Committee is concerned^ I think it would be a mistake to adopt that course. It would be far better for the House to appoint a Select Committee-to deal with it. The members of the Public Works Committee already have quite a number of important questions engage ing their attention, and there are other matters which must be referred to that body in the immediate future if our public works policy is to be proceeded with. Consequently, that Committee will be loaded up with work. We must also recollect that the Public Works Committee was constituted by a special Act of Parliament for a specific purpose.",22
10,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I was just endeavouring to ascertain whether the firm which is involved in this dispute with the Commonwealth will agree to the proposal that the matter should be referred to a Select Committee. I will accept the finding of the Committee, of course. But there are other complications. We propose to refer the matter to the Public Works Committee, because that body has some legal status.",22
11,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,Has it the legal status to deal with this matter? It was appointed to inquire into specific proposals foT the expenditure of large sums of public money. That is quite a different matter from inquiring into a dispute between a private firm of contractors and the Commonwealth.,22
12,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,I would point out to the honourable member that it will be useless for us to agree to a motion for a Select Committee if the firm in question will not concur in the course which is being followed.,22
13,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that I believe the firm will agree to the course which is proposed.,22
14,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Then I have no objection. If the honourable member likes, I will accept the suggestion that the matter shall be referred to a Select ^Committee consisting of a similar number of mem-; bers of-this Parliament, as compose the Public Works Committee.",22
15,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"In my opinion, the matter is one which does not require to be investigated by a large Committee... It needs a Committee consisting of men who have some grip of it. . ..",22
16,Mr TUDOR,CANCELLATIO N OF,But.the Committee must consist of a certain number of members from another place.,22
17,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,We ought not . to rush this proposal through the House too quickly.,22
18,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"We had better stick, to a Committee of nine, composed of six members of this House and three members of another place ",22
19,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,The Prime Minister agrees that a Committee of members of Parliament shall be appointed to investigate the matter?,22
20,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,Yes .,22
21,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"That being so, I should like to know, what are to be. the functions of the Committee. Will its members be restricted, to an endeavour to make an arrangement with the firm, of Messrs. Kidman , and Mayoh, or will they have an opportunity of investigating the whole of the surrounding circumstances?'",22
22,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"The whole of the surrounding circumstances-the workmanship of the, ships, the specifications, the t i extent to,which the specifications'have been departed from, at whose instance they were, departed from, whether the vessels..' are seaworthy, their contract price, whether we ought to be bound by that, price, and, indeed, the whole thing. Mr MAHONY,-Will they also have the right to consider whether the contract for the building of - these .two weasels ought not to have been cancelled at the time the contracts-, for the construe^ tion of other vessels were cancelled?",22
23,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"No , After all,.we are endeavouring to ascertain how much the Commonwealth ought - to pay. MrMAHONY - Why is it that the Commonwealth is called upon to .pay anything? Where did the initial error take place? - ",22
24,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"There is the contract --' Mr.'MAHONY - That is the point. It may be that that was the initial error - that 'it was a mistake to enter into the contract. Upon the other hand, it ' mav be that the initial - error was in failing to cancel the contract - at the time the-contracts for the construction of-other vessels were cancelled.",22
25,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"We want a recommendation as to how much we should pay in order to get these ships. If we did^not want the vessels I would not - move my finger in lite matteT, and would allow the dispute to go to law. But we do want the vessels.",23
26,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"That is all right, so far as it goes. - Mr Wise - That is the whole issue.",23
27,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,There is more in it than that. i,23
28,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Ti e honourable, .member wants the Committee to inquire into the question of whether we ought to have ordered the vessels in the beginning Mr MA.HONY - No . But I want the Committee to inquire whether the Government should not have secured the cancellation of the contract foT the construction of these vessels when other shipbuilding contracts with this very firm of Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh were cancelled, and when the firm was paid £70,000 by way of compensation. The Government then agreed that the .building of the Burnside and' Braeside, the two vessels which form the subject of the present dispute, should be proceeded with. The Committee should be empowered to inquire why the contract for the Tmilding of these vessels was not cancelled when other shipbuilding contracts were cancelled. - Mr HUGHES - It was not cancelled, because these ships were then i-n process of construction.",23
29,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"There were Vessels in process of construction at that time by the Wallace Power Company. At Woolwich today, honourable members may see the skeletons of these vessels the contract for the construction of which was cancelled by the Government undertaking to pay that company compensation to the extent of £50,000. The Prime Minister's contention, therefore, will not hold good.",23
30,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,Very great headway had been made with the construction of the Burnside and Braeside.,23
31,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,Now ?,23
32,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"No , then. :",23
33,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"On e - of these vessels, so far as actual construction is concerned, is nearly complete. Whether she isfitto proceed to sea, is another matter. But' the Burnside was not in - being at the time of which I am speaking.",23
34,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,Why waste-more time?,23
35,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I resent that sugges- tiori by the Prime Minister. The - contract for the construction of these vessels has 'cost the Commonwealth some hundreds of thousands of pounds, and I have a right to stand - up here and talk about it. Neither the Prime Minister nor any other honourable member has a right to suggest that I am wasting time.",23
36,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,Are we not proposing t© refer the dispute to a Select Committee?,23
37,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"But I desire to see a - Committee appointed which will be empowered to investigate the matter fully. Mr HUGHES:--The honourable, member wishes to make it a political inquiry.",23
38,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I do not. The Prime Minister may appoint whoever he choosesupon the Committee. The Government have the power and the numbers to placeupon the Committee just what members they may think fit. Thia matter ought to be investigated by a Seleet Committee, and the Commonwealth ought not to be forced to go to law. Mr MdWiixiAMS - It should b« investigated by a Royal Commission, and not by a Select Committee.",23
39,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I want something more than is proposed by the Prime Minister. If the right honourable gentleman is prepared to (agree-to the appointment of a Select Committee which shall have power to conduct an inquiry upon the lines I have suggested, I have no objection to his proposal.",23
40,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,I am willing to amend my motion so as to make it provide for the appointment of - a Select Committee of seven members of this Parliamentfive from the House of Representatives and two from the Senate.,23
41,Mr TUDOR,CANCELLATIO N OF,How will the Prime Min? ister apportion representation upon the Committee ?,23
42,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,I shall not attempt to do that now. I shall do it only after consultation with the honourable member and with the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams)..,23
43,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CANCELLATIO N OF,May I suggest that a Royal Commission should be apbecause pointed instead of a Select Committee?',24
44,Mr SPEAKER,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Order ! It is alfore, most impossible for me to follow what is appointed. being said owing to the frequency of interjections and the general hum of versation.",24
45,Mr MAHOISTY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"How many members to of the Committee does the Prime Mintion. ister think should come from the Opposition side of the chamber, how many from the Government side, and how ister many from the Corner party?",24
46,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"When the actual perCommonwealth sonnel is brought here, the honourable member will be able to scrutinize it, to say whether it is satisfactory wise.",24
47,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,But in matters of this sort there is usually an arrangement made.,24
48,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I will bring along the to him. names of the members whom it is proposed to appoint, and the honourable member will then be able to say whether they shall form the Committee or not.",24
49,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"It is not a question of names, but there must be a fair representation of the different parties Parliament.",24
50,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,Will not the names show from whence the proposed of 'the Committee come ?,24
51,Mr SPEAKER,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I must ask the honCommittee orable member for Dalley to address the Chair, and not to continue a conversarestricted tion with the Prime Minister.",24
52,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I am anxious to do so, but this is a very important matter.",24
53,Mr SPEAKER,CANCELLATIO N OF,-It is not proper for have. the honourable member to carry on a private conversation with the Prime Minwe have? ister across the table.,24
54,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,Ver y well. I conmore? sider that a Select Committee should be appointed to deal with this matter,24
55,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CANCELLATIO N OF,"It should be a Royal Commission, and not a Select confer Committee.",24
56,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"That is so. I am very glad the honourable member has redesire minded me of that fact, because he and I have recently had rather an unpleasant experience of the difference between two such bodies in connection with an inquiry' which we were conducting as members of a Select Committee. We discovered that, we were a Select Committee, our powers were very limited.. I think, therethat a Royal Commission should be",24
57,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I cannot agree to that. conI brought forward this motion, but I shall withdraw it and let the matter go law if there is to be any further objec",24
58,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"If the Prime Minchooses to exhibit temper in regard to the matteT, that is 'his affair, but it will involve a loss to the country. If the has to submit to a loss of thousands of pounds merely because he and chooses to lose his temper, the Commonr or otherwealth will know what to do.",24
59,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I give way to the honourable member in everything he wants, and yet he keeps on asking for more, and more, and more. Oliver' Twist was a fool",24
60,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,Will . the Prime Minister agree to the Committee beingvested with the power for which I have been contending?,24
61,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,I will give it . all the. in this power that I can.,24
62,Mr SPEAKER,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Order ! This conversation is absolutely irregular, and' members must not be continued.",24
63,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I desire that the shall have ample powers to, inquire into this matter, and shall not be in their investigations.",24

68,Mr FLEMING,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Robertson) [11.31]..' - There is only one point to which I to refer. It seems to me that this is an inquiry which should naturally f all within the province of the Public Accounts Committee, and, that being so, I fail to: understand why the Public Works Committee should be asked to undertake it.' - Mr HUGHES - They are not now going to inquire into the matter at all.'",24
69,Mr FLEMING,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Why is it necessary to appoint a Special Committee when this House has already appointed one which should properly deal with tion? - Mr HUGHES - I saw the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (Mr. Fowler), who told me that it was busily engaged on another urgent matter. That is why it is not to go to that Committee.",25
70,Mr FLEMING,CANCELLATIO N OF,"But the inquiry on which the Public Accounts Committee is now busily engaged is not to continue definitely. Why, then, should we create Committee on Committee?",25
71,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,This is an urgent matter ,25
72,Mr FLEMING,CANCELLATIO N OF,"If this is an urgent matter, demanding immediate inquiry, shall not protest against the proposal; but ment. in bringing.it before the House, the Prime Minister, did not make it evident - that the, question was so urgent that the PubCook). lic Accounts Committee could not take it in hand. ' Mr MCWILLIAMS (Franklin) [11.34]. - To ' the suggegtion that the matter should , be. referred to a Committee inquiry there can be practically no objecwhat, tion; but, having regard to the recent experience of the Select Committee on Sea Carriage, T think a Select Committee under the Standing Orders is exceedingly restricted.' A proper inquiry into this matter can be made only by a Royal Commission.",25
73,Mr BURCHELL,CANCELLATIO N OF,In what way is a Select Committee restricted under the Standing Orders?,25
74,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CANCELLATIO N OF,"In the first construction place, it' must ""obtain the consent House to meet while the House is sitting, and must"" also secure permission from House if it desires"" to - make inquiries the' several States.' TKe greater part .this inquiry will""'uhdou'btedly take place in New South Wales, and, that being so, the proposed Select Committee will be far more hampered in its operaconducts tions-than a Royal Commission would be. A Royal. Commission would be carrying bound . by the terms: of its. comthe mission, and could not go outside them. As one who has sat on various Select Committees and Royal Commissions, I un r hesitatingly say that, in order that this matter may be thoroughly investigated, it is absolutely essential that the Committee of inquiry should have the powers of a Royal Commission. If the Govern the quesment will not accept that view",25
75,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,I do not accept it.,25
76,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Then I move That the words "" the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" Koyal Commission consisting of members of this House.""",25
77,Mr RYAN,CANCELLATIO N OF,West Sydney) [11.37] inT understood the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) to say that he would move an amendment,25
78,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CANCELLATIO N OF,I have done so.,25
79,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CANCELLATIO N OF,"And before the honourable member says another word, we I know that he will agree with the amend",25
80,Mr RYAN,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I am not going to be ""bluffed"" by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph I wish to state briefly how the matter presents itself to my mind. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) came down to the House this morning, asked . leave to move a motion without notice, of and having obtained that leave moved in my opinion, is a very important motion requiring careful consideration by honourable members. This is not a matter that can be determined by conversations across the table. It is one in which every honourable member is interested. I , for one, want to know what necessity there is for this reference to a Committee. It may be that there are sufficient reasons. Apparently the Government let a contract to Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh for the of certain ships, and Messrs. of the Kidman and Mayoh now desire to have that contract cancelled. That is what I the gather from the Prime Minister's statein ment, and he says, in effect, to the House, of "" If you do not allow this reference to a Committee which it is proposed to appoint to act as arbitrators, there must be a resort to the law."" If the Government its business properly it should not be afraid of any. law in regard to the out of a contract, provided that contract was in definite terms.",25
81,Mr STEWART,CANCELLATIO N OF,Who drew up the contract?,26
82,Mr RYAN,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I do not know; and before I shall be prepared to refer a matter of this sort to some Committee, the majority of which will consist of supporters of the Government, I shall want to know why it is necessary for the Government not to insist upon the performance of the contract, whatever it may be. Is not tha contract a definite one? If it is a definite contract, then what need can there be to refer it to a Committee? Why this rushing of the whole matter? Why all this urgency? This work has been going on for quite a long time, but the Prime Minister suddenly finds it necessary to rush in with a motion concerning a matter which I am sure not one-fourth of the members of the House fully understand. Before I agree to any motion I want to understand exactly what it is proposed to do, and why it is necessary to carry such a motion. Why should it be necessary to refer to a Select Committee the question of whether or not a particular firm shall be compelled to carry out its contract? The whole position should be clearly and definitely stated in the contract as between the Government and the contractors. That being so, I am not prepared to agree to the reference at all, until something more definite is put before the House. If there is to be a reference, then I agree with the honourable member for Franklin that it should be to some body that is clothed with ful l power to investigate the whole subject.",26
83,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CANCELLATIO N OF,It is really a Board of Arbitrators that is suggested.,26
84,Mr RYAN,CANCELLATIO N OF,Then should not the Government be able to say on what grounds they should refer the dispute to arbitration ?,26
85,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Unde r the contract, the contractors can go to arbitration on all these points, and defy us. We are entirely at their mercy. If they say they want to go to arbitration, then there must be a resort to arbitration.",26
86,Mr BRESTNAIT,CANCELLATIO N OF,Where is the contract ?,26
87,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,It is in your office. At least it should have 'been had you been alert in your business.,26
88,Mr RYAN,CANCELLATIO N OF,It is useless for the Prime Minister to joke about this matter. If the contractors have the right to refer the question to arbitration,26
89,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,They have.,26
90,Mr RYAN,CANCELLATIO N OF,Then why not refer it to arbitration ?,26
91,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,The contractors have selected this form of arbitration.,26
92,Mr RYAN,CANCELLATIO N OF,"If that is so, it is for the Government to take the responsibility of any reference, and not to come down to this House and try to shuffle the responsibility on to honourable members.",26
93,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,The honourable member is suggesting that we should go behind the back of Parliament?,26
94,Mr RYAN,CANCELLATIO N OF,"No ; but while I am a member of this House I am not going to allow the Prime Minister to shuffle on to it a responsibility which is properly that of Cabinet Ministers. The right honourable gentleman has a 'habit of doing that sort of thing. He rushes into the House, obtains leave to move a motion without notice, and shoves on to some one else's shoulders responsibilities that are properly his own.",26
95,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CANCELLATIO N OF,And if we undertook that responsibility the honourable member would say that we ought not to have done so..,26
96,Mr RYAN,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Not at all. If we accept this proposal the Prime Minister will be able to say, later on, '* I referred the matter to the 'House. This is a matter with which the Public Works Committee, the Public Accounts Committee, or some other Select Committee has dealt."" If that sort of reference is to be'made, it should be provided for before a contract is entered into. In that event, the responsibility would from the beginning rest upon the Committee. But what the Prime Minister does is - to come to the House, and to shuffle off his responsibility when he is getting into a hole.",26
97,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,We have not got into a hole.,26
98,Mr RYAN,CANCELLATIO N OF,"The right honourable gentleman tries to put on the shoulders of the Committee what is properly the responsibility of the Cabinet. In the circumstances, I take it that the Government will not rush this motion, but' will give time for its proper consideration.",26
99,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,It makes no difference to me. If the wheat-growers want ships to carry away their produce .,26
100,Mr RYAN,CANCELLATIO N OF,"More bluff! The right honourable member threatened just now to withdraw the motion.. That, too, was pure bluff. I do not care whether he withdraws it or not. There is always an excuse offering for shuffling out of Government responsibility, and covering up any particular transaction. . If there is to be an inquiry into this matter, then by all means let it be carried out by a Royal Commission. As suggested by the honourable member for Franklin, a Royal Commission would have full power to investigate the matter. I agree with that, and will support the amendment.",27
101,Mr GREGORY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Dampier) [11.43] This matter was mentioned days ago, and I understood that it was of very great urgency. I gathered that a contract had been entered into; that trouble had arisen in connection with i that a resort bo arbitration would mean indefinite delay, and that it was tremely desirable that these vessels should be available at the earliest possible ment. I was asked whether the Public ""Works Committee would undertake an inquiry, so as to be able to make a commendation to the Government.",27
102,Mr RYAN,CANCELLATIO N OF,Who approached the honmake orable member?,27
103,Mr GREGORY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"The Secretary to the Prime Minister.* So far as I know, there is no suggestion of anything that would require investigation at the hands of a Royal Commission. There nothing demanding a special investigation other than can be secured under the Statute controlling the Public Works Committee. The Committee has full power to take evidence on oath. I ordinary circumstances - the reference should undoubtedly have been to the Public Accounts Committee. That ComPublic mittee, however, is engaged upon a spearbitrator. cial investigation, which it is estimated will occupy its attention for three weeks or a month. The House was particularly anxious that the Public Accounts ComHouse, mittee should immediately undertake inquiry upon whioh it is now working. I had no desire to have anything to do with this inquiry, because I thought the questions involved were very intricate. I .was told that the matter was one of urgency, and on looking up the Public Works Committee Act I found that such a reference cleairly comes within the powers of the Committee. As Chairman, I promised that the Committee would undertake the work, though personally I had not the slightest desire for it.",27
104,Mr RYAN,CANCELLATIO N OF,Did the honourable member consult the members of the Works Committee?,27
105,Mr GREGORY,CANCELLATIO N OF,On e or two.,27
106,Mr TUDOR,CANCELLATIO N OF,The members on this side say that they were not consulted.,27
107,Mr GREGORY,CANCELLATIO N OF,I do not think the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will say that.,27
108,Mr MATHEWS,CANCELLATIO N OF,This is the first I have to me a few heard of the matter.,27
109,Mr GREGORY,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I said that if the matter was referred to the Public Works t ; Committee I , as Chairman, could see no objection to our undertaking the inquiry, exbut we had no great desire for it. The Government were very desirous of coming moto some finality so that the ships could be either disposed of or fixed up and put into commission. Eor that reason I conresented to the Committee undertaking the inquiry. If Parliament is agreeable, there is ample power for the Committee to the inquiry, provided the reference is complete enough to allow us to make every investigation. It is for the House to say whether the Committee is competent to prepare a report that will be satisfactory to Parliament, and enable is the Governmeut to carrv out whatever is determined in relation to the contra.ct.",27

111,Mr GREGORY,CANCELLATIO N OF,Do not foreet that the that Committee has power to appoint assessors; I omitted to mention that fact.,27
112,Mr MATHEWS,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Peculia r . attacks are made on members of the Works Committee, but everybody is liable to that sort'of thing, and must put up with it. Personally, I am not hankering after this job. The Works Committee already has plenty of work to do. Bui I do think that if the matter is not referred to the Public Works Committee it should be referred to the Public Accounts Committee. I can see no necessity for the appointment of a special Select Committee. If an inquiry into the whole question were desired, and there were any suggestion of something, shady in the transaction, a Royal Commission should be appointed.",27
113,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,There is nothing of that at all.,28
114,Mr MATHEWS,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I understand that the proposal is simply to appoint a Committee as arbitrator. If the House does not think that the Public Works Committee is competent to deal with the matter the inquiry should be intrusted to the Public Accounts Committee. If neither of those bodies is acceptable, Parliament should abolish both of them.",28
115,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"Bendigo-Prime Minisister and Attorney-General) [11.49] The honourable member who has j-usc resumed his seat has dealt with the matter very fairly. The points to ue settled are perfectly clear and arise out of the attempt of the contractor to contrar-t. The Government, through its departmental officers, made repeated demands for variations, additions, and alterations to the vessels, some of which the contractor said were outside the scope of the contract. The Government said they were not. The Diesel engines were taken out of the vessels, and the contractor claims an allowance for them. The Government say that he has an allowance, inasmuch as he has the engines. Still, the amount is in dispute. Then it was suggested that the ships be sold to Burns, Philp and Company for a certain price. Burns, Philp and Company asked that some alterations should be made. The contractor made the alterations at a cost of £13,000 to £15,000. Burns, Philr> and Company then asked for further alterations, and the contractor asked who would pay him for them. Thus there is a dispute between the parties as to how much is owing to the contractor. All the. Committee has to do is to arbitrate in that matter. In order to give the House anopportunity of expressing its view, I shall adhere to the motion I . submitted. If any member of the Opposition moves that the reference be to' a Select"" Committee, the honourable member for Eranklin (Mr. MCWilliams) may move to substitute a Royal - Commission. The matter can be decided in that way. If fie-House thinks that the matter should be referred to a Select Committee, I shall offer no objection, but I shall take exception to the appointment of a Royal Commission, because such a ""course would be absurd. No witnesses need be heard other than the parties themselves. We have only to appoint an arbitrator, and the whole of the information is available. All the Committee need do is to consider that information and look at the ships to see if they are seaworthy and the work done to them is worth the money that is claimed by the contractor.",28
116,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,May not we movean amendment to the motion?,28
117,Mr SPEAKER,CANCELLATIO N OF,"The Prime Minister has replied, and' it is too late for an amendment to be moved now.",28
118,Mr TUDOR,CANCELLATIO N OF,"The Prime Minister certainly gave me to understand that he would move for a Select Committee, and carry out his I accepted that.",28
119,Mr HUGHES,CANCELLATIO N OF,"That is all right, but no sooner did I accept that, than another proposal was made for the appointment of a Royal Commission. I will not agree to that.",28
120,Mr SPEAKER,CANCELLATIO N OF,"There is only one proposal before the Chair, and that is the motion to refer this matter to the Public Works Committee. If honourable members desired to substitute any other proposal, they should have moved to amend the motion according to the Standing Orders.",28

Provision has been made outside the Act for temporary treatment in institutions, such as hostels. While soldiers remain inmates of those institutions, they are not eligible; but if , in the 19 opinion of the Commissioner and the AYES. soldier himself, it would be more effective to provide a home, that may be done. No disability is placed upon the individual soldier, but each case is considered on its merits. NAVA L PRIZE MONEY.",29

As the Minister knows, I have been in conference with him on this matter, and with his knowledge put on the notice-paper a question concerning it. I now desire to ask him NOES. whether the statement appearing in the press was issued with his authority instead of being made on the floor of the , House in answer to the question which I put on the notice-paper ?",29

131,Mr RYAN,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I wish to ask the Treasurer, without notice, a question regarding the payment of pension's to the blind. In Queensland recently the minimum wage was raised for blind workers from 35s. to 40s. per week, and in consequence a reduc, j . ,. tion of 2s. 6d. per week was made in the pension payable to those workers. That is, it was reduced from 7s. fid. to 5s. per week. Will the Treasurer have the amount restored to 7 s. 6d.?",29
132,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I am glad the honourable member has brought this subject up, because it gives me an opportunity to say that the other day I received a deputation from all sides of both Houses regarding it. My inclination was then, and is still, to permit the blind pensioner, who is otherwise hale and well-hi s only disability being his blindness-to earn up to the minimum wage, including his pension. I asked honourable members who were on that deputation to ascertain if the opinion of the House would be favourable to putting through a very short measure, dealing with that subject only, without any delay. I regret to say that I have been informed that the honourable member's side of the House will not agree to an arrangement of that kind.",30

137,Mr TUDOR,CANCELLATIO N OF,"That is quite right. Some of our fellows said they would object. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - I - am surprised at the Deputy Leader of that party raising this question. He ought to know, if he does not, exactly what the position is.",30
138,Mr CONSIDINE,CANCELLATIO N OF,"The matter should be threshed out on the floor of the House, and not settled by private agreement.",30
139,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I am suggesting that it should be threshed out here; but I asked for an undertaking, to which I think I am entitled.

I am sure he was not anxious that any person should be misrepresented. - I was one of the deputation that waited on him, and I informed him that I would consult the members of my party. I did consult them. Did I not inf orm him that they said they desired to obtain the same treatment for invalid pensioners in certain cases as was proposed for the blind, and to amend the Bill in that way, not that they were going to overload it with amendments ?",30
142,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CANCELLATIO N OF,It is quite true that the honourable member did tell me that members,30
143,Mr MAHONY,CANCELLATIO N OF,Then why did you not say so ?,30
144,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CANCELLATIO N OF,"I did say so. I said distinctly that I had been informed that they would not give this simple Pill a clear passage, but intended to load it with other amendments, opening up new ground. That is the statement. I made, and that now receives confirmation at the hands of the Leader of the Opposition.",30

On which Mr Charlton had by way of amendment That the following words be added :- "" or erection of buildings at Canberra, New .South Wales.""",33
180,Mr MAHONY,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"I desire to take your ruling, Mr Speaker, as to whether this matter is properly before the House. It came before us first by way of notice of motion, and was being discussed as a motion, when the debate was interrupted understanding order 119. It is more corroct to say that an honourable member moved the adjournment of the debate on the motion- a debate on a motion, not on an Order of the Day. . This motion, however, now appears on the notice-paper as an Order of the Day. What is an Order of the Day? Standing order 147 saysAn Order of the Day is a Bill or other matter which the House has ordered to be taken into consideration on a particular day. A matter can only be made a.n Order of the Day by permission of the House; that is laid down definitely. The Government or a Minister cannot, of his own volition, place a matter on the notice paper as an Order of the Day without first asking the leave of the House. If the House grant leave, the business can be placed on the notice-paper as an Order of the Day in whatever position the Government may think fit. But in this case the adjournment of the debate was moved by an honourable member; no permission has been given by the House for it to be made an Order of the Day. I therefore, ask your ruling, sir, as to whether it can appear on the notice paper as an Order of the Day.",33
181,Mr SPEAKER,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT, I think the honourable member is mistaken when he says that this motion was interrupted understanding order 119.,33

186,Mr SPEAKER,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"The mo.tion, as the Minister says, was that the business be made an Order of the Day for a later hour of the day.",33

188,Mr ROBERT COOK,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"Indi ) [12.21] I listened with deep interest to the debate on this motion for the extension of the Geelong Woollen Mills. The amount required for«the work is small; and, in view of the fact that we already have at Geelong the necessary land, buildings, and plant, the proposal of the Government is judicious, more particularly when we take into consideration the great shortage in supplies, and that those supplies can be increased very considerably by means of this project. Under the circumstances the motion shall have my support. It is generally supposed that there are three parties in this House, but if the discussion on this motion be any indication, it would appear that there are at least seventy-five parties, each member, apparently, being desirous to have woollen mills erected in his constituency at the cost of the Commonwealth.",33
189,Mr JAMES PAGE,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,Her e is one that does not desire such a thing.,34
190,Dr EARLE PAGE,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,And here is another.,34
191,Mr ROBERT COOK,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"Then I must make an exception of those two honourable members. What would it cost the country if the various members who have spoken on this motion had their requests granted? I venture to say that to equip a mill, equal in every particular to the existing Commonwealth Woollen M ill , would cost, at the present time, at least £500,000.",34
192,Mr RILEY,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,Who told you that? You are not dealing with butter now; this a matter of which you know nothing.,34
193,Mr ROBERT COOK,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"Possibl y the facts I am relating are strange to the honourable member, but, however that may be, I intend to deal only with facts. There seems to be a desire on the part of honourable members for sole Government control of the woollen business; but such proposal shall have my support. It sired, and is offered. is recognised that there are great openings for this industry in Australia, but what is required for its development is the couragement of co-operative effort and private enterprise. No doubt Governindeed, ment assistance, both State and Federal, is necessary. B y that I mean that i probable the Commonwealth may have finance the States, but it is for each istic Government venture. State to finance such industries w it boundaries. In different parts of the much opposed to Commonwealth there are several proI posals for the establishment of woollen mills; quite a number of companies are on the verge of flotation, and in my constituency at least two are ready for registration. Those concerned in these enterprises do not desire any "" spoon-feeding,"" nor, indeed, any assistance without offering tangible security. The feeling in my district, and I trust in other districts also, is that those immediately concerned should find as much of the necessary capital as possible, say 50 per cent., the balance to be advanced by the Government on first class security. There is no idea of raiding the Treasury in any shape or for m ; they ask for no advances which they do not intend to repay. All they desire is, as I say, some assistance on good security. In my opinion it will be many years before the necessary labour for a woollen m i ll could be obtained in the Federal area. If the Government have money to spend in this direction, their wisest course would be to wait until the housing and general conditions in that part of Australia are more congenial; at present, I regard the amendment as outside practical consideration. As to the woollen industry generally, I have collected some information from the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, of which Mr Stirling Taylor is the Director. We are told that the establishis ment of this industry must have many advantages for young Australia. This country, we are told, should not only grow wool, but should manufacture it , at least, to such an extent that the Australian people may be clothed with Australian-made woollen goods, the m.akinsr some of which would find employment and wages for Australian workmen, and for no other population which is so much deI t is generally agreed that we require population; and, taking into consideration that we are such enan extensive wool-producing country, the wool industry offers great opportunities, for a most desirable class of immigrant. Quite a number of people are t is of opinion that the Bureau is desirous to that there shall be a huge socialThat is h in its not so; and, I , for one, am very any such idea. n reference to the proposal that the industry should be under Government control, the view is expressed by the Bureau that it is essential that the development of the manufacture of woollen goods should be left entirely in the hands of private enterprise, backed up, of course, by any reasonable financial assistance the Government are prepared to give. In my opinion, this is the safest and most economical way of carrying on the industry. At the present time, it is pointed out, the'output of woollen and worsted goods from Australia is only 15 per cent, of the requirements of the Commonwealth, which is a shocking state of affairs, taking into consideration the fact that Australia produces something like one-fifth of the world's supply of wool. It is estimated by the Bureau that £14,000,000 would be required during the next ten or fifteen years to establish complete up-to-date woollen mills in each State. Seeing that the British-Australian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited has a capital of £5,500,000, Howard Smith Proprietary Limited a capital of £5,000,000, and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company a capital of £4,000,000, the three companies having a total capital of £14,500,000, there ought not to be any difficulty in raising sufficient money to establish the manufacture of woollen goods in each State, particularly when we realise that even to meet the present requirements of the population would necessitate the treatment of at least 2,000,0*00 lbs. of greasy wool per annum. The suggestion of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry is that a company should be formed in each State on the basis of the wool produced within the State, and it is estimated that the capital required to finance the scheme would be approximately £5,000,000 for New South Wales, £3,000,000 for Victoria, £2,000,000 for Queensland, £1,000,000 for South Australia, £1,000,000 for Western Australia, and £250,000 for Tasmania. The best indication that the development of the industry would prove profitable is the fact that our existing mills do not produce more than 15 per cent, of our requirements; but there is no doubt an enormous increase in population would follow, and that a great impetus would be given to the development of kindred industries, such as fertilizers, Mr Robert Cook. tallow, candles, soap, glue, tanning, leather, boot3, bags, harness, building motors, and electrical. There would also be an increased demand for food products. All this expansion which would follow would certainly justify the amount of expenditure involved. 1 would be very sorry to see the woollen industry nationalized, and the scheme suggested by the Bureau of Science and Industry is not on those lines. An attempt to nationalize it would not only deliver a serious blow at private enterprise, but also retard the development of the Commonwealth considerably. I trust that honourable members who are anxious to promote the establishment of the manufacture of woollen goods will consult Mr Stirling Taylor, the Director of the Bureau of Commerce and In dustry, because he has the latest data on the subject collected from all parts. His information is thoroughly reliable, and beyond contradiction, and if honorablo members would avail themselves of his advice, they would find it most valuable. In conclusion, I trust that the woollen industry will be developed, not only in the interests of the wool-grower or the consumer, but also in the interests of the general welfare of Australia.",34
194,Mr BRUCE,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"Flinders) [12.35] - As, apparently, one will be obliged to record a vote upon this proposal, and also upon the locality where the expenditure is to take place, I want to say a few words with regard to the whole question. I am in favour of the money being spent at Geelong in extending the woollen mills already there; but, during this debate, I have suffered more shocks than I have ever experienced in the House previously. For instance, many honourable members who have strenuously advocated that this money, and possibly more, should be spent in their own electorate on this State enterprise are gentlemen who, when candidates, spoke upon every platform against any form of State enterprise or State industry. Generally speaking, I am opposed to State control of ventures of this nature; but I hold a rather different view in regard to the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, because they have been in operation, and in the past have served a very useful purpose, and I , therefore, am prepared to vote in favour of spending this money at Geelong in extending existing mills. I am perfectly certain that if the money were to be spent in establishing another mill in another part of the Commonwealth, it would only be a prelude to the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds more, because woollen mills cannot be erected and run nowadays at anything like the figure set down as the estimated cost of this extension of existing mills, and it would mean the creation of a new administrative and governing body for the conduct of the work. As that would be a very serious proposition to consider, I am perfectly clear upon the point that if money is to be spent in this direction, the only purpose for which it should be spent is in extending existing mills.. While I am prepared to accept a proposal to extend an existing State enterprise, I think some more efficient system of control should be applied to it. At present, the Geelong Woollen Mills are controlled by a Commonwealth Department, through a manager. .Is there one honourable member who would be prepared to hand over his own money to the manager of a concern over whom he would have no efficient control, or against whom he would have no protection so far as his interests or rights were concerned?",35
195,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,A regulation has jus: been gazetted for the appointment of a Board to look after the enterprises which are conducted by the Defence Department.,36
196,Mr BRUCE,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"I have not seen that regulation; but if that is the case, it is certainly a great advance I welcome it most heartily, because it is essential that there should be a Board of this nature, such as exists in every other industry, to control general policy, and really act as controller over the manager. Necessarily, the manager is obliged to devote a great deal of his time to details, and to the technical running of the enterprise, and he certainly ought to hnve some one to assist him, preferably a Board such' as I am informed it is now. proposed to create. The enterprise would then be more carefully and .seriously criticised; in fact, would be given, that consideration which a private individual exercises in respect to the investment of his own money. In any case the proposed Board ought to give careful attention to the production of a commercial balance-sheet in respect to its venture, just as any individual business man is obliged to do.",36
197,Mr GREGORY,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,I have been asking for. that for the last three years.,36
198,Mr BRUCE,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"I have heard that statement previously from the honourable member, and it seems to me it is a matter that should be pressed for. It is not a question of whether State enterprise is right or wrong, but is a question of applying ordinary business-like methods to Government undertakings. Even those who are enthusiastically in favour of the State embarking upon such ventures should be most insistent in pressing for these balance-sheets, because if we have not each year that supervision which is suggested by the requirement to produce annual balance-sheets and trading accounts, indicating the position of an industry, it will only be a matter of time for inefficiency to creep in and for charges and costs to rise above those of outside enterprises; and then the whole idea of State enterprise would be damned. I am prepared to vote for this further money being spent in extending existing woollen mills, but not in the creation of a new plant in some other part of the Commonwealth. In casting my vote in this way I am not to be taken as being enthusiastically in favour of the State control of enterprise. Such is not the case.",36
199,Mr JACESON,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"Bass) [12.43] - The most entertaining couple of hours the House has had this session was experienced the other afternoon when the Minister (Mr Groom) submitted this motion. Practically every honourable member who spoke asked that money should be spent upon mills in his own electorate. As thisis not a proposition to erect new mills, but is simply a project to spend £60,000 in the extension of an existing plant, I shall support the proposal of the Minister, and, of course, vote against the amendment.",36
200,Mr RILEY,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,Why confine the Public Works. Committee to one particular locality?,36
201,Mr JACESON,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"Because it is deemed absolutely necessary to extend the-present mills. A proposition to erect new mills would be an entirely different proposition. If sucb a project were put forward, I would immediately advance the claims of Launceston, which, when Geelong was selected as the site of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, was the Committee's second choice.",36
202,Mr ATKINSON,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,In reality Launceston was its first choice.,37
203,Mr JACKSON,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"Well , I am prepared to accept the verdict of the Committee which chose Geelong after inspecting no fewer than thirty-three possible sites throughout Australia.",37
204,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,Why does the honourable member say Launceston was the second site favoured ? Did Mr Smail say so ?,37
205,Mr JACESON,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"Yes . For the benefit of honourable members who take a delight in despising the little island, I would remind them that we have ample industrial power available, and are not dependent upon coal supplies. We have the water power, and it has already been availed of as a great asset; but it will become far more so in the future. Industries are being conducted upon a very big scale. There is, for example, the Electrolytic Zinc Company, in Hobart, which employs 1,000 hands. That is an entirely new industry. Cadbury's and other world-famed firms have inaugurated extensive factories also. With respect to the suitability of Launceston as a site foT Departments. Commonwealth - woollen mills, this fact should be sufficient, namely, that Messrs. Kelsall and Kemp, of Yorkshire, who are among the largest manufacturers in the world, are now erecting woollen mills at Launceston, involving an expenditure of £200,000 upon plant, machinery, and buildings.",37
206,Mr RILEY,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,But you have no coal there.,37
207,Mr JACESON,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"We do not need coal. Our industries are freed from coal troubles. Despite all the strikes and the shipping hold-ups of the past few years, never once has the electric energy been turned off in Tasmania. I am pleased to hear so many honourable members advocating the claims of Australian industries, and I trust that the motion will be agreed to.",37
208,Mr CHARLTON,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"I desire to amend my amendment by leaving out all the words after "" or,"" with a view to inserting, in lieu thereof, the wordsAlternatively, the erection of suitable woollen mills at Canberra, New South Wales. Amendment amended accordingly.",37
209,Mr GROOM,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [12.52] I wish to inform the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruoe), who desired certain information, that duly accredited balance-sheets of these factories are presented to Parliament, and are open to examination; and that, in addition, a Board of Control has been established. As regards the motion itself, it should be clearly understood that it is for additions and extensions to the existing mills at Geelong. The Government have no intention of entering upon a general policy of establishing mills all over the Commonwealth to engage in private enterprise. There is nothing in the motion to suggest that. Much of the debate, while it has been informative, has been scarcely relevant. The need for the motion was due to the fact that .the Government undertook to supply returned soldiers with a quantity of material. Being well stocked with equipment after the war, the factory at Geelong has not been solely employed upon the needs of the Navy, the Defence, and the Postal As much of its capacity as possible has been devoted to supplying requirements of returned men. Something like 480,000 yards of material is still to be supplied to the soldiers, and there are growing needs in respect of our own services. To deal with that problem, and to do justice at the same time to returned soldiers, it is essential that the works be extended. This extension will be very much more economical than if we were to attempt to start fresh works at other places.",37
210,Mr RILEY,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,How long will the Government continue to supply solely to returned soldiers?,37
211,Mr GROOM,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"That is a matter of policy for the future. I am dealing with present needs. The question of where the factory ought to be established was settled when Mr Smail was appointed to travel all over the Commonwealth in the search for sites. He made a fair and impartial report, covering thirty-three sites; and, of these, he chose Geelong. His selection does not mean that Geelong is the only place in Australia where first-class materials can he manufactured; but, in the best interests of the Commonwealth, he decided upon Geelong. The additions are absolutely essential; and it is, of course, cheaper to build additions than to construct a new factory somewhere else, however suitable may be the site. At Geelong the land has been acquired, the power is available, and the administrative organization is complete. The additions merely involve an extension of a going ooncietrn. If we were to begin again somewhere else, serious delay would be incurred; and, besides, there would be the factor of all the initial costs having to be met afresh. With regard to erecting a factory at Canberra, Mr Smail's report is phrased favourably. He saysMy first visit was to Yass-Canberra, the site of the Federal city, embracing from Queanbeyan to the junction of the Cotter River with the Murrumbidgee, Duntroon, and Acton. Although the climatic conditions arc not up to my idea of the requirements it would be quite wrong to say that a woollen'factory could not be established there, because, with the development of the city, it is certain of all descriptions, and, no doubt, conditions will then prevail whereby cloth manufacture could be fairly successfully accomplished. We are faced, not with a future programme, but with a present need. I do not wish to anticipate the judgment of the Public Works Committee, but the House should authorize the inquiry, and I am not prepared to accept the amendment.

219,Mr SPEAKER,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"No ; the point of order had been taken, I think, on a previous occasion, and in the case of the motion for the appointment of the Sea Carriage Select Committee, the established practice was being followed, in pursuance of a ruling given by my predecessor. I am merely relating the procedure on an occasion subsequent to the ruling referred to-the last time, I believe, that a similar position arose. The practice was thus established to give honourable members a chance to have their motions dealt with, rather than have them arbitrarily expunged from the paper.

It gives Empire naturalization.",41
236,Mr BRENNAN,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"That is so, and to that extent it is an improvement on what we have had before. But I point out to the Minister that naturalization is a matter upon which we have necessarily more or less been bound up with Empire laws and reciprocal laws of other nations, and it is in that aspect rather than from the point of view that this is an Empire measure that we have been asked not to interfere with the status of women. I propose later on to move for the insertion of a new clause, and to register my view in this matter, which will provide that no woman born in Australia shall become an alien or forfeit her nationality by reason of her marriage with whomsoever it may take place. It may be that if we carry it - which, of course, we shall not - this part of the definition which refers to married women will be meaningless.  that character were carried, we would have to re-draft the whole Bill, and make the necessary amendments to give effect to it . - Mr TUDOR - It would be much better to strike out the words ""the status of married women or"".

That will bring the period of probation back to what it was under the existing law. We are providing in this Bill for very drastic and absolute powers of revocation in granting letters of naturalization. If we take that unlimited power of revocation, and read it with the fact that a person is to be domiciled in this country for not less than five years before he obtains his letters of naturalization, it seems that we shall be creating conditions so uncertain and precarious that no self-respecting man will settle here. I would not go to a country and attempt to make myself a useful citizen if I were told that I had for five years to remain unprotected by any citizen rights at all, with all the dangers that are involved in alienage in case of war or international disturbances of that character. If it is right, which I do not admit, that this unlimited power of granting or withholding should rest with the Minister representing the Crown, I contend more strongly still that it is not right that a person should have to live in a country unprotected by nationality in that country foT not less than five years. If we agree to this we shall be discouraging desirable men from coming to this country, and will be assuring them that they will have no protection as citizens in the country which they adopt. It is a churlish and niggardly, way of treating people who may desire to come to the Commonwealth, and it is not likely to encourage immigration. Well informed thinkers are abundantly satisfied that if we aTe to populate Australia we must make up our minds that we cannot hope to rely solely upon members of the British race. Our past history shows that the increase from overseas, and our natural increase, is inadequate, and that it is preposterous to throw difficulties in the way of populating a country equal in size to that of Europe. I am not aware, even in the light of prejudices arising from the war, that-we have given citizenship to any appreciable extent to undesirable persons. On the contrary, persons we have enlisted, by virtue of our laws of naturalization, in the majority of cases have turned out to be useful and law-abiding citizens. In these circumstances, I think that we are taking a retrograde step by increasing the period that a person must serve by way of probation before he can become naturalized, and I trust my amendment will - have the support of the Committee.

MrBAMFORD (Herbert) [2.46] - I can quite sympathize with the solicitude of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) in his endeavour to liberalize the measure. But to my knowledge, a great many Germans have not valued the privilege Of naturalization. I have known such persons to enjoy foT years the benefits conferred by our laws without troubling to apply for naturalization until they required an old-age pension, or a land transfer, or something that they could not get without being naturalizedOur naturalization law has been, in my opinion, too liberal in comparison with those of other countries.  more immigrants than America, and there an alien cannot he naturalized until he has been a resident for five years.",42

251,Mr BAMFORD,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"It was one of the causes, together with the refusal of Kruger to allow the compound system in the Transvaal which existed at Kimberley. There are many Germans still in Australia who have not taken out certificates of naturalization. While I sympathize with the desire for liberality, I do not think it in the best interests of the country to shorten the term of residence.",43
252,Mr GABB,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"Angas) [2.4S] - There are other reasons besides want of interest that have prevented many Germans from becoming naturalized. Cases have been brought under my notice in which Germans have paid to secure naturalization, but have been swindled through their ignorance of our language and our law.",43

254,Mr GABB,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"Then , many persons believed that the law of South Australia is. the same as that of the other States, and that they were naturalized by virtue of the naturalization of their parents.

255,Mr BRENDAN,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"After all, what difficulty is created? It seems to me that there is only the desire to copy British precedent. MrGABB - Reciprocity , I understand, is to be obtained only under certain conditions, and one of them is that our law shall be similar to that of the countries with which we reciprocate. When the Passports Bill was before the Committee recently, I moved an amendment to increase the life of a passport from two to five years, but that was defeated. Now, a foreigner's passport is valid for two years only, so that if he remains longer than that in this country he cannot return to his own, even though he may not have been naturalized here, and he cannot be naturalized here until he has lived in Australia for five years. I think that the term of residence required for naturalization should be the same as that for which a passport is valid. I wish to know whether the Government intends to deal in the same way with all aliens, whether they have been at war with us or not.",43

258,Mr TUDOR,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"The same conditions apply to Belgians and Frenchmen as apply to Germans. Mr GA'BB- A person of German origin who wishes to be naturalized must have twenty years' continuous residence in Australia, and unless there are special circumstances must not be under fifty years of age, it being held that younger men must be regarded as' dangerous. Younger men cannot be naturalized unless they or their brothers served on our side during the war, or their parents gave large donations to patriotic funds, or showed their patriotism in some other way. I hope that all aliens will be put on the same footing.  Home and Territories) [2.54] - At the present time there are restrictions on the naturalization of aliens belonging to the nations with which we have recently been at war. When I took office, such persons could not be naturalized without Cabinet approval in each individual case; but I suggested that, subject to good behaviour and character, persons of a certain age, and with a certain length of residence, might be allowed to be naturalized without the reference of their cases to the Cabinet; and that being agreed to, I have authorized quite a large number of naturalizations. There is no doubt that, in the very near future, a further variation will be made in the term so as to permit of the naturalization of aliens within Australia. When once this Bill has been disposed of, I intend to put the Government whether we ought not to treat all aliens upon their merits.",43
259,Mr JAMES PAGE,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"The Minister is now referring to aliens within Australia?  is rather a remarkable circumstance that although many of these men had resided in Australia for years, and had had every opportunity to become naturalized, they did not attempt to take advantage of their opportunities until after the break of war.",44

It is quite true that this would necessitate the issue of two classes of certificates. The first class of certificate would enable an alien to become naturalized within the Australia after a two years' residence five here. Then, when he had completed a residence of five years in the Commonwealth, he would be able to make an apfor a certificate of naturalization which would cover the entire British the Empire. In that way, we could obviate any conflict between this measure and Imperial legislation. I think, therefore, certhat the amendment might well be agreed There are many things which have to be considered in dealing with a measure of this character, because to a large extent its provisions will govern the Refuture of all aliens in our midst.",44

The adoption of such an amendment would improve the Bill, and would, I think, meet the wishes of the Committee generally. The difficulty which the honourable gentleman has urged°in regard to the issue of two classes of certificates is not an insuperable one. The Department could have two sets of certificates. A certificate of naturalization in respect of Australia could be issued to a person who had resided here for two years, and at the end of the five years' period that certificate could be withdrawn if desired, and a certificate of Empire naturalization issued. This, I think, is a very fair proposal, and I hope the Minister will agree to it.",44
269,Mr RYAN,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"West Sydney) [3.6] - I have pleasure in supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for' Batman (Mr Brennan) to omit the word "" five,"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" two."" I also support the contention that has been advanced by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton). This is a matter to which I referred last evening when speaking on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. It is admitted by the Minister (Mr. Poynton) that this measure will take away the right of those who are not British subjects to become naturalized under the existing law ,on a residence of two years in Australia. Tinder this Bill a man will not be able to secure naturalization except on a residence of five years.  case in Australia that would be adversely affected by this provision as to five years' r?sidence.",45
270,Mr RYAN,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"It will not prejudice those who have been residing here for at least five years; but in regard to those who come here in the future the whole policy of the Government in regard to immigration is affected by this proposal. At the present time a person who is not a British subject, on coming here from abroad, may become naturalized after a residence of two years. The Commonwealth for quite a number of years has thought that to be a sufficient residence. There is' nothing in our experience to show that such a policy was wrong. On the contrary, I think most of those who have become naturalized in Australia have proved, as the honourable member for Batman says, to be very useful citizens. In so far as naturalization in Australia is concerned, why should we depart from a policy which we deliberately adopted at the beginning of Federation, and have found to work out usefully? The only reason advanced for the change is that it is suggested that our naturalization should be Empire wide. That could be secured, as the honourable member for Hunter says, by allowing those who become naturalized in Australia to make application, after five years' residence if they so desire, for Empire-wide naturalization. But why should we, a self-governing Dominion, depart from what we have found to be the right policy for Australia? We are departing from it in regard only to those who have been our Allies in the recent war, because clause 7 provides that the Governor General may naturalize them if they have been resident in the Dominions for five years. If they have not been he will have no power to naturalize them. In addition to that, he may refuse to naturalize them, and the Minister has admitted that he does not propose to naturalize, even after a residence of five years, persons coming from countries which were recently at war with 1 Great Britain.  such persons cannot come here.",45
271,Mr RYAN,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"Some of them are already here, yet the Minister tells us deliberately that he does not intend to naturalize them after five years' residence. ",45
272,Mr RYAN,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"The honourable gentleman has admitted that the policy of the Government at the present time is not to admit to naturalization persons from countries which were recently at war with the British Empire, even if they have five years' residence.  that. What I have said is that every case will have to go before the Cabinet.",45
273,Mr RYAN,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"But surely the Government has some policy in regard to the matter. Has not the Cabinet a policy? If it has, we ought to know what it is.  apparently the honourable member was not listening.",45
274,Mr RYAN,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"I listened carefully to the honourable gentleman, and heard him say that, shortly put, each case would be dealt with on its merits. I should think every case would be so dealt with.  that. Mr Ryan"" - But I heard the honourable gentleman make that statement.  ber misunderstood me.",45
275,Mr RYAN,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,'Then will the honourable gentleman be good enough to let me know what residence in Australia will be necessary to die naturalization of persons from a country which has been at war with the Empire.  the honourable member.,46
276,Mr RYAN,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"The Minister says that I misunderstood him. Surely he will again give me the information. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) has said that twenty years' residence will be required, and that the applicant must be fifty years of age. That is not denied. What I am arguing is that in the administration of the measure this clause, requiring, as it does, five years' residence, will apply only to those who were our Allies in the recent war, or to citizens of countries that were not at war with us. In respect of all such persons, so far as our own Dominion is concerned, we ought to be able to allow the law to stand as it is, and to permit them to become naturalized after two years' residence here. I am not going to consent to the Government's proposal. They may, and probably will, pass it without my consent; but I am not going to assist in placing obstacles in the way of French and American citizens becoming naturalized on the same terms as were open to them before the war. That is contrary to international sentiment, and certainly contrary to the spirit that should exist between those who fought side by side in the recent war. Here we tell the people of such countries that we are going to set up a barrier against them, and that we are not going to admit them to citizenship on the terms on which they were admitted before the war. The position in regard to Empire naturalization is different. If the Imperial Parliament thinks that there should be a longer residence in order to secure Empire-wide naturalization, that is its right, and I am not questioning it. But it is our admitted right--^Jrea t Britain does not challenge it-to say that, so far as Australia is concerned, after a residence of say two years or such other period as we decide upon, a person may become naturalized under our law, and be entitled to the ful l rights of citizenship. For these reasons I am supporting the amendment, and I agree with the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) that the Minister, with the assistance of his officers, could easily so amend this clause as to enable Australian naturalization to be given on the existing conditions, and Empire naturalization on the condition of five years' residence, which the Imperial Parliament itself lays down in its Naturalization Act.",46
277,Mr MCGRATH,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"Ballarat) [3.13] - I  agree to the amendment, which is in no wise contrary to the uniformity of practice which he desires to insure. There is no reason why he should not insert in the Bill a clause providing for a residence of five years to qualify for Empire naturalization, and continue the existing law with respect to two years' residence qualifying for citizenship in Australia.  duplicate certificates scattered all over the country. There are many misapprehensions under the existing system, and these would be multiplied.",46
278,Mr MCGRATH,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"There is no reason why there should be any misapprehension on the subject. I do not think we ought necessarily to copy word for word a provision in a British Act. We want uniformity in mining legislation, but are we to secure it at the price of accepting all the Tory ideas of Great Britain? Because the Imperial Parliament has provided for a residence of five years in order to qualify for naturalization in the United Kingdom, I fail to see why we should make the same error in regard to Australian citizenship. During the war we had thousands of Australian soldiers in France, and many of the friends they made there are anxious to come to Australia. Our troops also made friends in Belgium and Italy. These people were told that they could secure naturalization after two years' residence in Australia, but if this Bill be passed, they will find, on coming here, that they are to be treated as foreigners until they have resided in Australia for five years. A lot of ill-feeling has been aroused in connection with this matter of naturalization. Many Italians who came out here before the war thought they would find safety under the British flag, and they found, to their dismay, that the Australian Government permitted them to be conscripted, and their wives and children to be starved. Those men were taken from Broken Hill and other parts of Australia at a moment's notice. facts are fairly generally known throughout the world. Whilst the Government are crying out for immigrants, they propose to take away from those who have already arrived in Australia one of the rights which new arrivals had prior to the war, namely, to be naturalized after a residence of two years. I cannot vote to make naturalization more difficult. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr. Bamford) spoke of the persons who had not been naturalized', although they had been in the country many years, and only sought naturalization when they desired to qualify for an old-age pension. I admit there is a good deal of truth in that statement; but the honourable member must know that most foreigners have to go to a lawyer to become naturalized, and the process often costs a good deal of money. It is generally because of ignorance that people do not become naturalized. We are anxious to get more immigrants, and the Government propose to spend thousands of pounds per annum in sending back to Europe, as immigration agents, young men who recently arrived in Australia. The best immigrants we can get are from Northern Europe, whether they be Danes, Scandinavians, or Germans. It is not long since Australian Ministers of the Crown went to Germany and urged the people there to emigrate to Australia. A good deal of the people's money was spent in connection with that propaganda.",46

280,Mr MCGRATH,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"I wish the immigrant to feel, when he arrives here, he is at home, and that he may enjoy the full rights of citizenship as soon as possible. For that reason I support the amendment.",47

The consequence is that the immigrants who are likely to come here Those will not be such as will get any sympathy from me if they have to wait for five years in order to get the inestimable boon of becoming British citizens.

290,Mr CONSIDINE,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"I am glad the that honourable member has grasped my viewpoint.

307,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,EXTENSIO N TO BUILDINGS AND EQUIPME NT,"Illawarra) [3.46] - I wish to draw attention to an important matter that may probably come up for consideration at the next Premiers' Conference. I refer to the establishment of a uniform railway gauge throughout the Commonwealth. There are a great many difficulties surrounding this question which are now being dealt with by the engineering experts of the various railway systems, hut I have not been able to ascertain whether consideration has been given to the possibility of linking up the coastal railways of Victoria and New South Wales, which would afford the readiest and cheapest means of securing a standard gauge at the earliest date between Melbourne and Brisbane. I am informed that an expenditure of about £3,500,000 would fill the gaps in the coastal system of the three States, between Brisbane and Melbourne. These are lines which must necessarily he constructed before very long, and the amount of expenditure involved would be but a small fraction of what will eventually be required for the purpose of unifying the gauges of the lines at present being operated between the two capitals.",50
