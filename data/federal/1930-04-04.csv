2,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,Severa l weeks ago I asked the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) for certain data in regard to the light dues collected by the Commonwealth and he promised to obtain the information for me. Is he able to say wheu the particulars will be available?,11
3,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"I shall have inquiries made as to whether the information is available and let the honourable member know without delay. MEMBER'S ATTENDANCE. Mr Lazzarini,- I desire to make a personal explanation. The Votes and Proceedings of this House for Wednesday, 2nd April, do not show me as having been present during any part of the sitting. I waB in my place for a few minutes in the afternoon, but had to leave to attend the meeting of a committee which kept me' occupied for the remainder of the afternoon. I was in my place in the chamber for a long period during the night sitting - in fact, for most of it. I do not know who is responsible for the preparation of the attendance record, but more care should be exercised to see that members who are in attendance have their attendance marked. I hope that this error will be rectified.",11
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I assure the honourable member that the correction will he made. NA SURCHARGE ON IMPORTS. BAJSBSD WERE - PMCES .,11
5,Mr GULLETT,PROHIBITI ON OP AN D,"Yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) invited honourable members to make constructive and helpful suggestions in regard to the prohibition of certain imports and the surcharge on others.' During the debate the suggestion was made - that a time limit should be fixed for the operation of both the proclamation and the surcharge. In considering that point, will the Prime Minister bear in mind that if anything is to be done it must be done immediately, otherwise an embarrassing position will be created ?",11
6,Mr SCULLIN,PROHIBITI ON OP AN D,"The Government gave very serious consideration to the imposition of a time limit; but it involves many practical difficulties. I cannot seo that it is urgent that an immediate decision should be made, but the suggestion will be fully and frankly discussed when we are considering the whole matter later in the session.",11
7,Mr LATHAM,PROHIBITI ON OP AN D,Yesterday afternoqp the Prime Minister intimated that it was proposed to prohibit the importation of certain goods and to ration certain other imports. The list of goods in the prothe clamation made available to honourable members this morning does not draw any distinction bet-ween the goods prohibited and those which will be rationed. Will the Prime Minister give me some in that formation on that point?,11
8,Mr SCULLIN,PROHIBITI ON OP AN D,"The proclamation includes the whole of the items which will' taction and free trade. be affected by the prohibition or rationing policy. The items to be rationed are last 11 on the list, from "" Ale and other Beer,"" down to ""Locomotives "" ; but ditions may arise from time to time which will necessitate the Minister for Trade and Custom's exercising his power to admit other items. The importation of all the items listed in the proclamation, except , the concluding 11, should, in opinion of the Government, be totally prohibited, unless under exceptional cumstances. The 11 items, we consider, should be rationed up to 50 per cent.",12
9,Mr BAYLEY,PROHIBITI ON OP AN D,May the number be augmented at any time?,12
10,Mr SCULLIN,PROHIBITI ON OP AN D,Yes ; it may be intend creased or decreased.,12
11,Mr LATHAM,PROHIBITI ON OP AN D,"Will the Prime tioned, Minister consider the advisability making an announcement to the public of the distinction that he has drawn way that will make the information available to them than the statement has just made ?",12
12,Mr SCULLIN,PROHIBITI ON OP AN D,The request is reasonthis able. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs has made a statement to press this morning in which he has indicated the distinction between 'the hibited and the rationed goods. I shall endeavour to obtain copies bf it for orable members.,12
13,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITI ON OP AN D,"I notice that barbed wire is in the list of prohibited goods. Large quantities of barbed wire are used in the new settlements of ern Australia. As the Prime Minister intimated yesterday that consideration would be given to the cost of the profind hibited articles, will ho instruct the Board to make an inquiry as speedily possible into the Australian price barbed wire to ascertain why it is almost 100 per cent, above the price in United States of America?",12
14,Mr SCULLIN,PROHIBITI ON OP AN D,"Instruction s have been given to inquire immediately into . luxury. price of a number of items in the list. Obviously, I cannot discuss the list item .by item until the schedule is before us. The honourable member has, of course, raised a very much bigger question than of any additional price that may be caused by this proclamation. His question involves the whole subject of pro Still, as he has drawn attention to barbed wire, I shall the ask that an investigation be made.",12
15,Mr HUGHES,PROHIBITI ON OP AN D,"Will the Prime Minconister inform me what steps the Government proposes to take to protect the public from exploitation in regard to the price of goods enumerated in the schedule tabled yesterday, and in the proclamation issued today, which are already in Austhe tralia or on the water, or otherwise covered in the terms of his statement ciryesterday? A lower duty has been, or will be, paid on those goods. A higher price must necessarily, or probably will, be charged on goods subject to the new duties. What does the Government into do to safeguard the interests of the public while goods of the classes mennot subject to the proclamation or of surcharge, are still available ?",12
16,Mr SCULLIN,PROHIBITI ON OP AN D,"No one knows better in a than the right honourable member for more North Sydney the difficulty which the he Government finds in dealing with that question. We hope that the power of Parliament will some day be increased so that we shall be able to deal the with such a situation more effectively. clearly The Government will very carefully pro- , watch the trend of prices. But the only weapon that we have in our possession to honprotect the public is the power to vary the duties, or lift the prohibitions if the new conditions arc applied unfairly . to the public. The power of rationing can be used to any extent if we find that an Westattempt is being made to corner any article. Business people who attempt to adopt measures of this description may themselves in difficulties because of Tariff the admission of additional supplies of as the articles concerned from overseas. > of The bulk of' the goods included in. the list of prohibited articles are, in the the opinion of the Government, largely luxuries.",12
17,Mr FRANCIS,PROHIBITI ON OP AN D,Barbe d wire is not a,12
18,Mr SCULLIN,PROHIBITI ON OP AN D,"I am aware of that. But most of the goods in the list are luxuries. Some of them are, of course, necessaries of life, which are being made in Australia in large quantities. In respect to those articles I believe that we can rely on the competition already here to regulate prices. But we shall not be satisfied with even that. We are taking up the subject of prices with a number of manufacturers with the object of protecting the public from exploitation. gard to some items, particularly those in the important group under the heading, "" Agricultural machinery"", we have already received undertakings that prices will be actually reduced. NA PROPOSALS .",13
19,Mr BAYLEY,CONSTITU TION ALTERATIO N,"In view of the fact that the Attorney-General (Mr Brennan) had spoken on the debate ou the Constitution Alteration Power of Amendment Bill before the publication of Sir Edward Mitchell's opinion that the proposal was unconstitutional, will he take advantage of the introduction of the Constitutional Alteration Industrial Powers Bill to discuss, that opinion ?",13
20,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITU TION ALTERATIO N,I shall be glad to express my view of the opinion of Sir Edward Mitchell in due course. NEW GUINEAGOLD - FIELD S.,13
21,Mr JAMES,CONSTITU TION ALTERATIO N,"In view of the fact that this Government holds a mandate from the League of Nations to administer the Territory of New Guinea, will the Prime Minister inform me whether there is any truth in the statement that has been published that British foremen have been dismissed from the Edie Creek goldfields in order that Italians might be engaged with a view to reducing producing costs and forcing more work out of the natives, who are recruited from native villages to work on the fields under sweated labour conditions? Will the Prime Minister have inquiries made into the whole position?",13
22,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITU TION ALTERATIO N,"- I heard late last night the rumour referred to by the honourable member, and made an effort this morning to obtain official information from the Administrator, but a reply to my inquiry has not yet been received. Communication was, however, established with the manager of the company concerned, who described the rumour as a deliberate lie. I understand that the services of five for e i g n e r s ^! do not know their nationality-possessin g special qualifications for the work upon which they are engaged, have been secured. To say that British foremen have been replaced by foreigners is, to use the words of the manager, "" a In re- deliberate lie."" The Government is making further investigations through official channels. NA PRIMARY PRODUCERS. Mr M . CAMERON - It is reported in the press that an agricultural conference recently held in Victoria the Minister for Agriculture of that State, Mr Slater, said that the associated banks, in cooperation with the Government, had agreed to make available *£200,000 in order to assist in the placing of an additional area under wheat. As the Prime Minister stated that the Commonwealth Government had made arrangements with the Commonwealth Bank to make short-dated loans to primary producers, I desire to know if the Commonwealth Government is cooperating with the States in this respect, or is the arrangement mentioned by Mr . Slater quite apart from that referred to by the right honourable gentleman ? "" Mr Scullin - The statement. I made some weeks ago was that the Government had discussed with the representatives of the Commonwealth Bank the making of credits available through other financial institutions to 'assist primary and secondary production, but that assistance to primary industries was the immediate concern of the Government, For some weeks the Commonwealth Bank has been in close touch with the agricultural banks in the various States which are now making these advances. The Rural Bank of New South Wales has had credits given to it for the purpose of assisting the primary producers of that State, and a similar course is being followed in Victoria. The Commonwealth Bank is behind all these arrangements, and. so far as I know, is willing to make furthe r advances in. approved cases to assist primary production. NA MANUFACTURES.",13
23,Mr NAIRN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,In order to assist in restoring the present adverse trade balance has the Government formulated any proposals for increasing the export of Australian manufactured goods?,14
24,Mr SCULLIN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The Commonwealth Government is encouraging every manufacturer who can do so to produce goods for export. One of its latest actions in this respect wa3 to increase the wine bounty, to assist the exportation TARIF F PROPOSALS.  Minister disclose how the Government proposes to meet the deficit that will naturally arise in consequence of the embargo which has been placed upon certain importations, and the consequentloss of revenue that will result?",14
25,Mr SCULLIN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"The whole financial position of the Commonwealth, and the proposals which the Government will have to submit in connection with the deficit, will be announced by the Treasurer when he delivers his budget speech. As the honourable member has always been an advocate of free trade in so many commodities, I wonder how the loss of revenue would have been made up if effect had been given to the policy which he advocates?  sonal explanation. The Prime Minister, in replying to my question, has done me an injustice.",14
26,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Has the honourable member been misrepresented?  outside this House I have consistently advocated a revenue tariff. When the right honourable gentleman made the statement to which I am objecting he knew that I have always contended that if customs duties were reduced revenue would increase and the cost of living would in consequence be lower.,14
27,Mr SCULLIN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,I regret if I have misrepresented the honourable member for Forrest.,14
28,Mr SPEAKER,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Does the right honourable the Prime Minister wish to make a personal explanation?,14
29,Mr SCULLIN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Yes . I assure the honourable member for Forrest that if I misrepresented him I did so unwittingly. I based my reply, however, on the opinions I have formed of his opinions after listening to his speeches in this House on tariff matters during the past six years.",14
30,Mr WHITE,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,Has the Government considered any preference proposals in connection with Great Britain and other purchasing nations in relation to the of wine. latest customs imposts?,14
31,Mr SCULLIN,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"No consideration was given to protection or preference in preparing the schedules recently submitted to Parliament; the Government's sole consideration was the reduction of imports by the imposition of higher duties on or the prohibition of such imports as are detrimentally affecting our financial position. In formulating its policy the Government considered only what commodities can be manufactured in Australia to meet our requirements and what can be regarded as non-essential. Incidentally, the preference to Great Britain on a number of items has. been increased. Where a duty is imposed against Great Britain and higher duties against other countries, the British preference remains in the same ratio. On some items on which no duty is imposed against Britain the duty against foreign countries varies from 10 per cent, to 20 per cent. Ob : viously where there is an increase of 50 per cent, in such duties against foreign countries and Britain is on the free list, the British margin of preference will be increased.",14
32,Mr YATES,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I ask the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) if the decision of the Government to prohibit the importation of certain goods and to impose higher duties on others was animated by a circular letter from a firm carrying on business at 65 Gawler Place, Adelaide, in which the following paragraph appears:Although the latest duties imposed on English cloth have brought the rate at least 30 per cent, above what it was 18 months ago, we are not increasing our prices for the coming season for the following reasons. We have some stocks of cloth not affected by the new duties, similar to later purchases, and obviously we cannot have two prices for one quality. As a result of strong representations to the manufacturers we hope there will be a sufficient drop next year to counter the new duties. In view of the depression through which we are passing, we will be quite content to mark time in order to continue with the quality of cloth we have always submitted, which, generally speaking, is well above the average displayed. alternative is to replace with Australian manufactured goods. While these could be sold at a much lower price it would virtually mean persuading our customers to accept a quality below their previous standard. Was the Minister actuated hy the sentiments expressed in that circular in framing the latest tariff proposals?",14
33,Mr FORDE,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"Whil e the letter read by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . Yates) is most interesting, I may say that the Government was not actuated in any way by the contents of that or any other such communication. As the right honourable the Prime Minister has said, the desire of the Government is to reduce imports, and in doing so to select those lines which can be manufactured in Australia, or those which can be regarded as non-essential. TRADE BALANCE.",15
34,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"In view of the Government's obvious anxiety to reduce the trade balance, I ask the Treasurer if his attention has been directed to a statement of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) in which he shows how, in his opinion, our trade balance can be adjusted. The honourable member for Adelaide stated that owing to circumstances beyond his control he had been prevented from placing his proposals before the House. Will the Treasurer consider this scheme and facilitate the bringing of it before the House for discussion by the honourable member for Adelaide?",15
35,Mr THEODORE,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,When the Budget is being prepared the Government will consider any scheme that is brought under its notice.,15
36,Mr YATES,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"I desire to make a personal explanation. I did not say that I had been prevented from submitting my proposals to this House. I said that 1 had refrained from doing so owing to certain circumstances; my action was quite voluntary. I recognized that it was my duty to the party of which I am a member to assist the Government, and in order to do so I placed on record certain figures which are irrefutable. If the honourable member ' for Warringah will study them he will see that they cannot be controverted.",15
37,Mr AROHDAXE PABKHILL,EXPORT OF AUSTRALIAN,"As I have The been misrepresented by the honourable member for Adelaide, I desire to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Adelaide said that he was not prevented fro m bringing his proposals before the House, but I understand that in a communication to the Government he stated that owing to circumstances beyond his control he was unable to bring the matter before Parliament. I submit that the words I used were substantially the same as those contained in the honourable tneinber's statement. NA NA AUSTRALIA. FORMAL MOTION FOR ADJOURNMENT .",15
38,Mr SPEAKER,REPRESENTATION I N,"Hon.NormjanMakin). - I have received from the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely. ""The fact that the Commonwealth Government is the only dominion government which has expressed its willingness at the present time to receive a consul from the Russian Soviet Government, notwithstanding the recent religious persecutions, the barbarous and brutal treatment of its farmers and the continued propaganda by the Russian Soviet against all other governments."" Five honourable members having risen in their places Question proposed.",15
39,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION I N,"Cowper) [11.29]. - As stated by you, Mr Speaker, I wish to bring under the notice of the House the fact that the Commonwealth Government is the only dominion government which at. present has expressed its willingness to receive a consul from the Russian Soviet Government, notwithstanding the recent religious persecution and barbarous and brutal treatment of farmers in that country aud the continued propaganda by the Russian Government against all other governments. I have taken this course because of a cablegram which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of ""Wednesday last, givsentation ing a reply by the Secretary of State Foreign Affairs to a question asked in British House of Commons, which I conconscience sider casts an intolerable slur tralia, and on me as an Australian citizen. The newspaper paragraph ferred to readsTlie Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Henderson), replying to Sir Nicholas Grattan Doyle, in the House of Commons, that the Commonwealth Government on January 10 requested Great Britain to inform the without consulting Parliament. Soviet that if it wished to appoint a Consular officer in Australia the latter would accept if lie were acceptable, and the Soviet an undertaking regarding propaganda. Australia was the only dominion making the request. Sir Alfred Knox: Will you warn the tralian Government? Mr Henderson did not reply. That information has been disseminated throughout the world, it is true that Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) has atpress tempted to lessen the seriousness of the position by saying that the Commonnature. wealth did not take the initiative by asking for a consular representative of the Soviet in Australia, but merely gave perthe mission for hisappointment. My motive in moving the adjournment of is to ask the Government to reconsider the permission it has given, a permission atrocities? which I feel sure is distasteful to the great majority of the people of Australia, irrespective of party. The action of the world. Soviet Government in persecuting religion and committing atrocities of the kind against Russian Christians, its barbarous treatment of the Russian farmers and the confiscation of their goods after having induced them to improve their position, its attempt to subvert other constitutional governments throughout the world, has outraged public feeling every country. I wish to make it clear that in condemning the Soviet Governbrutal ment of Russia for these things I exclude the Russian people. They, unfortunately, are under the control of a minority munistic government whose actions place it outside the pale of civilization. saying these things, I am expressing views similar to those expressed in the House of Lords by the Archbishop of CanterGovernment bury when he urged the British Governoured ment to review its decision to allow Soviet Republic ambassadorial repreGovernment Dr Earle Paye. in Britain, events in Russia for for which the Russian Government was the responsible having violated the"" public of Britain, and, indeed, of on Ausevery civilized country. I submit that in a matter of such imreportance as the granting of consular rights to the Soviet Republic, which throughout the world is active in attempting to subvert constitutional government, said the Government should not have acted The newspaper article to which I have referred sets out that the permission of tinsigned Commonwealth Government to allow a consular representative of the Soviet Republic in Australia was granted ou the Aus10th January last. Even though the Government did take .this action without consulting Parliament, it should have brought the matter before Parliament at. the first, opportunity thereafter. We in the this House should not have to rely on a paragraph for information of this I wish to make it clear that I am not now attacking the internal policy of the Soviet Government. What Government of Russia does in its own country is not the concern of the the House citizens of Australia.",15
40,Mr BLAKELEY,REPRESENTATION I N,Not even the alleged,16
41,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION I N,Thos e atrocities have shocked the conscience of the whole,16
42,Mr COLEMAN,REPRESENTATION I N,Hav e the reports conworst cerning them been verified?,16
43,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION I N,"Yes . I shall give the House verification of them which no honourable member will dispute. There are at least three reasons why, at this juncture, the Australian nation should not recognize the Soviet Republic. in The Government of Russia is unworthy of such recognition, first because of its and uncivilized actions in connection with its anti-God campaign; secondly, because of its ruthless savagery comtowards the Russian farmers in dispossessing them; aud thirdly, because of its In continued attempts to bring about a world revolution, and effect the destruction of the British Empire. I expect that the will reply that it has endeavto safeguard the position by securthe ing an undertaking from the Russian that no propaganda shall be curried ou. The Government has proceeded very cautiously and nervously in this matter. It is evident that it realizes the dangers which surround the action it has taken. There can be no question as to the activity of the Soviet-Government in disseminating propaganda. There was clear evidence in 1925 that communistic activities were responsible for the shipping strike in Australia, and for continuous attempts to detach the dominions from the British Empire.",16
44,Mr LEWIS,REPRESENTATION I N,The right honourable gentleman is now engaged in anti-Soviet propaganda.,17
45,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION I N,"Surely I am entitled to do that in an Australian parliament? If the honourable member suggests that in this place honourable members are not entitled to defend our own Constitution, it is time for this Parliament to close its doors.",17
46,Mr LEWIS,REPRESENTATION I N,Why not let the Russian Government run its own country?,17
47,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION I N,"If it were acting in A way worthy of a civilized people, there would be no need for criticism. When a massacre occurs in China or the South Seas the civilized nations of the world combine, not only to alleviate the distress occasioned thereby, but also to prevent a recurrence of such a happening. Some honourable members opposite sneered when mention was made of the religious persecutions which have taken place in Russia. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) inquired by interjection whether the reports concerning the atrocities in Russia had been verified. Unfortunately, there is ample evidence that these atrocities have been committed. Indeed, the Soviet Government itself has officially admitted that it has ordered a number of executions. I realise that excesses are associated with every big revolution - If during the first two or three years of the Russian revolution there had been excesses, desecration of the symbols of Christianity, executions and murders of those who perform its rites, we might have overlooked them; but they are still a part of the considered policy of the government of that country. T n order to show the truth of the reports regarding these atrocities, let me quote first from statements by Sir Philip Gibbs, who has visited Russia and has written a number of books dealing with conditions in that country. Writing in the Loudon Daily Mail, Sir Philip Gibbs said:Their Government is founded upon blasphemy. Not content with destroying civilization, they have abolished God. At a Red ""Christmas"" procession in Moscow last year a prostitute posed as the Virgin Mary, and an effigy labelled ""Almighty God"" was burned in a bonfire. Bolshevik writers regarded this orgy as the beginning of a new ""era of reason,"" One declared ""Our Soviet young men have been the first to break the Celestial front. The Christloving bourgeoisie persists in its ignorance, and it felt sick on this historic day."" All c i v i l i z at i o n f e l t sick on that day. Sir P h i l i p Gibbs continues:The Moscow Soviet has tried hard to uproot all Christian traditions from the nation it dominates by terror. It was made illegal to put religious emblems on Christinas trees or anything recalling the sacred character of the festival. Tho war on the Church has been waged with malignant energy. Monday, instead of Sunday, was made the workers' legal day of rest. Churches and monasteries were stripped of their treasures on the - pretence of purchasing supplies for the victims of famine. In Moscow 25 convents and monasteries were turned into barracks, students'' hostels nnd dance halls, and emblazoned with the ""battle cry"" of the war against the Church: ""Religion is an opiate of the people."" Bishops and priests were arrested in scores for resisting the spoliation of religious buildings. Mgr. Budkiowicz, a Roman Catholic ecclesiastic, was executed in a cellar; twelve dignitaries were sent to remote prisons in Siberia: the Patriarch Tikhon was sentenced to death and confined for a year in a filthy dungeon. The ""Supreme Church Soviet,"" formed to take the place of the Patriarch Tikhon, decreed that the baptism of children was illegal. The Soviet stands by its declaration against religion. Karakhan, Assistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs, writing to the Chaplain of the Archbishop of Canterbury, referred insolently to ""the class solidarity of princes of the various churches, which solidarity is known to be directed against the labouring masses. Not content with the abolition of God, the Bolsheviks sought for further expression of their hatred of Christianity. They erected a statue of Judas Iscariot at Sviashk, near Kazan, in the summer of 1923, and the unveiling of this ""memorial"" has been described by M. Hailing Koehler, a Danish writer, who was present. That was the positio n up to 1924. As I have said, we m i g h t make excuses for excesses in the e a r l y stages of a revolu t i o n . But w h at is the positio n in Russia today, twelve or t h i r t e e n years a f t e r the revolutio n began? That it is g e t t in g worse rather than better is shown by a letter from the Pope to the Vicar-General, as reported in the West Australian of 1.0th February last The Pope condemns the sacrileges and wickedness perpetrated in Russia against God and the souls ot men. He invites Roman Catholics throughout the world to pray for the cessation of the moral ancl material destruction of religions in places under Soviet control. He deplores the fact that the Soviet is perverting youth and contaminating souls with all sorts of vices and destroying intelligence and human nature. He adds that had the nations at the Genoa Conference in 1922 acceded to his request and agreed to insist on religious freedom in Russia, the world would have been spared many evils. The Pope denounced the burning of thousands of churches, the suppression of the observance of Sunday, and public acts of sacrilege such us mock religious processions and spitting upon the Cross. The Pope intends to continue his campaign against Russia. He intends to call an international conference at the Vatican city to discuss the methods being employed by the Soviet to destroy Christian civilization. He announced that he would celebrate Mass for atonement, propitiation, and reparation at St. Peter's Church on 19th March. A f e w days later, on the 14th F e b r u a r y , .1930, the same newspaper contained the following statement:The Archbishop of Canterbury, at a meeting of the Convocation of Canterbury, moved that a protest he made against the religious persecution in Russia. None could question the truth, he said, of the long and shocking tale of imprisonment almost unparalleled in the history of religious persecution. A unique feature was that every sort of belief in God was assailed, accompanied by popular blasphemies, obscenities, and ridicule, which were encouraged and even ordered by the Government. I hope that the bishops will be willing to request prayer to be offered in all the churches on 19th March. At that time multitudes of fellowChristians at the bidding of the Pope will combine with our prayers. The Bishop of London seconded the resolution, which was carried unanimously. On the 10th March last the Sydney visualize, Morning Herald statedMr Henderson laid a White Paper on the ' table of the House of Commons relating Soviet Decree on Religion of 8th A p r i l, 1929. It disallowed organization of meetings of dren and young people and women for prayer, biblical study, or teaching religion. T w o days l at er that newspaper conthem tained the following report : Mr Henderson, in reply to a question in House of Commons, said that from a study of the Soviet Government's decree he had no doubt it indicated a continuance of the anti-religious Dr Earle Page. pressure which had consistently and for many years been a notorious feature of Soviet policy. "" Howling hyenas "" is M. Bukharin's description of the church leaders who joined in a protest against the Soviet's policy against religion. Writin g in Pravda, he says that just when the Soviet people were laying successfully the eternal foundations of a beautiful and lofty building, all their enemies-cardinals , priests of different Gods and churches, English lords, French usurers, American money-bags, professors, spies, and the inevitable Pope-starte d the campaign against them. Again, on the 3rd March, the Sydney Morning Herald published the following statementIn his Lenten Pastoral, to be read in Roman Catholic churches on Sunday, Cardinal Bourne refers to the "" awful and menacing condition of Russia."" He calls for prayers for "" our suffering Russian brethren-Catholic , Orthodox, Protestant, and Jew-wh o are being crushed and overwhelmed to destruction, which only the adversary of God can inspire. There is abundant proof that agents of religious anarchy in Russia are training and sending forth emissaries to bring about the same ruin of civilized government and organized religion wherever they can get a footing or obtain a hearing."" That is uot the statement of a p o l it i c a l partisan.. Y e t Australia ' s reply to t h at is to t e l l the w o r l d that she alone, of all the B r it is h Do m in i o n s , is prepare d to accept a consular representative of the Soviet Government. On l y yesterday, accordi n g to the cabled news from L o n d o n , the A r c h b is h o p of Can t e r b u r y , speaking in the House of L o r d s , s a i d In 1928, according to reliable statistics, 359 churches, 78 monasteries, 50 synagogues, and 38 mosques were closed, and hundreds more were closed last year. He had received reports of 20 cases of persecution which he was satisfied were authentic. In these 20 cases 71-persons were sentenced to he shot, and 112 were sentenced to imprisonment for from two to twelve years I in v it e honourable members to try to if they can, w h at is h a p p e n in g in Russia at the present day, and centuries a f t e r the rest of E u r o p e has ceased to the religious persecutionHe did not question the advantage of having chila British representative in Moscow and a representative of the Soviet Government in London, but these advantages carried with special responsibilities. Sooner or later our own Government must eorivey to the Soviet Government an intimation that if relathe tions were to be diplomatically satisfactory, the Soviet Government must pay some heed to the public opinion of this country which, in this matter, he believed to be singularly clear and united. It was for the Government to decide at what time, in what way, and within what limits, representations should be made. They could not expect, nor even ask, the Soviet Government to change its attitude towards religion, for that attitude was its own religion, but that they had a right to ask that in pursuing it they would pay some heed to the claims of the churches. That is the attitude which honourable members on this side of the House take up today. We are not concerned as to the particular religious dogmas of the people of Russia or of any other people; but we are concerned when the policy of barbarous and ruthless extermination of all religious belief is being pursued as it is today in Russia. We consider it. is necessary, therefore, that before the Government permits a consular representative of the Soviet Government to take up residence in the Commonwealth, it should demand something more than s written promise that Soviet propaganda will not be continued in this country. We should have preliminary definite information jthat the Soviet Government will , and can, control propaganda. Moreover, we should not admit an official representative of the Soviet Government to be appointed to Australia until we have definite, evidence that the ruthless savagery which has been practised against Russian farmers for some years has been abated. It is worthwhile recalling what has been happening in that country. At the outbreak of the revolution, the objective of those who took control of the government of Russia was to bring about the collective ownership of land; to create what was, in effect, a great agrarian slave movement. But the farmers rebelled. They declared that they would not produce foodstuffs unless they received reasonable prices for their products, and as the result of their obstinacy there ensued a food famine in Russia. In 1921 the Soviet Government, to meet the situation that thus had been created, adopted what was known as the new economic policy, under which capitalistic enterprise was permitted to a limited extent. Small traders were allowed to earn profits and to develop business enterprises outside government agencies in the villages and small towns. Farmers also were allowed to own land, and many of them were encouraged to increase production. Those farmers who by their t h r if t and industry acquired some capital were called Kulaks. But recently the Soviet Government deter-* mined to carry out a five years' intensive industrial programme with the object of wiping out all these "" Nepmen,"" as these traders in the villages are termed, as well as abolishing private ownership of land and confiscating assets of the farmers by substituting for it big collective organizations. The situation in Russia was discussed recently by the New Statesman, an English publication which represents the Liberal and Labour opinion of the mother country. Other articles that have appeared in that paper strongly endorse the attitude of the British Labour Government with regard to Russia, so it cannot be regarded as hostile to the British Labour movement. This is - what the New - Statesman had to say on the subject:To-day the situation has undergone a radical change. With the introduction of the five-year industrial plan, the Nepmen have been swept out of existence, and now a semi-military campaign of agrarian "" collectivisation "" is being launched against the richer peasants and against the whole system of peasant proprietorship. The very nature of this experiment must awaken doubts in even the most optimistic observer. Already it has encountered a degree of opposition which, in view of the overwhelming physical force on the side of the Government, is remarkably active, and today the spectre of civil war stalks once more over the Russian countryside. . . . The most ruthless measures are being employed to put the plan into effect. In Moscow itself the Right Opposition in the Communist party has been checkmated and reduced to impotence. A centralized Commissariat for Agriculture, under the control of the energetic M. Yakovlev, has been given full powers to deal with the recalcitrant peasantry. By a recent decree the local village Soviets have been purged of their Kulak members. Poor peasant has been incited against rich peasant, and the whole force of the government machinery, including special battalions of Red soldiers and ""Hammerers' Brigades,"" has been set in motion in order to make the plan a success. Already a considerable number of collective farms are in existence, and every factory that can manufacture tractors has been working day and night to supply the necessary equipment. Some of these model farms have won the admiration of others than Communists. American agricultural engineers, whose advice has been sought, have given them their blessing, and at least one American banker has been persuaded to advance credits for the supply of tractors The plan, however, has serious drawbacks. Hitherto, the Kulaks or richer peasants .supplied the Bolsheviks with a large portion of their grain. These unfortunate beings being subjected to the severest persecution. wealth. Their farms, including their supplies of seed and their live-stock, have been seized and handed over to the now "" collectives."" In order ganda that the local So.viets may be tuned up proper pitch of ruthlessuess, special detachments of proletarian enthusiasts have been spatched from the industrial centres to vise the confiscations. Resistance is punished by banishment imprisonment, and, if necessary, execution. The Kulaks are reacting to this treatment in a typically Russian manner. Unsource able to organize themselves in suflicient force vities to defend their homes, they are now destroying such their belongings, including their live-stock their grain, partly through a misguided instinct of revenge, and partly because they imagine that they are thus wrecking the pects of collectivization and thereby securing their own preservation. The evidence is indisputable that, withstanding the announced policy of Soviet Government, Russian farmers who were induced by that government to grow more grain Russian people are now being dispossessed of their holdings, and are even being executed because they have dared to stand up for their rights. This is a definite breach of faith with people. We are full y justified in assum-' ing that if the Soviet Government w i not keep f a it h with its own people i not keep faith with the people of other countries. My third objection to the official nition of Soviet consular representation Australia is based on the Government's policy of against other forms of throughout the world. In 1924, Zinovieff, in a letter addressed to the German munist party, as a guidance to its action in the forthcoming elections, stated that peace.and order were necessary to make the Dawes plan workable, ancl order simply meant the shameI ful exploitation of the proletariat. fore, it must be the object of the German Communistic party to see that peace order did uot prevail. The Chronicle, in 1925, pointed Zinovieff had declared that the policy the Russian Communistic destroy the British Empire. It has not since changed its policy, and yet we are to have an official representative Soviet Government in Australia, the only Dr Earle Page. safeguard apparently being a written ashave surance that Sovietism will uot carry on are now an active propaganda in the CommonThe position in regard to Soviet propawas well stated recently to the by Mr Snowden, the present Chancellor deof the Exchequer in the British Governsuperment. Speaking of the situation in China at the end of 1927, he pointed out that it was almost impossible to ascertain the of the communistic actiwhich at that time were a disturbing influence in and Chinese affairs. He went ou to - say that the Comintern aud the Russian prostrade unionists were a trinity-the e in one and one in three. They were always one as regards executive action, and notalways three when an attempt was made the to fasten responsibility upon them. He went on to say that much of the trouble in China in 1926 was traced to antif or the British propaganda by the representatives of the Soviet Government, and that it was practically impossible to exercise any control over them. When this matter was referred to in a debate in the British Parits own liament in November last, the Pravda, the official organ of the Soviet Government, l l pointed out that the Soviet Government t will was utterly unable to accept responsibilit y for world-wide communistic activities, or to guarantee B r it a in against attempts to foster communistic colonial recoguprisings against the British yoke. in That is how the Soviet regard the relaRussian tionship between Great Britain and the propaganda Dominions! Russian newspapers also government expressed the opinion that the resumption of diplomatic relations with Great Britain Comwas merely another move in the game, and that there was need felt in British official circles to deal with their disruptive activities in the Dominions. The British but peace press expressed their anxiety on this point. n J u l y last the Chinese Government Therecharged the Soviet Government with breach of f a it h in connection with railand ways administration in Mauchuria and Daily charged them with carrying on propaout that ganda against the Government underof taking. We all know of the trouble that party was to arose out of that incident. I therefore say that before this Governof the ment recognizes the consular representative of the Soviet Government, it should demand something more than a written assurance that Russian representatives in this country will not carry on propaganda work. I take the view that these should not be admitted until we have practical evidence extending over a definite period of say three or six months that the Soviet Government can and will prevent communist propaganda in Australia. That was a safeguard the Bruce-Page Govern-, ment would have insisted upon in regard to propaganda whatever other conditions were laid down. I ' assure the right honourable the Prime Minister that I have not submitted this motion in any party spirit, but because of the attitude of the Russian Government towards its people and because the active propaganda of its agents in other countries is exercising the minds of hundreds of thousands of people in this country. I therefore urge the Government to at least delay recognition of the Soviet consular representatives until it has secured from the Soviet substantial guarantees concerning propaganda in Australia.",17

He told the House that he had not brought forward this motion "" in any party spirit."" Actually there is nothing but political propaganda behind his motion. Dr EAKI.E PAGE - That is not so.",21
49,Mr SCULLIN,REPRESENTATION I N,"The party which I have the honour to lead is not a stranger to this conduct on the part ef honourable members opposite. It has been their custom to link up the Labour party in Australia with the Soviet and its institutions. Indeed, this was the trump card of the previous administration, and the party which supported it .for many years. When the people of Australia found that all that was being so said about the Labour party was so much political propaganda, and untruthful, they returned Labour to power. Then the leaders of the political forces opposed to Labour believed that a Labour government would make so many mistakes that they would soon be able to discredit it. Apparently, that is one of the reasons why the right honourable member moved the adjournment of the House this morning. The motion is essentially^ a political move to place the Government in a difficult position. If the right honourable gentleman was honest and sincere in his intention, why did he spring the motion upon me this morning at. an hour's notice?",21
50,Mr WHITE,REPRESENTATION I N,I asked the Prime Minister certain questions about this matter last week.,21

52,Mr SCULLIN,REPRESENTATION I N,"Of course nobody knew, because the right honourable gentleman kept his intention a close secret, until he gave notice of it to my secretary this morning. In the course of his speech, he' stated that he was basing his case upon cabled news published last Wednesday, to which he made reference in the House, but he took very good care to keep his intention to himself in the hope, no doubt, that he would have the Government at a disadvantage.",21
53,Dr EAKLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION I N,Nonsens e !,21
54,Mr SCULLIN,REPRESENTATION I N,"Fortunately , we have a complete answer for the right honourable gentleman, as I shall proceed to show. He takes, first of all, a cablegram published in the Sydney Morning Herald, which, he states, is a slur upon Australia. It reports an answer given in the House of Commons by Mr Heuderson, which I have not the slightest doubt, was altered in ""transmission, to the effect that we asked for a consul for Russia to be appointed to Australia. I have already answered that, and my reply was published in the press this morning. The right honourable gentleman could have known whether it was true or not by asking me; but he preferred to make political capital out of the incident. If he had been honest in his assertion that he did uot wish to make political capital out of it, he would have asked me if it were true. Instead of doing that, he used this cabled message as an excuse for moving the adjournment of the House, and to stir up political jjropa, ganda of the kind that has served him and his party to such good purpose, in years gone by. I propose to give honourable members a brief history of what led up to, the question of a Russian consul in Australia, and I have obtained my information from the official records in the External Affairs Department. The original records are all there, and if honourable - members wish I will arrange to make copies of the relevant papers available so that those who desire to confirm what I say may study the records for themselves. On the 24th June last, months before this Government assumed office, His Majesty's Government in Great Britain advised the Commonwealth Government that it was considering the resumption of normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Republics. The Commonwealth Government on 29th June informed His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom that it recognized the unsatisfactory nature of the present relations with Russia.",21
55,Mr LACEY,REPRESENTATION I N,That was the Bruce-Page Government.,22
56,Mr SCULLIN,REPRESENTATION I N,"Yes , the Bruce-Page Government said that. The Bruce-Page Government stated further that the Government considered that the suspension of normal diplomatic relations could not be indefinitely continued. The message proceededThe re-establishment of official relations should, however, be subject to certain conditions in respect to propaganda, agreed to after consultation with His Majesty's Government in Great Britain. And that is precisely what this Governmen has asked. I ask the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), did all these awful things which are supposed to be happening in Russia, only begin since the Bruce-Page Government sent that message? If so, the right honourable member must withdraw all the things he said during the years 1922, 1923 and 1925 by way of propaganda against this party regarding its relations with Soviet Russia.",22
57,Mr GUIXETT,REPRESENTATION I N,Did our Government appoint the consul?,22
58,Mr SCULLIN,REPRESENTATION I N,"No , it did not; nor have we appointed him.",22

Most of the interruptions are coming from the ministerial side of the House. I ask honourable members to restrain themselves, both in their applause and in expressing objection to statements made.

On the 12th July of last year His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom advised the Commonwealth Government of its substantial agreement with the views of the Commonwealth Government, and said that it was despatching a note through the Norwegian representative in Moscow to the Soviet Government. The right honourable member for Cowper places the responsibility for what has been done upon this Government, but it is evident from my explanation that our action is merely a natural sequence to that taken by the last Government.",22
63,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION I N,The.Prime Minister's idea of safeguards is quite different from ours.,22
64,Mr SCULLIN,REPRESENTATION I N,"The right honourable gentleman's idea of safeguards was expressed by the Government of which he was a member, and for his benefit I shall again read what that Government said:The re-establishment of such relations would, however, be subject to certain conditions in respect of propaganda, agreed to after consultation with His Majesty's Government in Great Britain. Those conditions were agreed to, and are set out in a document containing mutual pledges. The right honourable member for Cowper said that we acted without informing Parliament, and that he had to learn of what was taking place from the press. That is absolutely incorrect. Negotiations followed the delivery of the note to which I have referred, and finally, on the 3rd of October last, a protocol was signed by British and Russian representatives, setting out the procedure for the resumption of diplomatic relations. A copy of the protocol was laid on the table of the House of Representatives on the 22nd November last. That arrangement was completed before this Government took office, and there is no record of a word of protest having been uttered by anyone associated with the last Government.",22

67,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,REPRESENTATION I N,"If it is good excuse, why not?",23
68,Mr SCULLIN,REPRESENTATION I N,That excuse is a very bad one.,23
69,Mr LATHAM,REPRESENTATION I N,What date does the protocol bear ?,23
70,Mr SCULLIN,REPRESENTATION I N,"It bears as its date the 3rd of October. The Government has been accused of taking no action to inform Parliament of what was being done. I laid upon the table of this House a copy of the protocol on the 22nd of November last, and yet the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) said that he knew nothing about it until he read of it in the newspapers. I suggest that if he attended more closely to the affairs of this House he would know more of what is taking place. The next step was an exchange of ambassadors at the end of December, between Great Britain and the Soviet Union, and on this occasion, in conformity with the terms of the protocol, notes were exchanged on the subject of propaganda. By these notes both Governments confirmed the pledge with regard to propaganda contained in article 16 of the general treaty of 1924. I have already published in the press on more than one occasion, statements dealing with this phase of the negotiations. In a second exchange of notes the Soviet Government stated that it considered the undertaking as extending also to the dominions, and that as soon as the Government of any dominion had regulated its relations as the circumstances required, the Soviet Government would repeat the undertaking in an exchange of notes with that dominion. Prior to 1926 the signing of such a protocol would have bound every dominion, but a doubt arose after that as to whether such arrangements could be made binding on the dominions, and the British Government accordingly communicated with the dominions in respect to this matter. The Commonwealth Government took the view that since an ambassador, of the Soviet Republic had been accredited to His Majesty the King and His Majesty was once more represented by an ambassador in Russia, there would be no justification for the Commonwealth Government declining to accept a Soviet consular representative in Australia, proa vided the person proposed for the post was persona grata, and provided the Soviet Republic repeated, on the basis of reciprocity, the undertaking as to propaganda in an exchange of notes with us.",23
71,Mr WHITE,REPRESENTATION I N,Is the Prime Minister aware that the Soviet Government originally refused to agree to the British Government's request that it should refrain from propaganda?,23
72,Mr SCULLIN,REPRESENTATION I N,"I am aware that the Soviet Government has signed a mutual pledge with the Government of Great Britain to refrain from conducting propaganda within the British Empire. A copy of that mutual pledge is among the documents which I have laid on the table of the House. If the honourable member thinks that he knows more about the conduct of diplomatic .relations than does Mr Ramsay MCDonald, he is vastly mistaken. When the Russian Government inquired through the British Government whether the Commonwealth Government had any objection to the appointment of a Russian representative I asked, on the 16th January, that they might be informed in reply that the Commonwealth Government would be prepared to accept a Russian consular representative in Australia, subject to the usual condition that the person proposed was acceptable, and subject also to a formal reciprocal undertaking in respect to propaganda. is the position today. I wish to point out to the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) that the resumption of diplomatic relations does not, as he seems to think, justify him in attempting to link up this Government in some way with the horrors and atrocities which he said were being perpetrated in Russia. The existence of diplomatic relations between nations does not make one nation in any way responsible for the internal affairs of the other. It would be just as fair to accuse the King, who only last week received the Soviet Ambassador at a Royal levee, of being associated with what, is going on in Russia. Not only Great Britain , but twenty other nations as well have established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Government of Russia. If the pledge strength of which we have re-established diplomatic relations with Russia, is broken by the representative of that country, we shall ask that he be withdrawn, in the same way as we would ask for the withdrawal of any other consular representative who abused his consular privileges. I point out to honourable members, however, that while the Russian Government signed a pledge not to interfere in our internal affairs, we are pledged not to interfere with theirs. It is a mutual pledge.",23

[Standing Order suspended, sion of time agreed to.] The right honourable member for Cowper stated that the Archbishop of Canterbury had moved in this matter in the House of Lords. That is true. The right honourable member also said that the Archbishop of Canterbury had asked that the subject of diplomatic relations between Great B r it a in and Russia should be reviewed. Is that true?",24
75,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION I N,I was reading f r the Sydney Sun of last night.,24
76,Mr SCULLIN,REPRESENTATION I N,"I also have a copy Such of the Sydney Sun, but I find nothing in it to that effect.",24
77,Dr EARLE PAGE,REPRESENTATION I N,I read it there.,24
78,Mr SCULLIN,REPRESENTATION I N,"I challenge the right honourable member to show me in the Sun's report anything to the effect that the Archbishop of Canterbury asked for a review of the diplomatic relations with Russia. What the Archbishop did was to direct. attention to religious persecution in Russia, and to ask the Government to make representations to the Soviet Government to discontinue those persecutions. I think that I speak for the overwhelming majority of the people when I say that whatever truth there may be in the reports that we have read nobody will approve of religious or other persecutions or atrocities. One thing that the people of this country stand for is liberty on the of conscience, and the right to worship their God at any altar they choose. The Archbishop of Canterbury, who has a broader mind than the right honourable member for Cowper, did not insist on the withdrawal of the recognition of Russia, hut asked that representations be made to the Soviet Government. A fte r having made that request-whic h the right honourable member read in such a way that its significance was lost-the Archbishop saidHe did not question the advantage of having a British representative in Moscow, and a representative of the Soviet Government in is a London, but these advantages carried with them special, responsibilities. members. I entirely endorse that sentiment. Then he went on to sayIt was for the Government to decide at what time, in what way, and within what limits representations should be made. They could not expect, nor even ask, the Soviet Governand exten- ment to change its attitude towards religion, for that attitude was its own religion; but they had a right to ask that, in pursuing it , they would pay some heed to the claims of the Churches. That was a broad, statesman-like utterance. The Archbishop did not go to the length to which the right honourable member went, because he was not spreading political propaganda. Tho reply of the representative of the British Government I endorse as my reply to the right honoro m able member, because it is couched in language to which no exception can be taken, and lays down the sound principle that the diplomatic relations between nations should not be affected by their internal affairs. Lord Parmoor, speaking in the matter. in reply for the Government, saidT!is Government liad no intention whatever, unless the condition attached to diplomatic relations was infringed, of severing relationCanterbury ship with Russia, or weakening the opportuby nity that might be afforded through that relationship of influencing conditions Russia. It was not easy to say what the Oo-'crnment could do to influence those ditions. He was glad to see some change (-->-.""'i place; but in the meantime the terrors nf this movement undoubtedly prevailed Russia-, though ho believed they were terrible now than at any time during the last British ten years. The separation of schools - State, lamentable' as it was in Russia, had been a matter of some differences of opinion in other countries; but surely the attitude of any State towards education was purely the internal concern of each government, and no representation on such issue could be justified. They all detested the systematic denial of religious tolerance in Russia, but no outside government could rightly act in sueh case unless two conditions were satisfied. First, it would need to have overwhelmingly accurate proof that wrongs were being committed, so grave in their nature and extent that they came to be the concern of the whole civilized world. The principle that one country should not seek to interfere with the internal affairs of another government was Secondly, the Government must have good reason to hope that its action would really alleviate such wrongs, or at least not do more harm than good. Now I come to a quotation of the speech of Viscount Brentford, who, as Sir William Joynson-Hicks, was Home Secretary in the Baldwin Government. There is no evidence that he asked for the severance of diplomatic relations, as the right honourable member, without knowledge, rushes into suggest. Viscount Brentford remarked, "" Surely the Government could make friendly representations to the Russian Government regarding the suggestions made by the Prime Minister."" Lord Buckmaster, Liberal leader in the House of Lords, saidHe was in sympathy with the Primate's desire that they should express their abhorrence at what was taking place in Russia; but when it was sought to enforce their opinion in some manner by political action, he thought they were on doubtful, and even dangerous ground. Dr Laug, the Archbishop, in summing up, expressed his gratitude that the debate had been free from political controversy, and added that he was not without hope that representations made in a friendly way might have some effect There is a great difference between the stand taken in Great Britain by Liberals and Conservatives, and by men like the Archbishop of and others, and that adopted the Opposition in this House. In in Great Britain the Government was not harried for political reasons. Although conAustralia is the only dominion that has had yet fallen into line with Great Britain, in I have to learn that it is wrong for less a dominion to be in agreement with the Government. Twenty other from the nations are in line with it. We have been 'given an account of the atrocities perpetrated in Russia. To whatever extent the reports may be true, they find no sympathy in the breast of any honourable member of this Parliament, or of any citizen of the Commonwealth. All persecution ou account of religious belief is intolerable. The treatment of the peasants of Russia has been emphasized by the right honourable member, and it is suggested that it would justify the breaking off of diplomatic relations involved. with"" that country. Should Ave withhold whatever influence Great Britain and other nations may be able to exercise over a country such as Russia? Diplomatic relations were not broken off when as great, or greater horrors, were perpetrated under the rule of the Czar. There was no protest against, or repudiation of, the atrocities perpetrated under the leadership of the bestial Rasputin. Not a word of protest came from this Parliament or this country because diplomatic relations were then allowed to continue. I am making no apology for what is now taking place in Russia, but I point out that the psychology of her people has been created through centuries of atrocities and political persecution. In my youth I read the story, and saw the pictures, of the ancestors of the Russian peasants of today dragging their chains through the snows to Siberia. I also remember the account of "" Red Sunday,"" when Russian people were shot, down in thousands. Unfortunately the psychology then produced still obtains. The things that are now done there could not occur in countries that have enjoyed better conditions than those of Russia. Let us hope that, the resumption of diplomatic relations, short extracts. aud by means of friendly representations', the more fortunate nations may influence the psychology of those people who are but emerging from centuries of black it degradation.",24

The whole issue is whether it was wise and desirable that the GovernGovernment, ment should have intimated what it has intimated through the British Government the to the Soviet Government of Russia. The Prime Minister dealt to a slight extent with that subject, but many of his remarks were entirely irrelevant to matter raised by the right honourable memgested ber for Cowper (Dr Earle Page). did, however, devote a good deal of attention to the attitude of the late vernment. I know exactly what that attitude was. As the Prime Minister said, on the 24th June His Majesty's Golutely vernment advised the Commonwealth GoThe vernment that consideration was being given to the resumption of diplomatic lations with Russia, and on the 29th June a reply was sent by the Commonwealth Government. JFrom the terms of that upon reply the Prime Minister has made Let me inform the House more fully of the attitude adopted by the late Government. In addition to what has been said by the Prime Minister, said this, after referring to the necessity for undertakings regarding propaganda- My Government would prefer that as a preliminary to the extending of the invitation a Soviet representative to visit London, definite conditions upon which a discussion for the resumption of diplomatic relations would have be based, should be laid down. But definite conditions were not laid down. There was a great deal of disupon the procedure to be adopted in inviting the Soviet representative, but the invitation was actually sent before Goany agreement had been reached regarding propaganda and other matters. a consul The Government, however, was of Commonopinion that no steps should be taken in the direction of extending the invitation until these conditions had been laid down. Purther, the late Government went on to say that it also considered that a discussion between the Cowvarious governments of the Empire take place prior to that basis being to determined; in other words, that before the conditions preliminary to the issuing of the invitation were determined there should be a discussion as to those conditions between the various parts of the Empire. That condition has not been satisvenfied. The Labour Government of Great proceeded on different lines, as it was perfectly entitled to do, but upon lines that were objected to by the late and are still objected to by present Opposition. Our conditions not being satisfied, on the 3rd October last a protocol was signed, as the Prime Minister has said, aud that contains a certain undertaking with respect to the propaganda. The Prime Minister sugthat the late Government He should have taken some steps on behalf of the Commonwealth to indicate Goits attitude to that protocol. I put it to honourable members that action of such a character would have been absounjustifiable in the circumstances. Government had been defeated in the House, and an election was to be held rewithin a fortnight, and, under these circumstances, it would have been entirely wrong for any government to profess to represent the Commonwealth in an imsideration portant international matter such as this. Then we come to the action of this Empire. Government. On the 10th January informed the Russian Government, through the British Government, that was willing to receive a consul if certain conditions were fulfilled. The conditions were, first, that the individual should - p&rsona grata, and, secondly, that there should be an undertaking against proare paganda. Australia is the only dominion which has gone so far as that. No other part of the Empire, having regard what has happened since the 3rd October, position. is prepared to take similar action. This question involves no interference in the domestic affairs of Russia, but it involves an endeavour by outsiders to bring about interference with our own affairs. We know that the Soviet Government is founded upon a policy of world revoluSpeaker, tion. Its object is to bring about a world revolution and to upset the governments of other countries. Since the 10th January certain events have taken place. adjournment. They have been referred to by the leading ecclesiastical authorities mentioned by the right honourable member for Cowper, are of such importance that they demand a reconsideration of the position. The Prime Minister has said that the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord the Brentford do not recommend breakp.m. ing off relations with Russia. submit that there is an essential difference between the establishabout ment of a new relation and the breaking off of an existing relation. Entirely different questions arise in the two cases. In the case of Great Britain, the question before the mind of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other gentlemen of the House of Lords and the British Governvisited ment was whether existing relations should be broken off. The question which is before Australia at the present time is whether a new relation should be established, opportunities afforded to agents of the Soviet Government, it having acted as it has done during the last two three months, to establish themselves Australia ou the strength whatever written or verbal undermember taking they may give. The facts which have been mentioned by the honourable member for Cowper make a not strong and powerful case for the of this matter in the light of the interests of Australia and of the That case is not answered it by pathetic references to peasants walking in the snow in chains.

On another occasion certain Australians holding Soviet ideas Moscow, and there reported that, while their numbers in Australia were small, their influence was great. The Labour party, as it then stood, repudiand ated, any association or sympathy with Soviet agents in Australia; but this action which the Government is now taking or has brought about a certain amount of in disquiet in the minds of the people. The of House is indebted to the right honourable for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) for bringing this matter forward. The right Prime Minister, although he did treat the subject with the reconseriousness that it deserved, was quite correct in his references to the psychology of crime, and the spirit of persecution and of revenge that have beeu bred in the Russian people for centuries; but is that any excuse for that country, under its re-organized conditions, endeavouring to extend its propaganda to every other nation of the. world? It was shown clearly in October last that there was a Russian agency in this country, spreading Soviet sentiment. Is there any need for such propaganda in Australia, the most democratic country in the world, where the people themselves, under proper legal and Parliamentary procedure, determine their country's destiny? The attitude of the Bruce-Page Government was fundamentally different from that of this Government. Our trade relations with Russia are not of such considerable magnitude that, they should be taken into serious consideration. It would be a fair demand to ask Russia ro pay her debts to the British Empire before we receive its representatives in our midst. I cannot understand why Soviet Russia should seek to have representation in this dominion, and, as a matter of policy and in the interests of Australia, it is a great mistake for us to permit a Soviet consul to take up residence here. I hope that the Government will reconsider the position, because it seems to me that the influence and effort of this consul will be in the direction of applying to Australia the conditions which are operating in Russia. I support the motion and the attitude of my leader, the right honourable member for Cowper.",27
84,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,REPRESENTATION I N,"Warbrutalities ringah) [12.40] - This House is inImperialist debted to the right honourable member Cowper (Dr Earle Page), for bringing this matter forward, because it is indeed time that we explained to the Empire and the world at large, why Australia is ""First Blood ""the first of all the dominions to accept the representative of Soviet Russia in a consular capacity.",28
85,Mr MOTIEKNAN,REPRESENTATION I N,What about Great Britain itself?,28
86,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,REPRESENTATION I N,"I great am speaking of the dominions of the Emoverthrow pire. An explanation is due to the why we should be the first of all dominions to accept the representative the Soviet, when other nations such as United States of America have declined to do so. We have to take into account considerations other than the mere formalities between nations, and since the Soviet Government has said to the people of Russia, and to the world at large, "" Thou shalt know no God, but ine."", I .submit that 'this Parliament should seriously consider the position before it accepts a consular representative of such a Government. It has been said that Great Britain has received a Soviet ambassador, but let me remind honourable members that Russia owes Great Britain hundreds of millions of pounds. Great Britain at first took the stand that it would not accept an ambassador from Russia, but soon found that the United States of America, which had refused to receive a Russian representative, was obtaining all the trade of that country - Therefore, the position of Great Britain is, from a trade and other points of view, vitally different from that of Australia. Great Britain accepted the Russian Ambassador only under certain conditions, and those conditions are not being complied with. On 1st January last, there appeared in London a newspaper called the Daily Worker. It contained a message from the President of the Communist International, which described the paper as- "" A new and powerful weapon in the hands of the British working class in its fight against capitalism, against rationalism, and the Social-Fascist Labour Government."" The paper is to. be a rallying point against the Labour Government of rationalism, anti-Soviet intrigues, colonial and preparations for another war. The Workers' Life anfor nounced on the 3rd January, that the propagandist message was the paper's first blow and that many more would follow. It also said in an article headed The message of the Communist International is attackedas a breach of an agreement between the British and Soviet Governments. This is purest subterfuge. The Communist International is the world organization of the revolutionary working class-the world party leading the struggle for the of capitalism and the establishment world of the working-class dictatorship. the That is the kind of propaganda upon of which Soviet'Russia is engaged in Great the Britain, and which, when the Russian consul is established here, will be disseminated among the Australian community. The present secretary of the Trade and Labour Council of New South Wales is a member of the T h i r d Internationale. Mr E . RILEY - Who is he?",28
87,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,REPRESENTATION I N," Mr Jock Garden, who sat in this inform very chamber during the early part of this week, and who - constant communication with Ministers while in Canberra. The Labour ment outside of this House reeks with its association with the Third Interas nationale. In its ranks there numerous men who have been in Russia and have absorbed and Russian doctrines. The establishment a Russian consulate in Australia w i l inevitably have the effect of crystallizing communistic anti-British subsidized by Russian money, that has been more or less active in our midst for years. If this Government were considering the workers, to whose interests i tributes only l i p service, it would have refused to accept a Soviet consul Australia u n t i l it was "" clearly lished that the pledge given to the Government, British Government is being observed. If that pledge is not honored, it is possible that Great. Britain will be January, obliged to do what it did before, ask the Russian ambassador to leave London. The fact that the Australian Governof ment has agreed to accept an accredited conspicuous, representative of the Soviet Government will prejudice our credit and the country itself in the eyes of the world. Ha d this Government been animated by that conimplied cern for the people that the Prime the Minister endeavours to make us believe it has, it would have proceeded slowly the matter, and have said, "" We are not yet prepared to accept this consul. shall wait to see what action 'the other dominions have taken, and to see whether the pledge given hy the Soviet in regard to its ambassador in England is. being honored."" The bringing to Australia of a provided person who will disseminate Soviet proright honourable gentleman paganda is a menace to the community. The insidious effect of that propaganda is The already apparent in our midst. Daily read of men with unpronounceable names being haled before the courts on charges of a seditious nature. To extend and perpetuate that evil can only have a detrimental effect on the fair name of Australia.",29
88,Mr WHITE,REPRESENTATION I N,"Balaclava) [12.50] On Thursday, the 27th March last, I asked the Prime Minister if he would the House whether, in view of the reported persecution of the Church in was in Russia, it would not be in the best interests of the Commonwealth if the moveappointment of a Soviet representative in Australia were postponed, especially no Australian representative is going are to Russia. The right honourable gentleman evaded the issue, aud replied only supported to the last part of the question. To-day, of in reply to my interjection asking if l he believed in the Soviet promises upon which he was basing the action of the propaganda, Government, he became personal and said that I claimed to know more about the subject than did the Prime Minister of England. I shall quote an extract from The Times Weekly Edition i u regard t conto a message that appeared in the Izvcstia, the official organ of the Soviet in Government, concerning this matter, estabwhich is sufficient answerJsvestia., the official organ of the Soviet on 25th January, printed a message from its London correspondent referring to questions put to Mr Henderson on 22nd in the House of Commons. The cor(respondent wrote of "" Mr Henderson's more than equivocal attitude with regard to it"" and declared that he had exposed his complete helplessness and confusion on the question' propaganda. It was rendered all the more the article continued, by the fact that, in spite of the reiterated questions of the Conservatives concerning the nature of the Soviet ambassador's reply to Mr Henderson's representation, the latter by his silence, the absence of one, whereas in reality, Soviet ambassador gave him a definite and wholly unequivocal reply to the effect that Mr Henderson's point of view on the activiin ties of the Comintern never was and never could be accepted by the Soviet Government, and, therefore, was always repudiated by its , We representatives abroad. The Prime Minister based the whole of his speech today on the assumption that certain safe-guards have been by the Soviet. Is the prepared to accept safe-guards of that nature? Izvestia intimates that the we Soviet does not intend to listen to the British Government in that regard. During recent anti-British and antireligious demonstrations, Russians burnt Mr MACDonald in effigy. In 1918 I was unfortunate enough to have to spend some time in Russia, as a fugitive, and, for some years previously, I had also been associated with Russians. My experience of that unhappy country causes me to have misgivings as to the aspirations of honourable opposite to become internationalists. My idea of an internationalist is a man who puts his own country last. If honourable members opposite were sent to Russia in the capacity in which I found myself there, and uot as a welcome envoy from the Australian Labour party, they might change their opinions with regard to the Soviet. There have been many strong protests from the churches against the attitude of Russia towards religion. Here is an extract from the Times Weekly which readsThe Pope has addressed a strong letter to Cardinal Pompili, protesting against the "" horrible and sacrilegious outrages"" perpetrated in Eussia, and announcing his intention of celebrating at St. Peter's on the feast day of St. Joseph (<19th March) a mass of expiation, propitiation, and reparation for all the offences against the Divine Heart. The mass, the Holy Father adds, should also he. "" a mass for the salvation of so many souls thus put to such dire trials, and for the release of our dear Russian people, and that these great tribulations may cease."" After recalling the failure of previous to stop this ""terrible persecution,"" which he has made from the very outset of his pontificate, the Holy Father declares that sacrilegious impiety rages not only against the priests and adult believers, but also against the young, whom it is sought to pervert by an abuse of their ingenuousness and ignorance. Instead of teaching science and civilization which, like honour, justice and welfare, cannot prosper without religion, the so-called "" League of Militant Atheists "" are seeking to "" conceal their moral, cultural, and economic decadence by a sterile and inhuman agitation."" Children are instigated to denounce their parents, and to destroy religious buildings and implements. Above all, it is sought to contaminate the souls of the young with every vice. As instances of official excesses, the Pope mentions that at Christmas hundreds of churches were closed, numerous ikons were burned, and work was forced upon school children and work people. Sunday had been abolished, and the compulsory signing of a formal apostasy had been enforced. The penalty of non-compliance volved the forfeiture of their bread, clothing, and lodging tickets, without which all the Mr White. inhabitants of that unhappy country were reduced to death by starvation, poverty, and cold. The Bishop of Chelmsford, a representative of the Church bf England, in his monthly diocesan message, quotes from a letter on the sacrifices of the Russian church, which he has received from the Metropolitan Antony, President of the Russian Episcopal Synod. The Metromembers politan saysAccording to our latest information, 31 bishops, 1,560 clergymen, and more than 7,000 monks and nuns have been killed without trial or hearing, solely for acknowledging Our Lord. Forty-eight bishops, 3,700 clergymen, and more than 8,000 monks and nuns are languishing in prison. The Books of Holy Scripture are being banished from libraries; their reading aloud, especially to children, in- . flicts a death sentence; public burnings of gospels and saints' images have been organized. Innumerable churches have been transformed into taverns and cinemas. The Bishop of Chelmsford mentioned that he has never taken any part in politics of any kind, and addedBut I feel that for our country to enier into political engagements with Russia while this state of things is going on is a course of action which cannot commend itself to the Christian conscience. The British communist newspaper, The Daily Worker, Jias challenged Mr Henderson to make public the reply of the Soviet ambassador to his protest against the message from the Communist Internationale which appeared in the first issue of that journal. Why is the Australian efforts Government signing an agreement with such a nation? Are we bringing this representative out here for trade purposes? Russia's trade with Australia is a negligible quantity. On the other hand, Russia is a serious competitor with some of our products.",29
89,Mr CUNNINGHAM,REPRESENTATION I N,Russi a buys extensively of our wheat and wool.,30
90,Mr WHITE,REPRESENTATION I N,"Russi a is certainly not a buyer of our wheat, but a competitor with our growers. The Assistant Minister (Mr Beasley) and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) are closely associated with the Soviet, being members of the executive of the International Class War Prisoners' Aid Society. They have been prominent in all industrial troubles. What f a it h can we put in any promise made by a representative of inSoviet Russia ? Honourable members must recollect a recent occurrence, where the Russian General Koutepof, a leader of a party politically opposed to the Soviet, was kidnapped in Paris and taken to Russia, where he is reputed have been tortured in an endeavour to extract certain admissions from him. Is Australia going to be privy to that sort of thing? Is it going to allow in its midst the representative of a government which persecutes the church and its followers, and kidnaps and tortures political adversaries? I was in Russia long enough to obtain a proper appreciation of that country. No doubt this representation would be very welcome to certain honourable members opposite, but the Labour party is not entirely unbalanced. Receutly the Prime Minister was complimented for speaking in unequivocal terms to certain industrial extremists in Australia. We know that the British Empire and the Church is the rock upon which communism has dashed itself in vain. On the score of patriotism and of Christianity, I appeal to the Prime Minister to consider deeply before accepting in our midst the accredited representative of this extremist nation, an action which could do us no good, but might do quite a lot of harm.

NA (TRADE AND COMMERCE) BILL . Motion (Mr Scullin ) agreed toThat he have leave to bring in a bill for an act to alter paragraph (i) of section 51 of the Constitution. Bill brought up, and read a first time. SECOND HEADING.",32
105,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [2.20] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. I-shall be brief in dealing with this bill because already, in introducing the Conwill stitution Alteration (Power of Amendmitted ment) Bill, I have covered its general principles, and in accordance with over Mr Speaker's ruling, I take it that future general discussion on that bill will also cover the discussion on this third measure. The object of this bill is that an extra question may be submitted to electors by referendum. As a matter of fact it was the original intention of Government to submit three questions but Ministers were reluctant to submit more than two, fearing that any other and among the States. course would confuse the minds of the electors. Many requests, however, have been made by honourable members who have spoken on the first bill-the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), and the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) particularly, graph were the first to make the suggestion, they have been followed by others-that the electors should be given a wider choice than was afforded, to them by questions originally proposed to be mitted to them. It was at first decided by Ministers that the question to be submitted under the Power of Amendment Bill would embrace all the powers that take could be sought for in other Constitution Alteration Bills, and that the only alternative to that major question should be one relating to a power most State urgently required by the Commonwealth, namely the industrial power. Ministers have now decided to submit to occasions. the people this extra question relating to trade and commerce. They that it is important that the trade commerce power of the Commonwealth should be extended and that in the munity there is a large section of people who, while not prepared to go to the extent of. granting the full power of amendment to this Parliament- I hope that a majority of the people will be in favour of granting that full power-wil l be pleased to be its afforded au opportunity to give at least larger grant of powers to the Commonculties wealth Parliament. Ministers believe that the fullest opportunity should be given to the electors to determine without confusion such an important question as the amending of the Constitution, and this bill enable au extra question to be subto them, making three in all-firs t full power to this Parliament to amend the Constitution; secondly, full power industrial matters, and thirdly full any power over trade ancl commerce. The. limitations of the Constitution in respect of trade and commerce have been the grave stumbling blocks to the operation of the National Parliament since federathe tion. The words in paragraph (i ) of section 51 of the Constitution areTrade and commerce with other countries It is proposed to ask the people to omit the words ""with other countries ancl among the States"" and give the Commonwealth full power over trade ancl commerce subject to the following provisoProvided that the alteration of this paraby Constitution Alteration (Trade and Commerce) 1930, shall not be construed to and empower the Parliament to make laws with respect to the control or management of railways the property of a State or the rates or the two fares on such railways. subOn previous occasions when power over trade and commerce has been sought, the argument has been advanced that if this power were given to the Commonwealth, it would enable the Commonwealth to over and control State railways, ancl against the wishes of the State railway commissioners,- fix fares and interfere generally in the management of what are concerns. In order to avoid that difficulty, this proviso has been included But as it has been included on former",33
106,Mr GREGORY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"""Would the same realise proviso be included in regard to the and Industrial Powers Amendment?",33
107,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . The Governcomment is seeking the fullest possible the powers for the Commonwealth Parliament. If the people are not prepared to grant the fullest powers, they are to be given two alternatives. It may be suggested that this represents on the Government's part a lack of confidence in ability to carry the major question. a But I say quite frankly that the diffiin altering the Constitution are very great. No government has yet succeeded in getting a major alteration passed. Even when both sides of this House were almost unanimously in agreement on the point, the people refused to grant a very much smaller measure of power than is now sought. In these circumstances, the person who declares that he is confident about the success of the present proposals, would appear to be deceiving himself as well as the public; but I have a great deal of confidence in the success of our proposals. The people, however, will be the judges, and the Government will accept their verdict as cheerfully as we did at the last general election. I do not propose to enter upon a full debate upon this bill because if I did so I should rather encourage the re-opening of the whole general debate, and it is the desire of the Government to get these bills through very early next week. The trade and commerce limitations upon the Commonwealth are very grave. They are illogical, because who can define what is interstate and what is intra-state commerce; who can determine when commerce ceases to flow across the borders of any State and begins to be interstate, ceasing to be intra-state? There has always been grave doubt upon the point, and, after all, what difference is there in the treatment of trade between Melbourne and Wodonga and trade between Wodonga and Albury ? To a large extent these restrictions of an artificial character on trade and commerce, one of the most important phases of life, make our Constitution ridiculous; as defined, our power is exceedingly narrow. If the power to alter the Constitution were given to Parliament by the people, it would enable Parliament to make this or any other amendment in the Constitution ; but it would not necessarily give Government a mandate to take that action. As the Treasurer pointed out in his second-reading speech, we should require a specific mandate from the people to take power over trade and commerce, but if this question and the industrial powers question' are answered in the affirmative this Government will have a specific mandate to deal with all dustrial and trade and commerce questions. In other words, by virtue of the Mr Scullin. carrying of the second and third questions, the Constitution will be altered in respect to industrial and trade and commerce powers. By submitting the proposals in this way we are giving the people several alternatives. We are. giving them the opportunity to say that this Parliament should have a general power to alter the Constitution; but if they are not prepared to go to that length, they will be able to give Parliament full power over industrial matters and trade and commerce. I shall quote the remarks of one of the great constitutional lawyers of Australia, the Chief Justice of Victoria, Sir William Irvine, in regard to the trade and commerce power of this Parliament. He said during a debate in this House in 1910There is no part of our Constitution in which we have given a more rigid adherence to a very ancient model than in the trade and conunerce clause. Later, in the same speech, he saidIt is just as impossible in commerce to draw a line of demarcation based on local geographical conditions as it would be to commit to the care of one physician a man's body and to the care of another physician his limbs. Each is part of one organic whole; and the results of the attempts has been perfectly endless litigation and uncertainty. It was pointed out by the late Hon. Alfred Deakin that the power of protection should carry with it industrial power. I add that it should also carry with it power to protectthe community from exploitation.",33
108,Mr WHITE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,From industrial exploitation ?,34
109,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fro m exploitation of any description. No exploitation of the people should be permitted, and Parliament should have power to prevent it. Very interesting questions were raised yesterday, and again today, in the disthe cussion on the proposals of the Government to prohibit the importation of certain goods and to put a surcharge on other goods to limit the importation of them. It was asked what power the Government would have to protect the community if an attempt was made to exploit it. It was pointed out by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. inGullett) that there might be an effort to create a monopoly in Australia because of the enforcement of an embargo or any high, protective policy, and that no matter how commendable might be the object, of building up our industries and of sheltering them behind protective walls, if such a monopoly were set up it might lead to exploitation. ""We grant that, but the reply is that that danger is always present, and that there should he power in the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament to protect the community as well as industries. It is true that protection may be lifted from an industry if the public be exploited; but the manufacturers may not be the offenders. It may be the distributors, and we have no power over them. It would be unfair to penalize the manufacturers for something the distributors had done. While I do not suggest that we should take over the' complete fixation of prices from beginning to end under the trade and commerce power- I believe that competition generally renders that unnecessary-it has occurred that advantage has been taken of our protective duties to exploit the community. We should have the power to stop that kind of thing by regulation or control. Where there is competition there is safety to that extent; but where a combination has been set up and prices have been fixed by a combine the Government has practically no power. In such cases Ave are under a system of government by the combines and not government by the people. We desire to substitute government of the people by Parliament. If there is to be any price fixing it should be done, not by private combines, but by the representatives of the people. If Ave are to build up the industries of Australia by scientific methods of protection-to use the term of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page)-w e shall if Ave can get such a thing as scientific protection, need more adequate and better regulated methods, so that Ave shall be able to protect the community Avhen that is necessary. If this specific power is given to us, either with or Avithout the general poAver that Ave are seeking, Ave shall be able to use it to the advantage of the people immediately. What an anomaly it is that although, under our Navigation Act, we can control navigation which extends beyond the limits of one State, we cannot control it if it is conducted only betAveen port and port in the same State! Surely we are one nation! It must be recognized that there is extraordinary difficulty in deciding Avhat is intra-state and what is interstate trade - A ship travelling from one port to another in the same State may also be engaged in interstate trade. At any rate, under existing conditions no one seems to knoAv where Commonwealth control begins and where it ends. The Seamen's Compensation Act is applicable to interstate but not to intra-state shipping. A seaman may be injured in travelling from one port to another Avithin a State and not be able to obtain compensation. I remember a case of the kind being discussed years ago in the early days of these debates. A seaman Avas hit on the head by a box of cargo while Avorking on an interstate boat, and it Avas argued that, although the ship was an interstate vessel, the box was intra-state cargo, and that, therefore, the Seamen's Compensation Act did not apply. Mr MCTiEMfAN - Was that the Kalibia case?",34
110,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I believe it was, though I cannot recall the decision at the moment. I have said enough to indicate the anomalies that are brought about by the stupid, artificial limitations that have been placed upon the poAver of this Parliament in relation to trade. If there is one thing that is an "" organic Avhole,"" to use the words of Sir William Irvine, it is surely trade and commerce. The very important subject of marketing, to which I referred in my speech on the Constitution Alteration Power of Amendment Bill is also involved in this ? measure. Whatever vieAvs honourable members may hold in regard to the organized marketing of our products they will surely agree that if the Commonwealth Parliament decides to organize the Australian market on a nation-Avide plane for overseas, interstate, and intra-state purposes, it should be able to enact legislation to carry out its decisions AArithout having to obtain the consent of Governments in six different States. We are bringing down a bill Will the object of consulting the farmers in regard to the formation of a compulsory wheat pool. If the farmers agree to the proposition, this Parliament Avill still have to obtain the consent of a number of State Parliaments before it can do anything. That is an intolerable position, particularly in a country like this, in which we are so dependent upon our production for export as well as for local consumption. Even if the States combined to form a nationwide wheat pool, or any other marketing scheme on a big scale, they would be entirely helpless unless the Commonwealth Parliament collaborated with them. When we talk about State rights and the rights of State Governments we need to remember that the States are not very powerful when it comes to dealing with large measures unless they can secure the active co-operation of the Commonwealth Government. With the frequent changes that take place in Commonwealth and State Governments it would be n marvellous thing if we could get all the States and the Commonwealth to agree to a particular thing at the one time. There should be no need to wait for that. The object of this bill is to give the people an opportunity to say that they are prepared to grant the Commonwealth Government full power over trade and commerce, even though they may uot be prepared to give it a general power to alter the Constitution. The general arguments that might be used in support of this proposal have been already stated in the debate on the Constitution Alteration (Power of Amendment) Bill, ancl I do not propose to go over them again. Debate (on the motion by Mr. LATHAM) adjourned. NA (No. 2). SECOND READING .",35
111,Mr THEODORE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"Dalley-Treasurer [2.46] - I moveTliat the hill he now read a second time. The necessity for the introduction this bill arose through the elimination of certain definitions from the Laud Assessment Bill which we discussed a week or so ago. It was thought some honourable members in this chamber that the definitions in question were not clearly expressed. A similar contention was expressed in another place, with the result that an amendment was made to the bill which was accepted by this ment recently. chamber. It became necessary therefore to bring down this supplementary measure to put the definitions on a better footing. The bill consists' of two provisions. The first contains new definitions of "" unimproved value in relation to improved land"" and "" value of improvements,"" to replace those eliminated from the previous measure. It also contains a definition of "" improvements "" designed to-meet all the objections raised in Parliament during the discussion of the other two definitions mentioned. The second provision relates to new regulations made upon the passing of the Land Tax Assessment Act 1930, in order to provide rules for the calculation of values of leasehold estates in the leases which that act caused to be taxable as from the commencement of the Land Tax Assessment Act 1914. The bill provides that these new regulations shall have the same retrospective operation as section 3 of the 1930 act, namely, to the date of the commencement of the Land Tax Assessment Act 1914. Until the passing of the 1930 act there was no power .to make regulations for the calculation of values of leasehold estates in the leases dealt with by that a.ct. Immediately that act was passed the necessary regulations were made. There is no power to enable the Governor General to make those regulations operate retrospectively, and Parliament is therefore asked to do so. The new definitions of "" unimproved value in relation to improved land"", "" value of improvements "" and "" improvements "" have been framed after further conferences with counsel who advised in the first instance. It is considered that ) the lines now recommended by counsel fully meet, the objections which were ' expressed in Parliament during the disof cussion of the rejected definitions. It will be seen that the new definition Tax of "" improvements "" now contains after the words "" improvements thereon "" the by words "" or appertaining thereto and make or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title."" These words appear in the definition of "" unimproved value '"" in the present law, but they were omitted from the definition rejected by ParliaThe observations of counsel regarding the insertion of those words in the definition are as follows:Tihe reason for the omission of those words was that although, in practice, their presence in the Section has not been treated as adding anything to the words "" thereon "", it has been felt that they might 'be used as a ground for seeking to contend that improvements which had not been effected to the land itself might nevertheless be taken into account. Up to the present it-has never, so far as we know, been held that account can the taken of improvements effected to other land and not to the property itself. The purpose of omitting the words in the bill was, therefore, to secure the continuance of the present state of things in 'this respect, and not to make any change. There was never any idea of adopting the definition suggested by Isaacs J in the MCGeoch case. If it is thought particularly desirable, in order to prevent misunderstanding as to the scope and purpose of the hill, that the words should lie restored, we think that in all probability, no great harm will be done hy inserting in the definition of "" unimproved value"" before the words ""did not exist"", the words "" or appertaining thereto and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title."" We think that it would be better to omit them for the reasons mentioned aibove; but since they have done no particular harm so far, their elimination cannot be regarded as essential. In regard to the views expressed in Parliament on the second proviso to the definition of ""value of improvements,"" it will be remembered that a fear was expressed by some members that that proviso would have enabled the department to exclude from the value of improvements such work or expenditure as that done or incurred in connection with the removal of suckers and new growths of timber resulting from ring-barking trees in order to destroy them in the process of improving the land. This will be of interest to the honourable member for  certain questions to me on the point. I quote now from the memorandum of counsel advising the Government on the matter. Cotmsel who had suggested the form of that proviso have made the following statement in connection with it:We understand that the language in whichthis proviso is expressed has led to some misapprehension being felt that, by it, it is being sought to introduce, in substance, the effect of the minority decision in MCGeoch. This was certainly not intended, and would not, in our opinion, be the effect of the proviso. The form which it does take, however. makes it easy to understand how the misunderstanding occurred; and we have therefore drafted an alternative proviso, which is designed to make it clear that all that is intended is to prevent it from being successfully contended that an allowance should be made for mere recurring maintenance and upkeep expenditure, as improvements. We have drafted the new proviso in such a way as to indicate, we think clearly, that any recurring expenditure which is affected in the case of permanent improvement such as suckering following upon ringing in the course of destroying timber) is to be allowed, but annual maintenance is not to be allowed. We think the new proviso meets the difficulty expressed in the Senate. The draf t proviso prepared by counsel is one which it was suggested should be added to the definition of ""unimproved value in relation to improved l and "" in place of the former second proviso to the definition of ""value of improvements.""  and fern-cutting regarded as an annual improvement ?",36
112,Mr THEODORE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"It may be difficult to draw a line of demarcation, but there is a difference between work of that kind which is an improvement on land, and should be taken into account in arriving at the unimproved value, and work which is only maintenance. The department proceeds on a recognized practice in determining such factors. As stated earlier in the session, it is the Government's desire to restore the practice in force before the decision in the MCGeoch case.  the direction of the destruction of ferns, scrub ancl other vegetable growth, extending over a period of five years, come under this definition?",37
113,Mr THEODORE,LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL,"If five years' operations were necessary to eradicate ferns or scrub, or other vegetable growth, the whole of the expenditure so incurred would be taken into account in arriving at the unimproved value. The Attorney General's Department carefully ' considered counsel's suggestion, and came to the conclusion that its substance would be better placed in the act in the form of a definition of "" improvements"" for the purpose of causing "" improvements"" to include certain work but not other kinds of ""work. Counsel concurred in this view ancl then considered the full for m of the necessary definition. The definition now appearing in the bill is that which is recommended by counsel subject to slight verbal alteration made by the Attorney General's Department to clarify one part of the draft prepared by counsel. The new definition of "" improvements "" renders it unnecessary to retain in the definition of "" unimproved value "" in relation to improved land, the words "" i m provements, if any, thereon or appertaining thereto and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title "", as these words now appear in the definition of "" improvements "". The new definition will require the word "" improvements"" wherever it appears in the act, to be interpreted-unles s the contrary intention is clear-as meaning the improvements on or appertaining to the land and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title. The next part of the new definition when read in conjunction with the succeeding parts, means that when a taxpayer acquires land which is infested to any extent with vegetable growths or animal pests, and destroys them, that operation is to be treated as an improvement. Being so treated, the added value, if any, which that improvement in that condition gives to the land will be included in "" value of improvements "", subject to the terms of the definition of "" value of improvements "", viz., that the added value shall not exceed the cost of making the improvement. The third part of the new definition means that the term ""improvement"" shall not include the destruction of any vegetable growths or animal pests which establish themselves on the land during a taxpayer's ownership except to the extent, if any, to it restores the utility of a previous improvement produced by destroying vegetable growths or pests, when that utility has been impaired subsequently by the inroads on the land of fresh vegetable growths or animal pests. In considering the form of the new definition of "" improvements"" counsel took into consideration the siderable necessity or otherwise of specific reference therein to the work of destroying suckers and seedlings which are incidental to the destruction of timber. On this point counsel has expressed the Mr Theodore. view that the form of the definition in the bill causes the destruction of such sucker? and seedlings to be an improvement on or appertaining to the land, and therefore considers it is unnecessary to make any specific reference to that operation. Counsel, however, stated that if the inclusion of such a reference would remove apprehension as to the scope of the provision, the words might be included. This course has been followed. It will be seen, therefore, that the new definition fully meets all the objections which were raised in Parliament against the second proviso to the definition of ""value of improvements"" as originally submitted to Parliament. The Government feels that it has covered, in the new form of the definitions, all the objections that were raised and are entitled to consideration in finally settling these complex definitions in a very important law. It is hoped that the bill will be dealt with next week, so that it can be sent on without delay to another place for consideration, and be finally passed. Debate (on motion by Mr LATHAM) adjourned. NA (POWER OF AMENDMENT) BILL . SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 3rd April (vide page 874), on motion Mr SCULLINThat the h ill be now read a second time.",37
114,Mr MARRS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [3.53] After the busy day we have had, I am very severely handicapped i u rising at this hour to address myself to this important measure. During the eleven which years I have heen a member of this Parliament I have always looked upon Friday as being, in a sense, a special day due either to the humour of the House, the delivery of an important speech, or the occurrence of some startling incident. To-day has been no exception to the rule. We have had very important proposals before us this morning, and I find condifficulty in concentrating upon making the measure now before us. Whatever may be the views of honourable members on beth sides of the chamber concerning these proposals, I think it will be agreed that, having regard to the short time that the present Government has heen in office, and the large number of major questions that have been submitted-to such an extent that the notice-paper is already crammed-that could be made by producing and exhibiting in Australia or abroad a film which might be termed ""Hot-speed Scullin."" I remember some years ago when we were meeting in Melbourne, an occasion- I cannot recall the subject which was under consideration-when , in drawing an analogy, I referred to the good ship "" Commonwealth."" The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley) ancl I have had many a laugh over it. On that occasion I pictured the good ship "" CommonAvealth"" proceeding in very stormy weather under the command of Captain W. M. Hughes. One dark night a member of the crew named Page dropped a spanner from the top deck on to the captain's head. Shortly afterwards a neAv captain named Bruce assumed command. Some years later, when I discovered that he Avas trying to drill a hole in the vessel, I had the unpleasant task of dropping a political spanner on his head. Similar thoughts-pursuin g the maritime metaphor-occu r to me today in considering the bill now before the House. Over a quarter of a century ago the people of the Commonwealth desired to make a voyage to a promised land, known as ""Federation,"" but before doing so they consulted a celebrated firm of naval architects ns to the type of vessel to be used. At the head of that firm was a man whose name is revered- I refer to the late Sir Henry Parkes-whil e the other members of the firm Avere Deakin, Reid, O'Connor, Braddon, and many others Avho have now passed on. The people of the CommonAvealth consulted that firm concerning the design of the ship which was to be known as the "" Commonwealth,"" and eventually plans and specifications Avere drawn up and the vessel built in the Queen Victoria dockyard in the Old Motherland, and sent hack to Australia. In the earlier years of the A'essel's activities she Avas equal to the job, but as time passed on she was found to be somewhat small for the purpose for which she was constructed. She was faithfully built with a rigid keelthe Constitution-Avit h 128 solid sections of* solid ribs, and eight chapters which might be termed the stringers. From time to time during her voyage it Avas money found that she Avas too small for the work, and many attempts were made to insert new ribs. Some were put in, but the others were rejected by the owners - the people of the CommonAvealthbecause they Avere considered unsound. This is another attempt to strengthen the vessel. During the last few Aveeks I have, with the assistance of the ex-Commonwealth Historian, Dr Watson, spent considerable time in looking back over the speeches of the great men Avho have gone. It was a long, interesting, but someAvhat tedious task. But I endeavoured to find what Avas in the minds of these men Avhen the CommonAvealth AVUS being established. At that time many conventions were held, and the people A\'ere not keen on an alteration of the then existing system. An endeavour was made to get the people to think federally, and to put aside State rights. It seemed to me quite clear, from all the speeches delivered at that time, that State rights were inviolate, and must not be interfered Will except Will the consent of the people. Sections 1 to S of the Constitution can be altered only by the British Parliament. This CommonAvealth Parliament has power to alter 21 sections, those sections being easily identifiable by the Avords ""until the Parliament otherAvise provides."" But quite two-thirds of the Constitution can be altered only after the people have been consulted, and then only if the alteration is approved by a majority of the members of both Houses of Parliament, a majority of the electors of the CommonAvealth, a majority of the States, and a majority of the people in each State. The Treasurer (Mr Theodore) by interjection asked how can we assume Avhat the framers of the Constitution meant. I think that it is clear from the Constitution itself what this Parliament can do and what it cannot do. I , listened Will pleasure to the speech of the Treasurer (Mr Theodore): It : was one of the finest speeches to which I have listened in this Parliament during the last eleven years. What a fortune the honourable member has lost through not being at the bar I What a power he would exercise over any jury! It was a pleasure to see him standing in his place, with a full house listening to him, and almost every member of the Opposition bombarding him with questions, and to observe how he dealt with them. As he spoke, I could not help thinking that if he could continue another half hour he would have the Opposition going to the country in support of the Government's proposals. I wish that I had his power; but, unfortunately, I have to struggle along with what brains I have.",38
115,Mr CUSACK,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,The honourable member did good work with the spanner.,40
116,Mr MARRS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"I was forced to use it, because I shall always stand for loyalty, integrity, and honour in public life, and loyalty to the platform of one's party. I shall do my best to put out of office any government which I find doing what Mr. Bruce tried to do. I regret that I cannot support the first referendum proposal. Apart from the legal opinion of Sir Edward Mitchell, that even if the referendum is carried, it will be ultra vires of the Constitution, I am of the opinion that to give Parliament the power sought by the Government would be to destroy the foundation on which the Commonwealth has been built. The democratic vox populi was heard at the last election. We should not attempt to silence that voice. Instead of attempting to take to itself the power to alter the Constitution at will, Parliament should consult the people. If it finds that the Constitution is too narrow, or the ship too small, it should go to the people for fuller powers-for a larger ship. If the people grant to this Parliament the powers sought to be conferred upon it by these proposals, their control will pass from them forever. When the States accepted federation, they did not dream that such a proposal as this would ever be placed before them. I ask honourable members supporting the Government, what might have happened during the last industrial crisis if Mr Bruce, the then Prime Minister, had the powers now sought by the present Government? The powers sought' by these proposals are far too dangerous to be given to any government. I do not share the fear of some honourable members of the Opposition that the present Government would do the most awful things if these powers were conferred upon it. Honourable members will do well to remember that in this House they are the representatives of the people, and not only share a great honour, but also carry a great responsibility. Surely no body of men would come here and seize the first opportunity to place on the statute book, legislation of a despicable nature. I agree with those honourable members who say that an ample safeguard against irresponsible legislation is the necessity for members to submit to the judgment of the people from time to time. The last Government learned that it could not fly in the face of the electors. The position wa3 well summed up in the leader in the Melbourne Age on the l'7th March lastInherent in this system was the principle of consultation with the people on all questions pertaining to the alteration of the Constitution. The referendum is the very core of the structural plan. It was not contemplated in IS!)!), and is not contemplated now, that every clause in the Constitution should he for ever sacrosanct, .that the charter as framed should remain eternally inviolate. It was, however, deliberately resolved that not the legislature but the people and a definite majority of them must sanction such amendments as changed conditions proved to be desirable. In proposing that the referendum be discarded, the Government seeks to remove the constitutional kernel and leave an emptv shell. While I cannot accept all the reasoning of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), I agree with him. that the strength of the Constitution is its appeal to the people. That point is continually stressed in the Constitution itself. Nor can I accept the view that the Government has no right to introduce these proposals. In bringing them forward, it is giving effect to the plank of the Labour party platform. The Bruce Page Government was put out of office for departing from its platform. I had a hand in displacing it, and for that reason members of the Nationalist and Country parties with the exception of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson), for whom I have the highestrespect, have left the chamber rather than listen to me. That does not concern ine in the least, for in turning out. that Government, I merely exercised my undoubted right. This Government is certainly endeavouring to put its policy into operation. It has suspended compulsory military training, because that also is a plank of the party's platform. Another plank, concerning which the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) was perfectly frank, is unification. Although unification is yet a long way off, in New South Wales, at least, the movement towards it is steadily growing. E do not regard myself as a unificationist, although I favour the abolition of State Agents General, and State Governors, as well as n reduction of State members. The work of the Agents General could be done by the High Commissioner, and that of the State Governors by-Lieutenant-Governors. I represent in this Parliament the district of Wentworth, which in the New South Wales Parliament is represented by five members. There is no need for so many State members. The first of the Government's proposals is a step forward towards unification, and for that reason if; would be better to withdraw it, for it will almost certainly interfere with the chances of success of the second proposal. I am glad that the Government has agreed to submit to the people a third question dealing with the control of trade and commerce. The Commonwealth Parliament should have that power. Dealing with the Government's proposal in respect of the control of industry, both the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) and the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), urged that this was not the place to discuss questions of wages, and hours, and conditions of labour. To some extent that may be so, but surely this National Parliament has a right to deal with matters of national importance. Is there anything more important to Australia today than the industrial life of its people 1 In the industrial sphere Parliament can, of itself, do very little. It would, therefore, do well to heed the advice of the honourable member for Fawkner, and endeavour to discuss industrial matters in a more Christian spirit. But I want to go further. After all, the wealth of the nation is produced by its workers. Unless workers are contented and happy, [30] I am not likely to get much out of my investments, nor are the workers. Other people with money to invest are in the same position. Consequently it is to. our interest, as well as to the interest of the workers, that there should be industrial peace in Australia, instead of industrial strife, as has been our experience in recent years. Under existing conditions this Parliament has not sufficient power to legislate with respect to industrial matters. The Government is asking the people to give itwider powers, and if I may judge from observations in my electorate, the Ministry has every chance of being successful. Recently, as a member of the Empire Parliamentary Association, I paid a visit to Canada and the United States of America, and I made it my business to inform my mind as to what is happening in those countries. I was particularly struck with the remarkable improvement in the condition of the Canadian National Railways, which, as honourable gentlemen know, is a mammoth railway undertaking, although the Canadian Pacific Railway system has always been far ahead of it. Some years ago, the position of the Canadian National Railways corresponded to that of the New South Wales railways, which this year will show a deficit of about £1,275,000 or £2,006,000. The situation was so serious that the Canadian Government secured the services of an eminent British railway engineer in the person of Sir Henry Thornton to investigate and advise. The task ahead of that, distinguished engineer was infinitely greater than that which now confronts Mr Cleary in the management of the New South Wales railways; but last year, when I was in Canada, I was astounded at the marked improvement in the system. I have travelled several times over each of the railway systems in Canada, and I was much impressed with the marked improvement in the types of carriages on the Canadian National Railways, also the courtesy of railway servants, the service in the dining cars, and the general standard of efficiency, .which was fairly close to that of the Canadian Pacific Railway system. The change was entirely due to Sir Henry Thornton. Naturally, as an Australian who has aii interest in the success of government business undertakings, I made it my business to ascertain bOw the improvetotogether ment had been effected. Sir Henry blindly Thornton's policy is, in short, to ^ "" Trust the worker; bring himi n and ask his opinion. Ask him to help you. Do not She be afraid to disclose your books, and your profits. If yOu have watered your stock, tell him so."" Indeed, this is only way in which any business can succeed. Sir Henry Thornton has then expressed his views oh the relations of ployer and employee in the following terms:The worker, no less than the capitalist, is ah investor. The latter invests liis money, and the former invests his only resources-hi s lahour. The capitalist endeavours to make investments which are safe and permanent. The same motive actuates the worker, his chief desire being to secure employment which is continuous and which will bring to him ""a sufficient reward to enable him to live in comfort and decency, and educate his children as self-respecting members of society. In this laudable ambition he wins the good wishes of all, and this seems to be the common ground upon which labour and capital can meet. Another man whose opinion I value very inUch is Mr W. L. Baillieu. Few men have built up such great industries as those with which is associated, including the Electrolytic Zinc Company, in Tashis confidence, mania. A few weeks ago Mr Baillieu returned from a world tour, and in a help, statement to the press concerning Ausof tralia's industrial position, he madu the following points in a statement:We must increase' production of our own necessities, improve relations within our industries, nnd rationalize our industries. Another man for whom I have a sreat respect is Mr Gepp, Until recently the Chairman of the Development and Migration Department. I am glad that the Government has decided not to dispense entirely with his services, hut that his opinion, will still be sought in respect of migration and developmental problems, although possibly to a less extent than formerly. Mr Gepp, who has had un^rivalled opportunities to form a sound judgment upon the industrial situation in Australia, made the following statement iii a speech delivered not SO long ago:The greatest problem facing Australia at the present monicht is unemployment, with all its caused ' and effects Mr Marks. of all sections of the nation being drawn in an indissoluble bond to give strength a long drawn out national effort, we have engaged in internecine conflicts concerning the division of the spoils which have, iii many cases, not yet been won. Australia cannot afford to stand still for one moment. must advance or perish. If we cannot, show establish a proper working partnershipthe I ask honourable members to weigh careenterprise fully these Wordswe must expect unemployment to increase emrather than to diminish. Practical co-operation is surely within our reach. When terms of work have been mutually determined and agencies for adjusting grievances have been established, a'basis is laid down for that spirit of confidence and goodwill which make possible a focus of attention and energv upon work itself. This is the opinion of a man who, for the last two or three years, has had unusual facilities to see Australia as even honourable members have not seen it. Let me now quote the opinion of another man equally entitled to respect. I refer to Mr E. W. Buzacott, a large manufacturer, of Sydney, and a man very well known in the business world of Australia. I i i March of last year, Mr Buzacott, speaking at a world Rotary conference in Mr Baillieu Canberra, said- If the employer would take his people into explain his difficulties and his problems, and inform them that, with their he would be able to pay salaries and wages bearing some relation to the success his enterprise, this would create a feeling of contentment that would go far to solving our industrial problems. If we are to have a new spirit in industry the first step is for the employers to take their employees into their confidence. Whatever harm may be done by letting the employees know the facts about the business more harm is done by not letting them know. If employers refuse to take their employees into their confidence, they must expect the suspicion that the facts cannot bear the light of day. No one can doubt the value of that opinion. For half a century or more there has been an inherent suspicion in the minds of the workers all over the world that they are not getting a fair deal. Let us tell them the facts. In my opinion^ oneJialf of our industrial troubles is caused by the overwatering of stock. I know, because last month I received a cheque from a great industry in which I am interested, and I instead was reminded that the Commonwealth, by means of the super-tax, will claim about one-third of the amount which I received. My cheque represented an ordinary dividend of about 8 per cent., and a special dividend of 7 per cent., or, in all,. 15 per cent. But actually it represented a 30 per cent, dividend, because the stock had been watered to the extent of 100 per cent. I admit that this is far too great a return on the money actually invested; but in fairness to the company which returned me such a handsome dividend, I should say that its workmen are perfectly contented with their conditions of employment. They realise that they have continuous work, and I think they are well paid. Many of my friends have asked me if I should be content with a dividend of 8 per cent, on my capital investments, and my reply has invariably been, ""Lead me to it."" I have been striving for 25 or 30 years to get a bare 6 per cent., and I have not always been successful. Let us now return to America and inquire what is the position there. William Green who, as honourable members will recall, succeeded the late Mr. Samuel Gompers as President of the American Federation of Labour, expresses his views on industrial problems in the following terms:We arc seeking here to promote co-operation and harmony between employers and employed. We are accepting a given situation, and are dealing with facts as they are. The existing industrial system is a fact. We know that those who own factories and those who work in them are both dependent on industry, and that the enjoyments of life by the working man and of reasonable profits by the employer must alike come out of the industry. We believe that the success of industry depends on high wages and great production. With our high wagcB wo have succeeded in bringing about the most economical production of manufactured commodities in the world. And that notwithstanding the statement published in today's press that there are 3,700,000 persons unemployed in the United States of America. The statement continuesIn the Labour movement here we attach the utmost importance to efficiency in the working man, so that he can develop the maximum of productivity without over-working or over-exertion, and thus justify his high wages. Therefore, we are co-operating with the managements in the elimination of waste, because the working man suffers most of all as the result of waste. We are also co-operating with the managements in the elimination of duplication uf, effort, and we are not opposing the introductionof improved machinery, for QUIconviction is that if prosperity is to prevail the purchasing power of the worker must keep pace with the increasing power of productivity. The great mass of workers must buy back the things they produce. Of course they do; the people who make the goods must buy them back again.. That is why I am pleased that the Government is adopting the suggestion of the right honourable member. for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) and subsequently other members on the Government side to include the control of trade, commerce and corporations amoung the proposals to be submitted to the people. If I had more time at my disposal I should like to deal with the responsibility which rests upon us individually to assist in maintaining peace in industry. I have already dealt with the duty of the employers. I regretted the action of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) Mr - the n Attorney-General-in withdrawing the prosecution against the late Mr John Brown because, by that action, he tended to promote what we all regret, that is, industrial strife. We should all be very careful in such matters because they strike at the roots of British justice, and foster the suspicion in the minds of the workers that there is one law for the rich and one for the poor. Every one must be careful not to do anything which would be likely to lessen the respect of the workers for the law. The honourable mem campaign director for the Nationalist party in New South Wales during the recent federal elections. During the campaign that organization published faked photographs of myself-photograph s which originally represented a group, but from which. the figures of my wife, daughter, and three others had been taken out. Attached to his staff were two. others, Mr Dan. Douglas, Chairman of the Wentworth National Conference, and Mr Macarthur, a paid organizer of the National party. The honourable member for Warringah's organization even went so far as to publish in the press extracts from my private letters which I had written to these, gentlemen; letters headed "" Dear Mac"", and "" Dear Dan."", showing clearly that they were personal letters. Yet, in an attempt to defeat me, he and they stooped to that dirty trick.",40

118,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Hon.NormanMakin). - The honourable member has been dealing with the subject of industrial disputes in Australia, and the need for greater confidence between employers and employees. I understand that he has some connecting link between that subject and the matter which be has just brought forward. I certainly shall require him to connect his remarks with the subject before the Chair. I have allowed every one great liberty in approaching these jects, and I ask for the honourable member for Wentworth the same consideration as has been shown to others.",44
119,Mr MARRS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,I think the matters to which I have just been referring may be associated with the idea of industrial peace which forms part of the proposals before the Chair. The honourable member for Warringah attacked me in regard to some electric signs used during the election campaign. What a pity that before he gave utterance to his attack,44
120,Mr LATHAM,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,I rise to a point of order. I wish to inquire whether the fact that outside interests paid for the honourable member's electric signs has anything to do with the proposals now before the House.,44
121,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Wentworth. has hardly gone far enough yet for me to grasp the significance of what he is saying. _ The Leader of the Opposition may know more than I do.

Returning'"" for moment to the honourable member for Warringah, it is a pity that before launching his attack on me he did not find out that my money in payment for the signs was lying in the banking account of the company concerned long before the honourable member knew anything about the matter.",44
123,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Order ! The honourable member is going beyond the limits of the debate, and I ask him to confine himself to the subject before the Chair.",44
124,Mr MARRS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"I have said what I wished to say in regard to these measures. On the first proposal I cannot support the Government, but on the proposal for increased industrial powers I shall do so, sub- as well as ou that giving the Commonwealth power over trade and commerce. I shall do so mainly on the ground that these are national matters, ancl as such should be dealt with by the national Parliament. Debate (on motion by Mr. MCTIKRNAN) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. CUSTOMS TARIFF SCHEDULENATIONALIST ELECTIONEERING TACTICSWIRE-NETTING : RESTRAINT OF TRADE. Motion (by Mr THEODORE) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. ^ Mr LATHAM (Kooyong) [3.41] This morning honourable members were provided with a copy of a'proclamation containing certain tariff prohibitions. The importance of the step taken by the Government is obvious to honourable members and to the community as a whole, but owing to the way in which the matter has come before the House there will not in the ordinary course of events be any opportunity for discussing the details of the proclamation. One important consideration is the desirability of imposing a time limit on the duration of the proclaI rise now for the purpose of saying that the Opposition desires that an opportunity should be afforded next week of discussing the question of applying Honsuch a time limit. I wish to ask the coPrime Minister whether he is prepared to afford a reasonable opportunity next the week for this discussion. Of course, it is possible for the Opposition to force the position, and ensure a discussion, but it is not desired to do that, nor is it desired that we should await such an opportunity until after Easter. I do not ask that an opportunity should be provided to discuss the schedule item by item. When members of the Opposition spoke ou this subject yesterday they were unaware of the details of the schedule appearing in the proclamation'. obvious that the attitude of honourable members towards the Government's netion will be affected by the specific items included in the list. However, I do not ask for nn opportunity to discuss the items themselves, but merely to consider the imposition of a time limit regarding the operation of these unprecedented and drastic proposals.",44
125,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Warringah) [8.43] - During the course of his speech this afternoon the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) referred to me and my connection with.the federal election campaign in New South Wales. I am not greatly concerned with his views on the matter, bnt I have some little regard for the opinion of other honourable members of this House. In explanation, I wish to point out that, although I was campaign idireetor for the Nationalist party in New South Wales, I knew very little of the detailed organization in the various electorates. That is not part of the duties of a State campaign director, and the honourable member's statement this afternoon was the first I had heard of the matters to which he referred. That, in itself, indicates the extent of my connection with them. I did not know that ii uy such letters as he referred to had been published, and, if they were, the fact that I knew nothing of them is sufficient proof that I had nothing to do with them. Regarding the payment of the honourable member's election expenses by the film interests, I do not retract one word of what I have said. The truth of my statements has been established by irrefutable evidence to be found in the records of this House, and by the accounts dealing with the transaction. Such evidence cannot be contradicted.",45
126,Mr GBEGOEY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Swan) [8.451 - I support, the request of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), and, in addition, I point out in connection with the restrictions being imposed on trade thai there are certain business combinations operating in Australia. I drew attention many years ago to the position in the wire and wire-netting industry, and showed how the manufacturers had combined with the wholesalers and retailers in the sale of their products. I have a most important telegram before me bearing on It is this practice. I u view of the Prim* Minister's promise to endeavour to Bee that justice is done to the people, I shall hand the telegram to him. It rends as follows: The Prime Minister says restrictions must be placed nn those who import goods that can be Hindu in Australia. Would you reiterate that some steel merchants here are compelled to import because Australian manufacturers refuse to supply tliem at same rates and conditions as a few of their own pet distribution houses? We are the biggest importers litre and cannot obtain supplies. SWEKTHAN Co., PERTH. I believe that the smelters have an' arrangement with the wholesalers, but I do not know what the position is so far. as the retailers are concerned. I placed evidence before the Customs Department some years ago in connection with the operations of Mr MCDougall, of Ryland's wire and wire-netting works, and. I hope that action will be taken to see that their trading is open and straightforward. Mr SCULLEBr (Yarra-Prime Minister) [3.47] - In reply to the request of the Leader of the Opposition, I point out that next week we must first finish the consideration of the constitution alteration bills, and the Lands Tax Assessment Bill. The Leader of the Opposition realizes the urgency of those measures, which must take precedence over the matter mentioned by him-; but I shall be glad to have a discussion upon the aspect of the Government's tariff proposals that he has raised, because the Government has gives a good deal of thought to it, and still has an open mind upon it. An opportunity will be given next week to consider, it, when the other measures to which I have referred have been dealt with. The subject which the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) has mentioned will receive consideration. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.49 p.m.",45
