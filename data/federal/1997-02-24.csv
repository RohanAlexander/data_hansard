2,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the committee's report entitled enforcement in Australia: an international perspective, together with the evidence rethat ceived by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",13
3,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEES,"This report by the presentation committee is tabled in the context of the statutory function of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority which requires the committee in part-and quote from the act- 'to examine trends changes in criminal activities, practices and methods and report to both houses of the parliament any change which the committee thinks desirable to the functions, structure, powers and procedures of the authority.' I should say to the parliament briefly that the committee announced over the weekend a comprehensive national public inquiry into the NCA-in fact, a complete evaluation the National Crime Authority. The committee is looking forward to receiving submissions. That also will demonstrate this committee's commitment to its statutory task that the NCA is up to the very important task that it has been given of ensuring that there is an effective fight against organised criminal activity in Australia. The committee was privileged to meet with Mr Raymond Kendall, the Secretary General of Interpol. Interpol is a very important organisation to Australia. The internationalisathat tion of major criminal activity is a fact of and, therefore, Australia has to have a strong and vital involvement with other international crime fighting authorities, and Interpol very important one of those. I believe the NCA has been very successful at building bridges to the international community with other crime fighting organisaIt is respected internationally for its professionalism. As I was in the United States recently, I can report that it was very well regarded by both the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, both of which organisations I had meetings with. Report Interpol is important to Australia. At the moment we have not got representation on executive committee. Mr Kendall suggested it would be very desirable for us to do so and the committee recommends that the Law government take steps to ensure that Australia's interests are pushed forward and we do seek to have representation on that committee. I have got only a very short time for the of this report and I note that two of my colleagues-the deputy chairman of the committee, the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), and the Independent member for I Moore (Mr Filing)-wish to say a few words, and so I will leave it at that for now.",13
4,Mr SERCOMBE,COMMITTEES,"The tabling of this report by the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), the Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the NCA, is an appropriate occasion for the parliament to take note that, in the context of the globalisation of so many spheres of life that we as members of parliaof ment become increasingly aware of, the observation about globalisation is equally true of criminal activity and the environment in which Australian law enforcement organisaof ensuring tions need to operate. In that context, the visit to Australia of Mr Kendall, the head of Interpol, and the very helpful briefing that he gave to the committee towards the end of last year were a very important step. The chairman of the committee, Mr Bradford, has already referred to the very helpful suggestions that were made to meeting about the need for Australia to life have more direct and active involvement in international police matters, both on a world scale and in our own region. I think they are is a matters the government ought to take very much to heart. In the context of this debate I think it is worth referring to some of the words Mr Kendall used in his evidence. The transcript said: If you think the nature of the threatthat is, the threat of international criminal activityis as serious as I think it is, then your response must be the right level of response. I cannot see ... how at a political level, you can decide on a priority to deal with organised crime, drug traffickon ing and terrorism but then start cutting budgets all over the place. Those remarks are very appropriate to the performance of this government in relation to the National Crime Authority because the budget has been devastated since the government has been in office. It has been devastated particularly in regional centres of Australia, such as Adelaide and Perth, but across the country important areas such as surveillance activity have been very dramatically curtailed. I believe this government would be particularly well advised to take account of the words that Mr Kendall used, which reinforce the words that President Clinton used a few weeks before that in this chamber when he indicated the international importance of coordinated action between governments on these matters. It is simply not possible for this government to mouth the rhetoric, but then to slash budgets.",13
5,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"One issue I would like to raise which does impact on the Olympics in the year 2000 is the question of mutual assistance in our criminal matters. I would like to point out to the House that Mr Kendall, in response to a question I put to him about how the new amendments that were passed through this parliament recently in 1996 would affect the opportunity for better cooperation in criminal matters, observed that it is the principle of maximum exchange of information between law enforcement agencies that assists in detecting and being able to prevent serious criminal offences. I point out that we have the silly situation in Australia where, if there were an Oklahoma bombing in the United States again, the Australian Attorney-General as a result of legislation which passed through this House would be unable to exchange information were the offender apprehended and were the United States refusing to give an undertaking that it would not carry out the death penalty in relation to this particular offence. We would have the ridiculous situation where Australia would have to refuse to provide information that may lead to further investigation of these particular offences. This impacts our relationship with our regional neighbours, who of course are our partners in trying to fight against organised drug trafficking throughout our region. Anybody who thinks that Australia's drug problem is a serious problem-and I think most people should-should understand that we have, in fact, legislated in this place to impede our ability to fight against drug trafficking. That was legislation that passed through this House last year as a result of a bill presented by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), which I then attempted to amendunfortunately, unsuccessfully. All I can say is that when you consider Australia's role in the international law enforcement scene, particularly with the Olympics coming up in the year 2000, this type of legislation impedes Australia's participation in international law enforcement. I would like to congratulate Mr Kendall on an excellent presentation to our committee. He is a very distinguished police officer. He is the distinguished Secretary General of the Interpol organisation-the premier international criminal law enforcement and intelligence organisation in the world. It is an organisation that has an outstanding reputation, which has been rebuilt since its problems prior to and during the Second World War. It is in no small way down to the performance of Mr Kendall, as Secretary General, that the organisation now enjoys such an outstanding international reputation. It is a reputation that endures notwithstanding some of the peculiarities of some of its member nations-some of whom have enjoyed a rogue nation status in recent times-but it is something that the Interpol organisation has been able to overcome. I also would like to congratulate the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in organising for Mr Kendall's visit. I, too, would like to encourage Australia to support the candidacy of the Commissioner of the Federal Police as a member of the international executive of Interpol. It is an important step as far as Australia's role in our regional area is concerned. I can only urge the Attorney-General and the government to support wholeheartedly whatever overtures are necessary to ensure that the Commissioner of the Federal Police becomes a member of the international executive of Interpol.",14

Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee",15
9,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's reports entitled Papua New Guinea: Proceedings of a seminar, 11 and 12 November 1996, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received in the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",15
10,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"It is opportune that there is even a brief time to speak about Papua New Guinea in light of events that have come to note over the weekend. Last week Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) visited Papua New Guinea. Immediately on his departure it became apparent that they are apparently involved in what seemed nothing less than an extraordinary venturemore pertinent to a Frederick Forsyth novel, I suspect, than reality. There is involvement of a group called Executive Outcomes under their subsidiary Sandline International, with some 140-plus mercenaries. This will reputedly cost the government of Papua New Guinea something like $36 million for reported covert operations against the BRA in Bougainville. It had been my hope to perhaps move a motion at this time addressing the problems that I think beset both Australia and Papua New Guinea. I trust that the government of Sir Julius Chan takes note of what, I have little doubt, is a widespread concern within Australia at the character of this action. I hope Sir Julius and his ministers understand that, while we recognise their total independence as a sovereign state, affairs that occur in Papua New Guinea do impact on us here. There is a great concern about events of this sort that introduce into this region some of the worse aspects of African solutions which, tragically, have failed in everyone of the countries they have been pursued there. I would like to specifically say to Sir Julius, whom I know and respect, that I am very disappointed in the nature of this action. I trust that the reports can at least be eased by his deciding not to proceed with the employment of these covert mercenaries in the way that is reported. Report I wanted very briefly to refer to this report. It is five years since the original report Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea was tabled by the committee. It is only two years since the report Bougainville: a specific solution was tabled. This seminar was an update essentially of the former. In particular, I would like to thank the Papua New Guinea High Commissioner, Brigadier General Kenneth Noga, and Vice Admiral David Leach, President of the Australia Papua New Guinea Friendship Association, for their participation. I would also say to the other 100 persons who are involved with them-under the able chairmanship of my colleague, the chair of the foreign affairs subcommittee, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor)-that they are involved in a very worthwhile discussion on events not just on Bougainville but right across the whole field of PNG. It needs to be remembered again by the government of PNG that the more action that takes place on Bougainville the less regard is taken of the very real problem that extends right across the whole of the PNG economy. In fact, the seminar dealt with political and economic security and social and health issues. I have no time to go into the details, but the report itself does identify and produce 14 recommendations. In particular, there is one recommendation that I think the House needs to take note of. Recommendation No. 14 states: the Australian Government recognise the significance of Papua New Guinea in its foreign policy priorities and acknowledge through the maintenance of the AusAID and Defence Cooperation Programs the unique challenges that PNG faces ... in developing its infrastructure. We should express, particularly, our concern that the Bougainville crisis should be resolved peacefully. There is no prospect of a military solution to Bougainville and the government of PNG needs to recognise that. That conclusion was reached not just from the seminar but also from our earlier report on a peaceful solution in Bougainville. I spoke about the tragic assassination of Premier Theodore Miriung of the Bougainville transitional government only a fortnight ago. I identified the fact that attention has to be taken of the views of women and there has to be recognition of the recommendations of that peace conference in Arawa last year. I would like to see the timetable that we outlined in our report on a peaceful solution for Bougainville identified and pursued by the government of PNG and asserted by the government of Australia. On behalf of the committee, I give our thanks not only to the chair of that seminar, the honourable member for Groom, but also to the secretariat of the committee-in particular Margaret Swieringa, Jan Fuhrman and Cliff Lawson, who arranged that very sensible event and drafted the report.",15
11,Mr BRERETON,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to speak briefly on the tabling of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on its seminar into our relations with PNG. Once again, the joint committee and its very professional secretariat have produced a valuable document which should advance public understanding and debate on what is a very important aspect of our overseas relationships-in this case, a relationship which has unique breadth and depth, but which is also, as we have seen from today's headlines, a relationship with very significant tensions and difficulties, particularly in respect of the intractable conflict on Bougainville. Two weeks ago in the House, as the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has said, we unanimously adopted a motion that he moved concerning the tragic assassination of the Bougainville Premier, Theodore Miriung. That motion very appropriately urged the Government of Papua New Guinea and the members of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army to renew the reconciliation process; to end all human rights abuses; to restore the rule of law on the island; and to accelerate the urgently needed reconstruction process. It was only three days after that, on 13 February, that Foreign Minister Downer applauded the PNG government's support for a negotiated settlement on Bougainville by extending the mandate of the Bougainville transitional government, saying that he would use the opportunity of his forthcoming visit to PNG to pass on congratulations to Prime Minister Chan and other PNG ministers. On 19 February, the foreign minister followed up with a $4 million announcement of overseas aid funds to buy and distribute essential goods and medical supplies to the people of mainland Bougainville. These were very encouraging developments and the foreign minister's visit to Port Moresby should have marked a significant step forward. But what we now have to hand, of course, are these very disturbing reports that the PNG government is gearing up for another military offensive on Bougainville and this time bringing in foreign mercenaries-that is, professional freelance killers-to assassinate the very people the PNG government must talk to if there is to be a lasting peace settlement of the conflict. I know all members of this House would agree that this development casts a very grim pall over hopes for a peaceful settlement of this tragic conflict. As I said yesterday, all Australia is appalled by the gross abuses of human rights carried out by the PNG defence force troops on Bougainville. The employment of foreign troops in what amounts to a brutally conceived assassination plot will only exacerbate the conflict. It will deal a devastating blow to any prospect of peace. It will also set a very disturbing precedent for the use of foreign military forces in the South Pacific. Even if the planned operation does not proceed, great damage has already been donethe credibility of the PNG government is in tatters, as I fear is the peace process itself. The foreign minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have reportedly warned PNG against further military action on Bougainville. They must do so again in the strongest terms. Prime Minister Chan must be told directly and bluntly that the employment of foreign mercenaries will result in the immediate suspension of our bilateral defence cooperation program and a review of our aid program to PNG. Members will be aware that our overseas aid to PNG is the subject of a bilateral treaty and our defence cooperation is governed by a number of understandings and agreements. But if the PNG government decides to proceed with this crazy plan, then we should not hesitate in putting the fundamentals of the bilateral relationship right on the line. This murderous conspiracy that appears to have been floated is one quite beyond the pale and all Australian people will demand that we have no connection, however indirect, with it. Australia requires from the foreign minister a guarantee that not one dollar of Australia's bilateral aid to PNG is going directly or indirectly to the hiring of this of Rambo-like assassins. Finally, the report of the joint committee tabled today reaffirms the view that there can be no military solution to the conflict on Bougainville. It recommends that the Australian government encourage the PNG government to invite international observers, something we heartily endorse. I add that the Australian government should also press PNG to allow the international media access to Bougainville for, perhaps more than ever, the international spotlight must be shot on this appalling conflict. For too long the war on Bougainville has remained in the shadows. One positive thing that might emerge from this latest publicity is that the spotlight will be well and truly turned upon them.",16

13,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"Yes, Mr Speaker. I had considered widening the motion in view of the very serious developments in Papua New Guinea but I shall leave that and put it on the Notice Paper under private members business. I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted.",17

15,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Restrictions on the use of Blinding Laser Weapons and Landmines: 5th Report together with the minutes of proceedcrew ings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",17
16,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"The report I table today is a very important one, both domestically and internationally. It deals with two of the protocols of the inhumane weapons convention: protocol IV seeking to ban the use of blinding laser weapons and the amended protocol II dealing with antipersonnel landmines. The committee recommends early ratification of both protocols. Protocol IV to the convention seeks to prohibit the use of laser weapons, the purpose of which is to cause permanent blindness to unenhanced vision. These weapons are still being developed. During our inquiry, we were told that this is the first occasion since 1868 that there has been an attempt to ban a weapon before it has been used on the battlefield. The committee is pleased to be at the vanguard of such initiatives. Our attention was drawn also to some weaknesses in the protocol. We have therefore recommended that Australia take every opportunity to ensure that these are corrected to make the document, and indeed the prevention of the use of such weapons, more effective. The amended protocol II relates to the use on land of mines, booby traps and other devices. While landmines are a defensive weapon used by armies, demonstrably they can kill and maim innocent people, particularly children, long after a conflict has ended. The Australian government has been prominent in the international move towards a total global ban on the manufacture, use and transfer of these inhumane weapons. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) spoke at the disarmament conference in Geneva last month about the practical measures that the government supports to tackle the humanitarian disaster landmines cause. We have a proud record in undertaking humanitarian clearance operations via the Australian Defence Force and in looking after the victims of these weapons via our international aid agency. Stemming from a joint statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) last April, Australia has suspended the operational use of its landmines. That statement indicated that our stockpile of landmines would be retained 'in case of a substantial deterioration in our strategic circumstances'. We received persuasive evidence that to seek a total global ban on these awful weapons but, at the same time, retain the stockpile in its entirety could be hypocritical. The committee's view is that there is some substance in this argument. We have recommended therefore that Australia destroy its stockpile, except for a modest residual stock to ensure that the ADF retains a defensive capability to use landmines and including its important international humanitarian clearance operations. Two of our senatorial colleagues do not agree on this point and have submitted a dissenting report. We recommend also that Australia prepares a proposal when it attends the Ottawa conference later this year for creation of an agreed international timetable for the destruction of the landmines of all nations. Australia's international credibility will be enhanced as a result. Other recommendations deal with encouraging nations in our region to sign the inhumane weapons convention and all its protocols, the Department of Defence assuming responsibility for all aspects of humanitarian mine clearing operation, the Department of Defence encouraging designers of mine detection equipment and continued efforts by the government towards a total global ban on landmines. Unfortunately, in the limited time available, neither the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) nor I will be able to deal with all of the issues in this report, but we hope that it will be referred to the Main Committee where I am sure many honourable members inside and outside the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties will want to express their views. I am sure I speak for all committee members when I say that we hope that this report will assist towards the goal of a total global ban on landmines. We hope that our recommendations will make a further contribution to that end-in particular, a will to show the world that we have a genuine and leading role to playas a responsible, compassionate international player when it comes to the continuing tragedy of antipersonnel landmines right around the globe. I commend the report to the House.",17
17,Mr MCCLELLAND,COMMITTEES,"I congratulate members of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and, in particular, the member for Groom (Mr Taylor) for his leadership in this matter. I endorse wholeheartedly his comments. In terms of protocol IV and the use of laser blinding weapons, the Christian Blind Mission International Australia described the new technology as a 'new, indescribable, inexorable horror'. It certainly is that and this really is a historic opportunity, as the member for Groom has said, to be part of a move to ban the technology before it even hits the battlefield. Perhaps the more significant of the aspects covered in the report, however, is in respect of banning landmines. By the time this House adjourns today, there will be 30 people killed and 60 horribly maimed in the world as a result of landmines. Regrettably, they will more than likely be children. On pages 16 and 17 of the report, two very disturbing photographs are appropriately included to show the devastation that these mines cause to children. While the mines are designed to maim soldiers on the battlefield by, for example, amputating a leg, quite clearly the damage they do to children is far more severe. The photos reveal that those children are malnourished children living in Third World countries and, more than likely, would have entered the minefield to try to retrieve firewood or to assist their parents in agricultural ventures on the property. The mines themselves throw up debris and dirt and so forth and secondary infections are probably going to occur as a result of this dirt being embedded in the wounds. Quite simply, they cause horrific damage. Australia can be really proud of taking the lead in that we are recommending in the most significant of our recommendations that Australia destroy its stockpile except for essential training supplies. Australia already has a very proud record in the area. We have contributed about $24Yz million since 1991. Last year the minister announced an additional $12 million would be committed to programs in Cambodia over three years. Australia, it must be said, is leading the world in the technological development to locate and destroy landmines through the cooperation of the Defence, Science and Technology Organisation, CSIRO and private industry. But the reality is that, despite that sophistication, we still cannot locate those mines without metal being present. Again, Australia's initiative is shown in the respect that we are using not only this sophisticated metal detecting technology and radar but also a great Australian inhabitant and resource, namely, our dogs. Sniffer dogs are being used to locate mines. Australia is really leading the world in terms of its capacity to search and remove landmines. However, the task is horrendous. The United Nations estimates that it will take about 1,100 years and about $33 billion to remove landmines throughout the world. We can but make a start, but we can make a very substantial start in our own region. That is what this report is about. It is about Australia setting an example to the world. I sincerely trust that the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) will give it very careful consideration and adopt our recommendations.",18

21,Mr SPEAKER,DELEGA TION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the fifth annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, Vancouver, Canada, 710 January 1997. The report I have just presented records the outcomes of the fifth annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum held in Vancouver, Canada, in the period 7-10 January 1997. I had the honour of leading the Australian delegation, which included Senator Alan Eggleston and the honourable members for Moore (Mr Filing), Throsby (Mr Hollis) and Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson). At the outset, I want to thank delegation members for their strong contribution to debate during the meeting and for their participation in activities of the Executive Committee and the Drafting Committee. As with earlier meetings of the APPF, the Australian delegation strongly supported the APPF process, providing four discussion papers and draft resolutions in advance of meeting and participating in a wide range of plenary debates during the meeting itself. It is now more than five years since a preliminary meeting of parliamentarians from the Asia Pacific region was held here in Canberra in December 1991 to consider a concept proposed by the Hon. Yasuhiro Nakasone, a former and distinguished Prime Minister of Japan. Mr Nakasone's vision was to provide a loosely structured and nonexclusive forum for regional parliamentarians to meet on a regular basis to increase opportunities for dialogue and to add a further dimension to the existing framework of regional cooperation. The APPF was formally inaugurated in Tokyo in January 1993, with subsequent annual meetings being held in the Philippines, Mexico, Thailand and, most recently, Vancouver. I must acknowledge here the key roles played by my predecessors, the honourable members for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) and Cunningham (Mr Martin), in the establishment and development of the APPF in its early years. The fifth annual meeting of the APPF consolidated the significant advances made at the fourth annual meeting held in Thailand in January 1996. The APPF is now an increasingly important regional association with a strong corporate entity and an established of sound procedures and practices. The growing importance of the APPF and its loose association with the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping of economies indicate a continuing role of some significance for APPF. This is reflected in the breadth and depth of the regional vision statement adopted by the fifth annual meeting, the Vancouver Declaration, which is discussed in this report, and in the wide variety of subjects covered by the 18 resolutions adopted by the meeting. Among these were resolutions dealing with: the terrorist occupation of the Japanese Ambassador's residence in Lima; nuclear weapons; terrorism; anti-personnel mines; peace and stability on the Korean peninsula; APEC; trade liberalisation and APPF; AsiaEurope cooperation; environmental issues; human resource development; education and literacy; cultural exchange programs; youth the exchanges; human rights and the exploitation of children and women; illicit drugs and money laundering; and legislative exchanges and the Internet. The arrangements made by the Parliament of Canada for the fifth annual meeting were excellent and contributed significantly to the success of the meeting. The delegation was interested to note the strong support for the meeting from private sponsors as diverse as Canadian Airlines International and the Corel Corporation. The delegation was particularly impressed by the thoroughness of the administrative arrangements made by the Canadian conference secretariat and by the very skilful approach to chairing the meeting by the Canadian Chairman, Senator the Hon. Dan Hays. The delegation also records its appreciation to the Parliament of Canada for the warmth of the hospitality extended. The delegation would wish to express its appreciation for the strong support provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Parliamentary Library in the form of detailed written briefings on all agenda items, the preparation of discussion papers and draft resolutions before departure. Australia, a foundation member of the APPF Executive Committee, remains a memset ber of that committee until the next annual meeting of the APPF, scheduled to be held in Pusan, the Republic of Korea, in January 1998. This meeting will be preceded by a meeting of the Executive Committee in Seoul the in September of this year at which, among other issues, the question of the membership and means of election of the Executive Committee will be discussed. I believe that the APPF is an important regional forum, linking as it does legislators from 24 countries of the region who represent some 44 per cent of the world's population. I look forward to the continued support of the House for the APPF in the years ahead. I commend the report to the House.",19
22,Mr FILING,DELEGA TION REPORTS," Mr Speaker, you may recall that at the press conference of which you were a part at the conclusion of the proceedings there was a particularly searching question by one of the reporters involved in the press conference. He said, 'You've been talking for four days. What have you achieved?' I was interested to see the responses of the various delegation leaders, and it took only a few milliseconds for a response. The point is that at the conclusion of a conference of 24 countries, the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, none of the representatives of the countries that participated were in a situation of conflict. They were there talking about the issues that affected their regions and talking in a way that progressed them towards more cooperative and open arrangements within the region. The conference took place against the background scenario of the siege in Peru. The Peruvian delegation felt very strongly that they had to register an important point against the threat of international terrorism. The Peruvian delegation's contribution was a significant one. There was at that conference a strong and resolute stance taken in relation to the hostage taking, which continues, and the crisis that had at that stage arisen very rapidly at the Japanese embassy in Lima. At the conference I took a special interest in the question of illicit drugs, money laundering and international trafficking in illicit drugs. As a person with an interest in that particular area, I was interested in seeing how the conference would deal with an approach to international cooperation in the region. It was interesting to see that there was a common purpose in relation to drug trafficking that transcended political differences and, in some instances, quite strongly competing economic interests. This was because of the nature of the threat of international in drugs, particularly in relation to the developing countries in our region. This is a threat not only in terms of human costs-in relation to the social effects of drug trafficking and consumption by people in particular countries in our region-but also in terms of the economic effect. Drug trafficking, the ancillary corruption of officials and the enormous amount of illicit funds generated by the drug trafficking industry skew economic activity. It provides some very important challenges to all the countries in the region---challenges that may well reflect on an individual nation's particular direction or determination to in fact arrest the growth of international drug trafficking. I make an observation that I made earlier this afternoon in relation to Australia's own position-a position that is, in my view, exacerbated by the passing of legislation in 1996 which effectively prevents Australia from fully participating in cooperative efforts in relation to criminal law enforcement, particularly in drug trafficking. It turns out that Australia's own legislation, passed in this place last year, provides for the Attorney General to be required to refuse to exchange information with a country that has arrested or apprehended a suspect in relation to an offence that carries the death penalty. Australia is obliged to refuse to provide information that may be held by Australian authorities unless that country gives an undertaking that the penalty would not be carried out. (Time expired)",21
23,Mr HOLLIS,DELEGA TION REPORTS,"I was pleased to participate in this important conference in Canada. As other speakers have mentioned, the conference was held against the background of the unfortunate situation at the Japanese embassy in Lima, Peru. All the delegates were very aware of this as were, of course, the delegates from Peru. Indeed, one of the Peruvian delegates had been at the embassy earlier that evening and had just left. Had he not left when he did, he could well still be in that building. That was a very salient reminder to us-with the Peruvian delegation there and with the resolution being passed about terrorism. But it really did bring trafficking it home to us all very much. I particularly congratulate the leader of the delegation, the Speaker of the parliament. I thought he very ably led the delegation. We did not have a lot of time to prepare for it because it was announced just before the House rose. We missed out on some of the briefings and meetings usually held before overseas delegations. That was more than amply made up for by the extensive briefing papers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I also congratulate the delegation secretary, Peter Gibson, and indeed the Clerk of the House, who also assisted. All these people made a very valuable contribution, as did all members of the delegation. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) was a little modest in his presentation. He made a very significant presentation on an issue I know he feels very strongly about. I have heard him speak about this issue before in the chamber. He made a significant contribution on the subject of drug trafficking and money laundering. I shared a table with the honourable member for Moore, and a Canadian mountie was there who was also involved in this area. They had a very interesting exchange, brought about by the significant contribution of the member for Moore. My contribution was on human rights, which I suppose is not surprising to people in this House because I seem to speak on that almost as much as I do on shipping. I do not know if my contribution was as meaningful as that of the member for Moore; nevertheless, it is on the public record there and it was a contribution I was pleased to make. I would also like to comment on the hospitality of the hosts. The conference was held in the beautiful city of Vancouver. They tell me it is ringed by mountains, but unfortunately we did not see them because all the time we were there the beautiful mountains were shrouded in fog.

25,Mr ANDREW,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (I) recognises the difficulties being faced by the citrus industry as a result of the importation of subsidised Brazilian orange juice; (2) recognises the value of pure citrus juice as a food product and therefore calls on the Government to reconsider the imposition of a sales tax on 100% Australian orange juice; and (3) seeks a formal assessment of the legality under the World Trade Organisation rules of relaxing the present sales tax arrangements on 100% orange juice. My role in moving this motion today is not in any sense to polarise the parliament. I would hope that the members for Hunter e Mr Fitzgibbon) and Lyons e Mr Adams) resist any temptation they might be feeling to polarise the parliament in this debate, for this is not a debate about apportioning blame. I would remind the members for Hunter and Lyons, relatively new members that they are, that the Liberal and National parties in opposition supported the government when it was doing for the citrus industry precisely what the now government is doing for the citrus industry. A similar approach from them as was exercised by us in opposition would be very constructive in dealing with the problems of the citrus industry in respect of tariff debates and of trade generally. The issue concerning the citrus industrycovered on the Notice Paper in my namereflects what has been a recurring problem for this industry over the past two decades, more pronounced over the past five years. It would be quite wrong for any speaker in this debate to generalise about the citrus industry and imply that the citrus industry in Australia was in trouble when it is not. I would hope that everyone in this chamber is familiar, as the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) and I am, with the simple fact that, if you are a citrus grower growing navel oranges in Australia in 1997, you have a product currently in such demand in export markets that there are people offering valencias as part of a navel orange contract in order to soak up the valencia part of the industry. The navel industry is running reasonably well; the mandarin industry is running reasonably well. The lemon industry has all sorts of new trade opportunities in Japan, thanks to the arrangements we have under the World Trade Organisation. The grapefruit industry has long had difficulties because of varietal problems. But the focus of this motion is on the valencia section of the citrus industry. The difficulty for every valencia grower-and valencias, after all, make up a large portion the Australian crop-is that valencias are a premium juice fruit. In the production of juice Australian growers are beaten by Brazilians every time. It is not because we are not as good as they are but because we live in a very dry country and we choose, particularly in the electorates of Riverina and Wakefield, to take a scarce resource called water, divert it by irrigation onto carefully tended groves and produce an article that looks delectable, and it is madness to then run that article through a machine so that nobody sees it. The Brazilians, un the other hand, grow their juice fruit in jungle-like situations because, while it does not look good, all they want is the internal material for juice. The focus for the valencia industry, once a juice focus, now has to be an export product focus. The focus for the valencia industry has to be like the focus for the navel industrytaking whole fruit that has been grown in an ideal human generated environment with irrigation, placing it in cartons and making it available as whole fruit around the globe. The parliament recognised that problem and last time the Brazilian price fell the parliament and the government of the day-then the ALP-responded by refusing all of the industry requests for tariff protection and for sales tax changes and instead offering $9 million as a citrus market development package to open up export markets for whole fruit. government have picked up precisely the same challenge and continue precisely the same program. And this has been successful. Wherever you look across the valencia producing sectors of Australia, the proportion of whole fruit going into cartons and being exported as if it were apples or pears has increased. Growers have responded by improving fruit quality. But since November last year there has been a collapse in the Brazilian juice price and the relatively high proportion of Australian valencia material still being sold as juice has meant that valencia growers are finding it hard to make ends meet in the face of a collapsed Brazilian price. There are solutions being proposed by the industry. The industry has come to the government calling for what they have called of a varietal rework program-the removal of some valencia trees, allowing them to be replaced by navels, by mandarins or by other emerging varieties of citrus fruit. That could well be an appropriate direction for the government to take. In fact, the only concern that the government and the industry have right now is that there has been an automatic removal of valencia trees, particularly in the electorates of the member for Riverina, the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) and in my electorate. Many of those valencia groves have been removed and wine grapes have taken their place. We have a concern that the level of valencia production in Australia may be falling to the point at which it is no longer as viable for us to have a juice industry. I have to say in defence of most of the citrus growers-unfortunately, perhaps inevitably; not all of them-that there has not been a troglodyte-like call for a return to higher levels of tariff protection. Most growers recognise that the tariff course we have taken is, firstly, irreversible and has been taken by the parliament, not by the government or the opposition; and, secondly, our adherence to the obligations that we have under the WTO has given all sorts of market opportunities and market access that would otherwise have been denied us. The capacity, for example, of navel growers within the citrus industry to sell citrus fruit into the United States market, now We in the most lucrative market available to our navel growers, would not exist if it were not for our adherence to the WTO rules. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are aware, I have moved: That this House: (I) recognises the difficulties being faced by the citrus industry as a result of the importation of subsidised Brazilian orange juice. I am sure that members of the chamber recognise these difficulties. I trust that, as a result of this debate, other members who are not as familiar with this issue will become more familiar with it. I have also moved that this House: (2) recognises the value of pure citrus juice as a food product and therefore ask the Government to reconsider the imposition of a sales tax on 100% Australian orange juice. Or, as the industry insisted on me adding, 'not from concentrate product' - pure juice product.' This is an issue that I was pursuing jointly with former parliamentary secretary, Senator Nick Sherry. Both government and opposition have run into the same difficulty of determining precisely what is a food product. The difficulty we face is that while orange juice is distinctly the same as white milk-in other words, a pure product, and white milk has no sales tax on it and 100 per cent orange juice has a 10 per cent sales tax on it-the reality is that most white milk is not consumed as a beverage but consumed as a cooking item. It is used in custard, porridge, cereals or whatever whereas orange juice of similar food value tends to be consumed as a beverage. This differential has posed a problem for the parliament. It is a challenge that the government faces to look again at the way in which sales tax is applied and to revamp the entire taxation system. Finally, I have moved that this House: (3) seeks a formal assessment of the legality under the World Trade Organisation rules of relaxing the present sales tax arrangements on 100% orange juice. Or, as the industry prefers to say, 'not from concentrate orange juice'. I understand the industry's enthusiasm for a relaxation of the sales tax rules on what we will call pure fruit juice as compared with concentrate. Their challenge may well be WTO legal. After all, we are not preventing anybody from bringing pure product into Australia; we are merely seeking a differential - alcs tax on imported concentrate product or loc,' 1 concentrate product and having that taxed lone rate and pure fruit juice product, imported or local, taxed at another rate. I think it is a reasonable request. Having raised it with the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer), I have to concede that, when the Japanese sought to have a differential sales tax applied on Canadian whiskey, as opposed to their local sushi, they ran into problems under the like trade arrangements. I would, however, ask the Minister for Trade to look again at this request since the industry is calling for the sales tax on pure fruit juice product to be differential from the sales tax on concentrated fruit juice product, regardless of the origin. In that sense, it is seeking not to be seen as a trade disincentive because, regardless of the origin, the two products will be treated at a differential rate. If such a decision were possible-I am asking for assessment of it-it need not cost the Treasurer or the government anything in sales tax revenue because additional sales tax could be derived from a higher tax on a concentrated product and this could be used to open up the desperately needed export markets. (Time expired)",22
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Hicks-I second the motion.,24
27,Mr ADAMS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"It is with some sympathy that I rise to support the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and his motion concerning some of the difficulties that are facing the citrus industry. He outlined quite well the history that had been encountered by the citrus industry during the previous government's time in office in trying to get more of a focus on the export side of things as opposed to a heavily protected industry through a tariff on concentrate type juice in particular. I have some sympathy for the honourable member's motion calling for an assessment of the imposition of a sales tax on orange juice. I think that the government should look at that with some sympathy. I take the words that the industry wants to use-not concentrate but a pure orange juice being sold in Australia, presently receiving sales tax of 10 per cent, as opposed to a concentrated powder, which is brought into our country and then manufactured into a drink and sold in competition with other drinks as compared with a freshly produced pure orange juice being sold in the local market. I think there should be a differential there. I would support something along the same lines with apple juice. The apple juice industry could also benefit from some sort of recognition in that area. It is certainly something that we should investigate. I am very pleased about what the member said in relation to the export side of this business. It is now taking off and we are exporting a lot more high quality oranges and trying to compete against South America with concentrate. I understand it is very difficultwhen we produce and grow oranges we use a lot of irrigated water, which is costly and labour intensive-to compete against people like the Brazilians who grow oranges in a climate of great warmth and a lot of rain. Their oranges can grow in a very primitive state, if I can use that term, and they do not have to use the amount of irrigated water that we would use in Australia. Trying to compete against the natural advantages of Brazil, we in Australia are better able to compete on getting that orange which we grow very well-it is a high grade product-into an export market situation and gain added value from that. We are doing that with bananas. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I am sure you would be well up on what is happening in the banana industry. I passed through your electorate some weeks ago. I am sure that you are on the same bandwagon of getting high quality export bananas from Australia into the export world. When we are looking at these sorts of issues and, as this motion has touched on, the experience of AQIS in fresh foods entering Australia, we should consider the pressure put on us by imported products that could and do pose a threat of disease to our own local product. We have been involved in several of those in recent times, one being the salmon industry and now the apple and pear industry, which is very fearful of the fire blight disease, and rightfully so, coming into Australia. Open access of that sort of product into Australia could prove very costly to us as a country and could also prove very costly to regional areas in our country. A lot of these issues go to-and the member for Wakefield is well aware of this-regional Australia because that is where we manufacture these products, that is where we grow these products and employment opportunities in regional Australia come from these products. We need to give a lot of emphasis to that. We also need to get decision makers to recognise that the Australian regional centres are about these industries and the added value of them. They are certainly affected in a great way by the reduction of tariffs and we need to be mindful of that. I have seen people around the country starting to take issue with the continued pace of tariff reduction. I think we should be waiting until our competitors are on a more even keel with us before we actually continue to race down that hill and pull tariffs back down. In the Weekend Australian, reporters Sid Marris and Natasha Bita covered the story of a rally in Geelong where 3,000 or 4,000 people turned out to oppose the continuing reduction of tariffs in the car industry and the footwear and clothing industry. I think people in regional Australia are starting to show their basic concern that, as we continue to race down the hill of pulling down tariffs without tying them to the reduction of our competitors, regional Australia is going to be damaged even more than it has been damaged in recent years. We have to tie our policies and get a link between cabinet decisions and government decisions, and also at a state level, to regional Australia and the effect they have on regional Australia. You have only to look at the unemployment figures through all age groups--especially youth in regional Australia-to see the devastating impact that unemployment is having out there. Of course, I could mention the cuts to government programs and how they are also affecting that side of regional Australia, but I will resist the temptation because it does not line up as No. 4 on the member for Wakefield's motion. Btl maybe it should since his mUdon highlights some of the difficulties within the citrus industry that is located in regional Australia and plays an important part in regional Australia. Another issue that comes out of this motion is that there is a need for a lot more knowledge about the World Trade Organisation, our new arrangements under the protocols, environmental issues and everything else that deals with the World Trade Organisation. I think there needs to be a lot more knowledge dispersed throughout regional Australia about the new era. That is not being critical of the farmers organisations in Australia, but there seems to be a lack of understanding in some regional areas of where the world is in 1997 as opposed to maybe 1957. There is certainly a basic need to pursue more knowledge about the World Trade Organisation and to get a basic understanding about where we are heading in trying to become more export oriented in many of our industries. This motion gives us the opportunity to recognise that the government should reconsider the imposition of sales tax on 100 per cent Australian orange juice, which is taxed at a rate of 10 per cent. We need to get government to look at that. (Time expired)",24
28,Mr HICKS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"In rising to support the motion introduced by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), I acknowledge the experience he has had as a citrus grower in the Riverland district, which, along with Sunraysia and the Riverina, is one of Australia's major producers of citrus. The member for Wakefield has already touched on the problems Australian citrus growers are facing as a result of imports of low priced, mainly Brazilian, frozen concentrated orange juice, which is driving the costs of local citrus down to a level that puts the livelihood of many citrus growers at risk. I am sorry that I have only a short time to support the member for Wakefield and that my colleague the member for MalIee, Mr John Forrest, who is a strong advocate for the citrus industry, is unable to speak on this issue today. Because of the reasons raised by the member for Wakefield, the typical example of the situation facing growers in the Riverina is being experienced by my friend John. Recently, he had 2.56 tonnes of oranges picked, for which his gross earnings were $179.20. These oranges cost $128 to harvest and levies cost $21.76. This left a total profit of $29.44, or $11.50 a tonne. This $11.50 a tonne is to pay all the associated costs of farming, including water, power, fertiliser and a myriad of other costs. So the precarious situation being faced by John and many of his citrus growing colleagues can be seen. Given the advantage of the Brazilian citrus producers, particularly in relation to vast plantations, cheap labour costs and climatic advantage, while ever frozen concentrated orange juice is imported into Australia and we continue to comply with our commitments to the World Trade Organisation obligations as a trading nation, the situation for citrus growers in the short term is going to be difficult. However, in recent times the industry has moved towards increased exports of fresh oranges and the production of freshly squeezed orange juice. Great strides have been made in those areas by an industry that has been disadvantaged by the GAIT round. As you could imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, those federal parliamentarians representing citrus growing areas have continued to bring the message to Canberra and have worked with industry and government to find a way to ensure the industry's viability. In their tum, representatives of the citrus industry have been very strong in their advocacy. The President of the Australian Citrus Growers Michael Crook, believes the citrus industr; has been under attack from Canberra for something like 10 years, while governments prematurely reduce tariffs and fiddle with sales tax and labelling regulations in an apparent vendetta aimed at killing off the industry and making it almost impossible for consumers to identify Australian product. Ron Calibria, the President of the Griffith and District Citrus Growers, has reminded the government that returns to growers have dropped to as low as $30 per tonne. He has blamed Canberra's unrealistic speedy push for free trade and minimum protection levels which he believes have crippled a large sector of the vibrant citrus industry. While the government's hands appeared to be tied in a number of areas because of our obligations under the World Trade Organisation, one suggestion mooted for some time is to have freshly squeezed orange-that is, not from concentrate juice-rightly reclassified as a food, which will then make it tax free and more competitive on the supermarket shelf. The present tax regime appears to be unfair, given that items like milk, coffee and tea are not taxed and are classified as foods. The sales tax on freshly squeezed orange juice-that is, not from concentrate-is not consistent with the many thousands of tonnes of fresh oranges being squeezed with in-store juicing machines in retail stores for which consumers pay no tax. I do not believe they should pay tax, but neither should there be a tax on any not from concentrate freshly squeezed orange juice, whether processed in a retail shop or in a large commercial operation. Over recent years and under strong local and national leadership, the citrus industry read the signals and is moving to readjust the industry. Plans like Kick-start Sunraysia, which could be a blueprint for other citrus growing regions, can be a good initiative. The rebudding of trees to more suitable varieties will be of limited help because of the complexity of the seasonable markets and the supply and demand situation for the two main varieties of oranges. The growth of an export fresh fruit market is developing, as is the growth of the freshly squeezed orange juice market, and this is the main light at the end of the tunnel. However, the industry needs time for these adjustments to have effect. It is believed within the industry that the best way to assist at this time is to remove altogether the tax on fresh frozen orange juice-that is, not from concentrate orange juice. I, along with the member for Wakefield and the member for Mallee, ask the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the government to heed these suggestions in order to help the industry in the long term to be less severely affected by cheap imports and, at this stage, to help support the citrus industry in the Riverina and elsewhere.",26
29,Mr FITZGIBBON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I must say that there isn't anything better for the soul than to come into this place and be able to join with members of my own political party, such as the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), and members of the Liberal and National parties in defending an industry which is so important to regional Australia and which provides so many jobs in regional Australia and so much export income for this country. I am always delighted to follow the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) in this place in any debate because, while I will not give him 100 per cent, at least 90 per cent of the time he makes quite a deal of sense. He has recognised, quite justifiably, that this is an industry in trouble. The recent significant reductions in the tariff rates and the compounding problem associated with the appreciation of the dollar, the abolition of the sales tax differential and the developing country status has afforded to countries like Brazil make things very tough for this industry. That is why I am happy, conditionally at least, to accept his invitation not to politicise this particular motion and, instead, lend my support to it. It is certainly a motion worthy of support. It is also a responsible motion. It does no more than ask the government to take a look at some quite legitimate opportunities available to us under the World Trade Organisation's rules. None of us in this place would oppose part (1) of the motion, which simply asks us to recognise the difficulties facing the industry as a result of the importation of subsidised Brazilian orange juice. Part (2) seeks to have us recognise the value of pure citrus juice as a food product. None of us on this side have any trouble with that, as the member for Lyons has said. Part (3), to which I have already alluded, seeks a formal assessment of the legality under the World Trade Organisation rules of relaxing the present sales tax arrangements on 100 per cent orange juice. I said that I conditionally accept the invitation of the member for Wakefield to enter this debate in a way which is in the spirit of his intentions. I also say that it is delightful to see members of the National Party and the Liberal Party representing regional Australia come in here and join with us in defence of regional Australia, because they have been a little lacking over the last 12 months. I and others on this side of the House have raised a number of issues which have been of great concern to those of us representing regional Australia. While I have probably said it a hundred times, I have to rank on top of the list the abolition of the division of regionpoultry al development and the subsequent statement of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) that he did not believe the federal government had any real role to play in the area of regional development. I want to draw an analogy with another issue that I have been particularly pursuing in this place: the importation of cooked chicken meat. There is a very real analogy to be drawn here. The member for Wakefield is not seeking to suggest that the walls go back up-not at all. I kllow that he is far too responsible to do that. What he is saying is that there are legitimate mechanisms under the World Trade Organisation rules which allow us to provide for the citrus industry special consideration and special benefits. He does not want to oppose the World Trade Organisation or the benefits that flow from it; he wants to take what is rightly the industry's. That is fair enough. With chicken it is exactly the same. We on this side recognise the benefits of the WTO, but we also say that there is another legitimate mechanism, and that is the quarantine mechanism which allows us to deny the importation of chicken meat.",27
30,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Order! It being 1.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA B1acktown and District Agricultural",28
31,Mr MOSSFIELD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On Saturday 22 February, my wife, Jan, and I had the pleasure of attending the official opening of the 74th annual BIacktown and District Agricultural Show in my electorate of Greenway. This show is a direct link between the agricultural past of the district and the modem urban residential area it is today. The show allows the current younger residents to reflect on the history of the district. The three-day program contained the usual events of cattle, horse and judging, sheep shearing demonstrations and wood chopping events. The occasion gave me the opportunity of meeting some of the long-time residents of the district such as Trevor Thorn, who for 67 years ran a retail dairy in the area. Trevor sold his dairy only last year. It was also a pleasure to meet the 11 finalists in the BIacktown Showgirl competition. All of these young ladies are fine ambassadors for the district. I would congratulate particularly the winner of the showgirl competition, Stacey Anne Byrt, and the runner-up, Amanda Flissinger, on their success. I would also congratulate Barney Gallen, the show committee president, and Beryl Luck, the committee secretary, and their committee on a job well done. Barney Gallen has been the show president for 27 years. It is no doubt through Barney's hard work and just commitment that the show has been so successful over such a long period, even with the urbanisation of the district. Teenagers: Behaviour",28
32,Mrs WEST,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Over the last two weeks my electorate of Bowman has been under siege-not from gun toting rambos hell bent on destruction but from 16to 18-yearold school students hell bent on destruction. This may be a slight exaggeration, but to many in my electorate this is how it appears. In the last two weeks the residents of Bowman have witnessed two events which, at best, would be described as 'disturbances' and, at worse, 'riots'. Both stemmed from birthday parties at which the parents were not present. At one such party the 18-year-old birthday boy paid his parents $100 to get out Show of the house for the night. The resulting party saw over 300 drunken and sometimes abusive youths running riot through the streets of a normally quiet suburban neighbourhood. scenario was replayed in Wynnum just a week later, and again the parents were nowhere be seen. I do not blame these youths for their behaviour-after all, it would appear that the parents condone it. As a former teacher I have witnessed first-hand the gradual decline in family standards and parental control, all of which occurred under the former 'give 'em what they want' administration. Is it any wonder that parents feel disempowered to discipline their siblings when a former government paid siblings to leave home when things got a bit tough? We need to give back to these parents the authority which has been stripped away. no Parents need help, and I believe that it is to this government to provide that help. On positive note, supportive parenting programs designed to alert parents of teenagers on how best to deal with these turbulent years are available and are being used by some schools in my electorate to address this very real need. (Time expired) A valon Air Show",28
33,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I draw the attention of the House to the outstanding air show held at Avalon over the last few days. The air show was attended by 180,000 visitors both during the trade days and the last two days which were open to the public. There were 430 exhibitors, which indicates the strength and depth of this particular air show. With 28 countries being represented, Australia was able to put on a very good face for the international aviation industry with this excellent air show at Avalon. There were 600 planes that participated the show and some of the displays were with outstanding. Reports which have come to me-apart from any I could make based upon my own attendance-are that those members of the public who visited the show enjoyed the whole spectacle. The direct benefit to Vicon toria of this air show was some $45 million. I place on the public record the tremendous enthusiasm of Chief Executive and his board who have worked so hard over the last two years to make sure that the This Avalon Air Show Downunder has been a first-class event, internationally recognisable. to I wish them well for their next Avalon Air Show in two years time. Netball Australia",29
34,Mr MARTIN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last week I had the opportunity to attend two functions involving Netball Australia. The first of those was the announcement of a brand new sponsorship for Netball Australia and the institution of the Commonwealth Bank Trophy where eight teams from around this country will play in the highest standard of women's netball yet seen. Of course, the Australian netball team is the world champion, and the fact that they have succeeded in small measure I think is due to the untiring up work of Sue Taylor, the national president, a and Pam Smith, the chief executive officer. The Commonwealth Bank is to be congratulated for the new sponsorship because, in terms of value of sponsorship of women's sport in this country's history, it is the highest. I think that says something about the fact that at last we are getting recognition of other sports, other than the traditional ones. I would also like to commend the ABC for their decision to continue the televising of both the Commonwealth Bank Trophy matches and test matches involving the Australian women's netball team. I look forward to a continuing close association with that group in the coming years. Telecommunications Tower: Berkshire Park Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay)-I rise today to bring attention to the plight or the problem of Mrs Vaby in my electorate. She in is a resident of Berkshire Park and, along other residents of Berkshire Park, she is most concerned about a telecom tower that is to be located in the backyards of those residences. Telstra has been offered one alternative site in the Castlereagh forest and another a toxic waste site. The tower can be easily constructed to a greater height to accommodate any difference in changing the site that Ian Honnery Telstra has selected. Telstra have used a lot of standover tactics in their dealings with Mrs Vaby, telling her they will arrange one last public meeting with her and that will be the last meeting-meaning, in effect, that the residents of Berkshire Park do not have a say in the operations of Telstra. It is not as if Telstra has done western Sydney any great favours with the SID rates that we have to pay in western Sydney. We have long memories out there. If Telstra keeps up these tactics, I am sure that Mrs Vaby, the residents of Berkshire Park and the rest of us in the electorate of Lindsay will tum to Optus, Vodafone or some other carrier to provide us with the services that Telstra has hitherto been providing. Obviously it is a case of bringing consumer power to bear. I seek to have Telstra reconsider their siting of the tower and look at some less visually obtrusive and less habitated areas of the electorate to site this really unsightly tower. Evandale: Penny-Farthing Races",29
35,Mr ADAMS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to mention an event which took place in my electorate at the weekend. I was able to officiate at the penny-farthing annual bike races that occur in the township of Evandale, just south of the Launceston airport. Evandale is a very historical town. Mr Speaker, I do not know if you remember penny-farthings-I know that you have got some age on the rest of the House-but penny-farthings are an old fashioned form of transport that is great fun. In recent years we have had races between Launceston and Hobart. This distance takes two hours in a car, so you can see that the people who take this on are great enthusiasts. People from all over the world come to Tasmania because of this bike race. There is always an American contingent which confronts us. They take the opportunity of particithe pating in the slow race. Going slow on a penny-farthing can have its difficulties. There are also the slaloms in and out of the witches hats and, of course, there is a race around the streets of Evandale in a full capacity, as fast as you can go. In the town of Evandale there is also a history of bicycles. They take the historical aspects very seriously. Anybody seeking information about penny-farthings could certainly gain some information from this township. I recommend the penny-farthing racing in Evandale to anyone in the future. The racing at Evandale is a credit to the small local committee that puts it on to promote their town. I recommend the penny-farthing racing at Evandale to anyone in the country who wishes to see something unique. (Time expired) Murray-Darling Basin Commission: Visit to the Electorate of Wakefield",30
36,Mr ANDREW,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to take this opportunity to report to the House on a visit to my electorate last week by members of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, including the state ministers involved and the commissioners. I would like to commend the Chief Executive Officer of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, Mr Blackmore, and the President, Professor Lovering, for the program they put together and for the present management of the basin. It has been relatively easy to be critical of the Murray-Darling Basin. Too few people recognise the improvements that have occurred both in basin management and water quality, particularly over the last decade-an improvement that will be further enhanced by the allocation of moneys from the one-third sale of Telstra. While visiting my electorate, the commission was alerted to the evaporation basin at Loveday. The evaporation basin at Loveday is a collection of drainage water coming out of the Loveday irrigation area. What was brought to the particular attention of the commission members was the change that occurs in evaporation basins when they are properly monitored, and the relatively low outflow of drainage water that results from the rehabilitation of irrigation areas. Five of government irrigation areas in South Australia have been rehabilitated. and drainage from them has ceased to be a problem. In fact, there is now a call for the rehabilitation of the Loxton irrigation area. This is the only irrigation area in which the Commonwealth has a direct monitoring interest, because it was set up under the old War Service Land Settlement Act. I would remind the government particularly of the urgency of proceeding with the rehabilitation of the Loxton irrigation area. It remains one of those irrigation areas currently offering a real saline flow to the Murray Basin: the sort of saline flow that ought to be addressed, the sort of saline flow that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission is very conscious of and the sort of saline flow that is currently being monitored in the investigation of the Loveday evaporation basin by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. Sports Scholarships: Namadgi",30
37,Ms ELLIS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Today it gives me pleasure to bring to the attention of the House an initiative in my electorate of which I am particularly proud. On Saturday evening I had the opportunity to attend a function at the Tuggeranong Vikings Rugby Union Club at Erindale where quite a bit of money was handed out by this licensed club to young people who are students in my electorate in the form of sports scholarships. These young people are showing a very strong indication that they have a particular flair for sport. The club awarded them $1,000 each to assist them with additional costs in the coming year. This club has been doing this for some years. Over recent years almost $1,4 million has been handed out by the Tuggeranong Vikings Rugby Union Club to people within the electorate who have involved themselves in amateur sport. It was, indeed, also a pleasure to share the table at which I was sitting with Dawn Fraser-obviously a very well known sporting person in this country. Dawn Fraser had a terrific opportunity on Saturday night to commend these young people and give them a great pointer as to the sorts of experiences that they can expect should they have the opportunity to represent their country or their territory in elite sport in the future. I very strongly commend the role of the Tuggeranong Vikings Rugby Union Club and similar clubs in Canberra. They have a wonderful opportunity to tum money earned from this community back into the community at a terrific community level. I commend the club greatly for the actions they perform. Beef Industry",31
38,Mr BOB BALDWIN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Today I need to bring to the attention of this House the antics of the state New South Wales Labor government-friends and colleagues of the Right over there-in what they have done to the beef industry in regional and rural Australia. It was been gazetted that the regulation pertaining to the Prompt Payments Act will be repealed by the state government. This will mean that the process by which all meat is sold at auction-an auction process where normally people would be paid within 24 hours-will now be removed. In other words, the state Labor government wants the beef industry to be the ATM of the big processors. If the people on that side over there are genuinely concerned about regional and rural Australia, as the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) say they are, we need to see them approach their mates in the state Labor government of New South Wales and appeal to them to reinstall this regulation-the regulation that guarantees that our farmers can at least keep going a little longer. They take their beef to the markets at the time when the beef is at the fatter stage to attract dollars",31
39,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2.00 p.m., in accordance with standing order 106A, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Deng Xiaoping",31
40,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That this House records its sincere regret at the death on 19 February 1997 of Deng Xiaoping, the former paramount leader of China, and expresses its sympathy to the government and the people of China and to his family in their bereavement. Deng Xiaoping, one of China's most significant leaders, died on 19 February at the age of 93. As China's paramount leader for nearly two decades, Deng presided over one of the longest periods of stable government China has experienced since the middle of the 19th century. He was the central force behind the reform, modernisation and reorientation of China' s economy in market directions. He was the chief architect of the dynamic growth which over the past 15 years has undeniably transformed China. This growth has given its people living standards unparalleled in its modern history. It has far-reaching consequences for the Asia-Pacific region and for the entire world. Deng Xiaoping was largely responsible for bringing China out of its international isolation. His pragmatic approach helped make possible mutually beneficial relations with the outside world. It allowed China to benefit from the world's markets, experience, technology and capital. Deng was one of the original members of the Chinese leadership which founded the People's Republic of China in 1949. Before that, he was one of earliest leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and played a major role in the military campaigns which brought the Communists to power after years of civil war. He displayed a remarka;)lc instinct for survival in a political system which tested that quality to the utmost. Along with his family and many of his colleagues, Deng suffered for his views during the Cultural Revolution. He combined political skill with vision and common sense. He understood that China could not prosper without a strong culture of free enterprise and without giving the individual a stake in the eCOnO'!l' iii . '11' the try. Deng did not seck to build a pehCH 'lity cult around himself, as had many comm'.m,st leaders before him. His economic pragmatism was reflected in his famous statement that it u\'-s not matter whether a cat is black or white as long a- it catches mice. The sa n1 c prdgmatism was evident in his international dealings and in his active support for strengthening relationships with the United Slates, Japan and other Western and Asian countries. This same pragmatism wa- reflected in his comr:itment to 'one co:Jntry two systems', which provided a basis for a peaceful return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty, the continuation of which will be vital to Hong Kong's future success. Deng Xiaoping was instrumental after the death of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution in lifting the political terror that had earlier gripped China. His rise to power saw the freeing of thousands of political prisoners. He encouraged cultural and social liberalisation and reduced the intrusiveness of the state into the private lives of its citizens. It became easier for Chinese to get passports, to travel abroad and to marry foreigners. His reforms have transformed the way ordinary Chinese live. His political philosophy, however, was in its essence alien to our own standards and values. He remained committed to tight political control by the Communist Party. This contrasted with the economic change he successfully led and the place that China was seeking to create for itself in the world. These contradictions came to a tragic crisis at the time of the terrible suppression of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989. As many commentators have said, this is an issue for the next generation of China's leaders. We hope that they can harness the forces for change in a positive way that will consolidate China's stability and prosperity and the benefits of that for the Asia-Pacific region and the wider world. The changes Deng introduced were central to the rapid growth of the economic and political relationship between Australia and China. Despite the obvious differences in our ('(I""nhistories and systems \uslralia and Chile! haY<' common ;nterc ... :. whic;1 h,th of us must build on and nurture for our mutual beilel: and for the beneL of the region. China was Australia's sixth largest trading partller last year. Australia is an important destination for Chinese investment overseas, and Australian companies have many important inv'..:stmcnts in China. Australians with Chinese backgrounds are an important and valued part of our community. The people to people links between Australia and China are very strong. Certainly I shall take the opportunity of my visit to China in March to reinforce the Australian government's commitment to strengthen our political and economic cooperation and our bilateral relationship as a whole. Deng Xiaoping was an historic figure, one of the most influential leaders of the last quarter of the 20th century. He transformed China. He has had a profound impact on the course of events in our region and in the world. It is no exaggeration to say that he has helped shape the time we live in. I invite all members of this House to join me in expressing our condolences on his death.",31
41,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to associate myself with the remarks made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and to extend the condolences of the opposition to the Chinese government, the Chinese people and the family of Deng Xiaoping upon the death of the Chinese paramount leader. Deng Xiaoping's life is very much a history of China in the 20th century. When you contemplate the fact that he was born six years before the collapse of the last dynasty in China and leaves just before the conclusion of this century-a century of the most profound and dramatic political change in China with him in a leading position for about 60 or 70 years of it-it really is an extraordinary life. He studied for five years in France in the 1920s and joined the Socialist Youth League there. He was active in the communist underground in China when he returned in 1927. The first of his three political demises to be followed by resurrections then occurred, and he was disciplined and removed from all positions in the Communist Party in 1933. He began the Long March in 1934. He was appointed political commissar of the Communist 8th Army in 1938. He was elected to the Communist Central Committee in 1945, appointed member of the Revolutionary Military Council in 1949 and appointed Communist Party Secretary General in 1956. Then three years after the launch of the Cultural Revolution purge, he was back as Vice Premier in 1973-purged again in 1976 over alleged counter-revolutionary demonstrations following Zhou Enlai' s funeral. He then reappeared in 1977 and was elected to the Communist Central Committee. By 1978, Deng Xiaoping was effectively China's leader and immediately started a process of economic reform. That is an extraordinary history--one which intersects with ours at several points. As we review the history of this century, several things will start to emerge as we view its developments more objectively. I think one development that Australians probably do not contemplate sufficiently is the impact that that army-of which he was the commissar-and other Chinese forces, both nationalist and communist, played on the survival of this nation. It is a simple fact of statistics that during World War II something like seven or eight times the number of Japanese forces were being held down in China than that number used by the Japanese in their invasion south to Australia. Probably the most significant role that the British played during the Second World War, from our point of view, was their activities in Burma, primarily designed not to defend the British Empire in India but basically to keep routes open to the Chinese forces in China that were resisting the Japanese and tying down very substantial numbers there. So as an active member of the military at that time, he was playing a substantial role indirectly in the defence of this nation. He reviewed his political survival capabilities with a very high level of humour and, obviously, very high pragmatism and forbearance. He said once, 'If there were an Olympic medal for people who repeatedly rise from their political plunges, I would be well qualified for that honour.' Risen though your Prime Minister has from time to time, Alexander, I do not think the stakes have ever been as high for him as they were for Deng Xiaoping. The three great leaders of China in this period were Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping. It remains to be seen which of them was most influential on the direction of Chinese policy in the next century, but you would have to say at this point of time that well ahead of the other two is, in fact, Deng Xiaoping. He has been, as the Prime Minister correctly outlined, responsible for a substantial opening of the Chinese economy, a series of experiments-the conclusion of which has not yet been reached-and the slogan that he developed for the development of his country; that is, two systems, one country. At least that was directed towards Hong Kong, but you might well say that of his attitude towards the Chinese economy. We have been, too, the beneficiary of this. Before Deng Xiaoping became the paramount leader in China, the two-way ChineseAustralian trade was some $300 million per annum. That is now $8 billion. That reflects the opportunity that arose from many countries, not just Australia, at the point of time when China decided it would be outward looking economically. The consequences are profound, of course, not only for the Australian economy but for the international economy. Most economists as they view the Pacific region assume that, provided the openness of the Chinese economy continues, access to it, and the development of it, will the principal economic issue, the principal driving point, of the international economy during the next century. Some people introduce reforms for one purpose and may produce others. The purpose for the reforms that Deng Xiaoping announced were for the benefit of the Chinese people, for the growth of the Chinese economy, for the spread of wealth to all the Chinese people. Whether that remains the only consequences of those reforms, we shall see. Those tragic events at Tiananmen Square were correctly referred to by the Prime Minister, but whether that is the last word on the issue of democracy in China is another matter altogether. I think many of us in this place would argue that once you have opened your economy-particularly where economies these days prosper by the extent to which they can usefully exploit access to information technology and the economic opportunities that arise out of that-whether you can sustain the level of political central control in those circumstances is very highly problematic. If that proves to be the case in China over the course of the next century then, having ushered in one economic revolution for China, Deng Xiaoping may well become the person who in practical terms-no matter what the outcome of those tragic events back in 1989-may well have ushered in an entirely different political system as well. Whether or not that happens is no longer in Deng Xiaoping's hands. It is in the hands of his successors. I think it is probably true to say that we will not see again in China people with the level of dominance that those three individuals, including Deng Xiaoping, enjoyed. That level of dominance may not be enjoyed by anybody else in the Chinese leadership. Deng Xiaoping's strength, in part, was drawn from that history that I referred to-his ability to straddle all sides in Chinese politics, particularly that which is associated with the Chinese military. It is virtually impossible for any other person to assume that position himself. Suffice it to say that the President, whom the Prime Minister will be meeting shortly, be has indicated an intention to maintain vigorously the reforms that were instituted by Deng Xiaoping. He has also indicated that the approach that was to be adopted towards Hong Kong will be persevered by the government, without Deng Xiaoping's overriding presence. That is to be very much hoped by all on this side of the House. In conclusion, and to reiterate, we see the passing of one of the truly great figures of the 20th century in Deng Xiaoping. When such a figure passes, neither the world nor his country can be completely unchanged as a result. Our hope for that country, for the relationship between our two countries and for the position of China's role in the international economy is that the world will be very much the better for his presence upon it.",33
42,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"Deng Xiaoping leaves behind him a remarkable memorial with a program of economic reform and opening up that he launched 18 years ago. In fact, it is food for thought that it was after his 75th birthday that he entered the most extraordinary phase of his life. Under his guidance, China has enjoyed unparalleled prosperity and has played a constructive and positive role by and large in the world and the region, especially since 1979. The guiding role played by Deng Xiaoping, which is behind China's constructive engagement in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the APEC forum, and other organisations has also been helpful to Australia's interests and to the region generally. Deng Xiaoping's contribution to China's emergence as potentially one of the world's largest markets and a leading economic power will ensure that he is remembered as one of the key figures of the late 20th century. The government has made clear on many occasions the high priority it attaches to building relations with China. Prime Minister Howard met with President Jiang Zemin back in November in the APEC setting and is travelling to China in a few weeks time. I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in highlighting the fact that Australia's exports to China grew by a very strong 25 per cent in 1996 and imports grew by some 6.7 per cent to a trade now exceeding $8 billion. Australia is China's tenth largest trading partner and a major destination for China's foreign investment. Australia's investment in China has expanded rapidly and, at the end of 1996, contracted investment stood at over $5 billion. As we look to the next millennium, to the next century, to the next phase in the development of China and as we celebrate the 25th anniversary year of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Australia and China, we need to weigh very carefully the role that China is going to play in the modem world and especially the economic role it will take forward. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in offering condolences to the government and people of China on the death of their paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping. Debate (on motion by Mr Reith) adjoumed. NA",34
43,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of an Armenian Pontifical delegation led by His Holiness Karekin I. On behalf of the House and the Australian people, Your Holiness, I extend a very warm welcome to you. May you enjoy your stay with us. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Bougainville",35
44,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Given Papua New Guinea's significant budget deficit after receiving more than $300 million of Australian aid each year, how can the Australian people be assured that no Australian aid is directly or indirectly underpinning the employment of foreign mercenaries in the PNG government's plans to kill the BRA leadership?",35
45,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith for his question because it is clearly an important one. Indeed, this whole issue of Bougainville is one that has been a matter of great preoccupation for this government ever since it came to office 11 Y2 months ago. In relation to the issue of the funding of this proposed operation on Bougainville to be conducted, apparently by mercenaries, we are not, as a government, yet able to ascertain the source of the funds to be used for this operation, nor can I say that we are clear at this stage as to what the reaction of the Papua New Guinea government is going to be to the various representations we have been making to them on this issue during the course of the last week. As far as the funds are concerned, I can tell the honourable member that the government is still investigating this matter. We will continue to investigate it. I really do not want, at this stage, to foreshadow publicly any other action that we might take on this matter. Apprenticeship and Training Opportunities",35
46,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. I refer to the government's commitment to increased apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities for young people and to making it easier for businesses to offer these training opportunities. What action is the government taking to ensure that small business and young people can readily access apprenticeship opportunities?",35
47,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Forde for her question. I know her great commitment to the young people of her electorate and to quality training for those young people. The government is taking steps to address Labor's legacy of unemployment. In the election campaign last year, we said that we wanted to expand quality training opportunities for young people through apprenticeships and traineeships. We wanted to give young people the sort of opportunities they were not getting through the short-term training programs offered to them by the Labor Party and by the member for Hotham in particular. Of course, you ran down the apprenticeship system. In 1995 the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships were the lowest proportion of the work force that they had been for three decades. I am very pleased today to inform the House that I have announced a network of 18 one-stop apprenticeship shops to open across Australia next month, in March, and this will be another key step in the establishment of a new national apprenticeship system to give quality training opportunities to young Australians. There wilJ be four such shops in New South Wales, four in Victoria, three in Queensland, two in Western Australia, two in South Australia, two in Tasmania and one in the Australian Capital Territory. The Commonwealth government is providing $5.2 milJion towards the establishment of these one-stop apprenticeship shops and the state and territory governments are providing $3.1 million. This is an historic cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states to eliminate bureaucracy and get rid of the red tape which the previous government left in place which is strangling small business and, in particular, the apprenticeship system. These one-stop shops will greatly simplify access to apprenticeships and traineeships for businesses and young people. The shops will reduce the approval time for new apprenticeships in new industries from up to a year, which they took under the previous government, to as little as one week in some cases. That is a massive cutting through of the red tape which the previous government did nothing to change over its 13 years in government. It will now be much easier for young people to start apprenticeships and traineeships, particularly in regional Australia. Members of the House will be interested to know that most of these new one-stop apprenticeship shops will be in regional Australia. That shows the commitment of the coalition to the regions neglected by the Labor Party. Another important feature of these pilot one-stop shops will be that many of them wilJ be managed by industry. Email will operate the one-stop shop in Orange. Multiplex wilJ be running the shop at Homebush Bay. Indeed, this will be an important way of encouraging young people into training to help build the Olympic facilities. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry for Western Australia will be managing the Perth projects because, unlike the previous government, we realise that the interest in quality training is particularly in the small business sector and the large businesses. We believe that business enterprises in this country can offer these services in an efficient way that cannot be offered by bureaucracy alone. The network of one-stop shops will be assessed after six months. I anticipate that, as a result of the government's employment reforms and the contracting out of employment services later in the year, by December there will be something like 60 of these onestop shops around Australia. Today's announcement stands in stark contrast to the performance of the previous government and the commitment of this government to offer young people in this country real job opportunities. Austudy",35
48,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Nothing like the reannouncement of Nettforce-a bit of plagiarism around the education system. My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister fully aware of the impact of his government's botched Austudy changes on students and universities? Is he aware that Professor Fay Gale, Chairman of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, said recently that these changes had produced 'the worse start to a university year' in all her time as an academic? Is he also aware that the Executive Director of the A VCC, Stuart Hamilton, has said that the government's backdown may have come too late for the students who have already rejected a place? Having given the minister a bottle of Dom Perignon for her massive breaches of Liberal election undertakings, will the Prime Minister now put a bit of vinegar into her to ensure that those whose opportunities have been crushed by the government's earlier Austudy decisions will have them restored by increasing the availability of places now filled by others?",36
49,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The actual means test-I might say that a form of means test was employed in other areas by the former government-is a fair method of ensuring that Austudy is provided only to genuinely needy families. I want to make it very clear to the Australian people that the principle behind the use of the actual means test is to ensure that people who, by reason of their assets and their income, do not deserve Austudy will continue to be denied it. I do not think it is right or fair that people whose income ought in the eyes of average Australians to disentitle them to Austudy should through some other method be able to claim Austudy. The government stands very strongly behind the principle that Austudy should be rationed to those people in the community who genuinely need it. The actual means test was once described by Senator Faulkner as: ... a fair, equitable and cost effective method of ensuring that Austudy assistance is provided only to genuinely needy families. That was Senator Faulkner on 19 October 1995. As indicated by Senator Vanstone, there were problems with the administration of it. There was understaffing of the hotline, there was inappropriate use of the high expenditure imputation and there was a lack of clarity in the forms. The minister has given attention to those matters and she continues to enjoy my very strong support and that of the government. Bougainville  Minister. Further to the previous answer of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the Bougain ville question, what attitude has the government adopted to the possible use by the Papua New Guinea government of mercenaries to resolve the situation in Bougainville?",37
50,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated in the answer he gave to the Leader of the Opposition, the government was deeply concerned about reports that the PNG government may be considering the use of mercenaries against the rebels in Bougainville. In that context, I arranged this morning for the Leader of the Opposition to receive a briefing from the Director of the Office of National Assessment and I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has also personally discussed the matter with his counterpart, the member for Kingsford-Smith. I did, as recorded, speak to Sir Julius Chan last week. I told him on behalf of the government-and I believe on behalf of all of the people of Australia-that we would regard the use of any mercenaries in the Bougainville dispute as being a very regrettable step and one that ought certainly to be avoided by the PNG government. I took steps to ensure, as did the foreign minister, that the government of Sir Julius Chan was in no doubt of the attitude of the Australian government. We would regard the use of mercenaries as an extremely unwelcome development in the South Pacific. We will follow very closely the response of the Port Moresby government to our representations. We are particularly concerned about the risk for Australian citizens on Bougainville both from this recent development and from renewed hostilities by the BRA. We have already taken steps to warn Australian citizens on Bougainville of the increased dangers they may face. These are very difficult problems. They are not new. As those opposite will know, this dispute has been continuing on and off since 1989. Bougainvilleans themselves differ about the desired outcomes. I recognise, as I hope all members in the House will recognise, that this is not an easy task for the PNG government. We have no sympathy for the BRA, which has carried out a great deal of violence and has constantly obstructed talks. We are convinced that military action is not the answer, that only a negotiated settlement offers a long-term solution. That is a view that I have personally put to Sir Julius Chan on a number of occasions, and I understand that it view put to him by my predecessor and also by the current Deputy Leader of the Opposido tion when he was Minister for Foreign Afage fairs. We have in fact offered to facilitate talks and any reasonable assistance to achieve settlement. The PNG government's best prospects of success, in our view, is to work with the vast majority of Bougainvilleans want peace and help them rebuild Australia has made available substantial aid funds to help relieve humanitarian problems on the island and restore services, including the item of $4 million support for an Internathose tional Red Cross program announced only last week. Mr Speaker, I want to make it clear that this continues to be a matter that the governchanges ment keeps under very close notice. It is not an easy issue for the PNG government, but it black hole. must be made clear to the PNG government, and I hope and I have reason to believe that I may speak on behalf of all members of this House in saying to the PNG government that the only path to a long-term solution is negotiated one. Any use of mercenaries would be absolutely and completely unacceptable and would do great damage to PNG not only in the eyes of Australians but in the eyes people PNG need as their friends for years into the future. Austudy  directed to the Prime Minister. I draw the Prime Minister's attention to the widespread perception that his education minister's certainly Austudy backdown is 'too little too late' remind him that a number of the most obnoxious changes, such as the raising of the age of independence for the Austudy the abolition of the incidentals allowance for the homeless students, still stand. Given widespread and justified public concern the impact of these changes, particularly when combined with the HECS increases and the cuts to university funding, will he ensure a thorough review of the effect of these decisions is begun as a matter of urgency? would he prefer to bury his head where the future of Australian students and of was a our education system is concerned?",37
51,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say at the outset that I not, for example, regard the lifting of the of independence from 22 to 25 as obnoxious. I think that was an entirely reasonable decision. I think many people who see their a taxes go in supporting students at university would regard that as an eminently reasonable decision. I do not regard the decision of the who former government to reduce it as being in their lives. any way reasonable. In relation to the increases in HECS and the other changes that were made by the government, I believe that with the passage of time changes, those increases, will be seen, in the context of the overall requirement of the government to rein in the budget deficit, as having been reasonable. Many of those would not have been necessary if your leader had not left us with a $10 billion Health Insurance",38
52,Mr ROSS CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister a aware of recent claims by the Premier of New South Wales that the decline in the proportion of the population which is privately insured necessitates a wide-ranging inquiry into the of health system? Is this decline a recent phenomenon? What action, if any, did Mr Carr and his Labor colleagues take between 1983 and 1996 to reverse the trend? What action is this government taking? Mr MCClelland- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The first part of the question, the comment on the Carr government, is most out of order. It does not relate to any and of the Prime Minister's responsibilities.",38
53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question is means test and totally in order.,38
54,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you stay around long the enough you hear it all-that is, you hear a about Labor Premier of New South Wales saying that private health insurance is a good idea. I say to the Labor Premier of New South that Wales: where were you four years ago when Graham Richardson said that the system was Or bleeding to death? Where were you when in the sand Graham Richardson said: At a bare minimum we must try to stop the decline in private insurance. I repeat: at a bare minimum we must try to stop the decline in private insurance. If the coverageand it was then 39.4 per centgets any worse we will have huge problems with the queues in public hospitals. That was Graham Richardson on 25 July 1993 quoted in the Melbourne Age. For his pains he was rolled by the former Prime Minister and the now Leader of the Opposition because they opposed doing anything decent to stop the haemorrhaging out of the private health insurance system. As a result, we inherited a system that was in chronic decline. In 1983, when the Labor Party came to power, 63 per cent or almost two-thirds of all Australians were privately insured. By March 1996, under 13 years of Labor, this had fallen to 34 per cent. It has taken the election of a coalition government to bring a commitment to try and stabilise that decline. I have two messages for Mr Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, on behalf of the federal government. The first message is that, if you think you can blame your own negligent management of health in New South Wales on the present federal government, you have another think coming. That is the first message. The second message I say not only on behalf of the federal government but on behalf of many people who have been alarmed at the growing demands on the public hospital system and the decline of the support of private insurance in this country. Where were you, Mr Carr, in the councils of the Labor Party from 1988 to 1989 to 1990 through until 1996 when people were pleading with the former Labor government to do something to stop the haemorrhaging out of health insurance? Where were you, Mr Carr? You were meekly toeing the line. You were tugging the forelock to your mate, the former Prime Minister. You did not have the guts to stand up and attack the former Labor government on this issue. It is the height of hypocrisy and it is an electoral repentance of enormous proportions for the Labor Premier of New South Wales to now tum around and say, 'I have suddenly discovered that private health insurance is a good idea.' The reality is: private health insurance has been a good idea for decades. Under Labor, the opportunity for people to take out private health insurance has been steadily taken away. It has taken the election of a coalition government to bring about a change and to commit the government of this country to the introduction of some decent incentives and some decent recompense for those Australians who are prepared to invest in private health insurance. National Health and Medical Research Council: Chairman",38
55,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You forgot to mention your cuts to public hospitals, too. My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. What communication did you, your office or your department have with Professor Funder about your proposed appointment of him as the chair of the National Health and Medical Research Council? Is the minister aware of a report which claimed: Dr Wooldridge denied earlier through the Prime Minister's office that he had approved the job to Professor Funder subject to cabinet approval. He later retracted the claim, blaming his department for sending a draft contract to Professor Funder. Is this correct? If so, who caused the Prime Minister's office to issue the misleading statement on the minister's behalf? Finally, did the minister comply with section 21(2)(a) of the National Health and Medical Research Council Act and consult with the state health ministers about Professors Funder and Larkins before cabinet considered the appointment? If so, when did these consultations take place and with whom?",39
56,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The government has made a decision on the National Health and Medical Research Council and we have appointed an outstanding candidate in Richard Larkins. As to that process, I have nothing more to say. As to section 21 (2)(a) of the act, it requires me to do two things: first, be confident that the person is an appropriate person, and noone is suggesting that Richard Larkins is anything but an eminent person; and, secondly, to consult my state colleagues. The instrument of appointment was signed this morning, and I consulted with all my state colleagues before the instrument was signed.",39

59,Mr BRADFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the results of the December quarter 1996 company profit survey? What implication does this survey have about the state of the Australian economy?,40
60,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Australian Bureau of Statistics company profit figures for December 1996 showed a strong increase in company profits. In seasonally adjusted terms, profits before income tax rose by 17.3 per cent, increasing by 8.4 per cent through the year to the December quarter of 1996. Profits before tax, interest and depreciation also grew strongly, rising by 8.6 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms for the December quarter and almost 10 per cent in through-the-year terms to the highest level on record. The Australian Bureau of Statistics also noted-this is something I pointed out at the time of the release-that there were a number of businesses which took account of abnormal items in relation to court settlements, intercompany transactions and foreign exchange gains in the December 1996 quarter. They were particularly significant in relation to mining profits. I think both sides of the House will welcome the increase in company profits and the surge that we saw in company profits in the December quarter of 1996. They should be taken together with the import data released the day before, which showed that for the month of January there was a 29 per cent increase in capital goods imports, to the highest level on record. What we see is an emerging picture of recovering profits. We see good capital investment. We see a business investment forecast which has been revised up to 17 per cent. We are seeing a 1Y2 percentage point cut in official interest rates and another 11;2 per cent cut in the standard variable mortgage rate as a result of competitive factors-rates now back to levels we have not seen since the 1960s. We are also seeing Australia locking in a low inflation rate, taking us back to the low inflation club of the world, from which we were expelled in the 1970s, and very strong opportunities for investment. It is investment that leads the way in relation to growth and in relation to jobs. At the same time, the government has put in place over two years $8 billion of fiscal consolidation to try and rebuild those savings which were smashed to pieces by five years of $70 billion cumulative deficits. To put together that savings program, to put together that fiscal consolidation, to win the benefits of low inflation, to get the benefits of low interest rates, to see the returns in relation to investments and to see now a strong flow through into company profits indicates that there are very strong possibilities ahead in relation to the Australian economy, opportunities that business can take, that employees will welcome and that will contribute to a strengthening of growth throughout the course of 1997. Treaties",40
61,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I address my question to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will be aware that world heritage listing cannot be rescinded by the Australian parliament but only by a majority vote of the United Nations. We have had lawyers for Aboriginal interests saying that the Racial Discrimination Act could not be amended or revoked by this parliament because it would contravene some international act that has been signed. Does the Prime Minister agree that signing international treaties does affect our national sovereignty? Does the affecting of Australia's national sovereignty bother the Prime Minister? What does he propose to do about it?,40
62,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My understanding of the legal position is that, until the Teoh case, view was that the mere signing of a treaty did not of itself impose a domestic obligation. But, as a result of the Teoh case, I think the law then became, because of the judgment of the High Court, that it could in certain circumstances impose an obligation without some kind of confirmatory domestic instrument unless there was some declaration to other effect. It was also my understanding that some steps in that direction-I am not quite sure how extensive-were taken by the former government. We have considered the matter and it is the view of this government that the mere signing of a treaty should not, in any circumstances, impose a domestic obligation on this country. I have the strongest possible view-and I think it is a view shared by all of my colleagues and, I hope, by many on the other side; it is certainly shared by at least one on the other side, that is, the person who has asked the question-that the only way in which the law of this country can be changed, or ought to be changed, is through the parliament of this country passing a law. I hold that view very strongly and it is a view that ought to be reiterated in the context of debate about the respective roles of the parliament and the courts in the governance of Australia. I have noticed-if I may digress a moment, Mr Speaker, and I know that you will pull me up if I do digress too much-that there has been some debate in recent days about the role of the High Court and the role of the parliament in our system of government. Can I take the opportunity of saying that I believe that the present system of selecting High Court judges is entirely appropriate. It is a court which is established under the Australian constitution. The processes put in place by the Fraser government in 1976-1 think they were initiated by the then Attorney-General, Bob Ellicott-involved consultation with the states before High Court judges were appointed. I think that is a very good procedure. It is a procedure that, in the event of there being any vacancies while we are in office, will be honoured not only in the letter but also in the spirit. The role of the High Court is to interpret the law, the role of the parliament is to the make the law, and the laws governing Australians ought to be determined by the Australian parliament and by nobody else. Small Business",41
63,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen reports which demonstrate that some sections of the business community are confident about the future while some others, particularly in small business, are still feeling the effects of years of neglect by Labor? What action is the government taking to ease the burdens on small business, to rebuild confidence and to encourage this job creating sector to grow again?",41
64,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware, as the honourable member alluded to in his question, that attitudes of the business community regarding the pace of recovery do vary. There are many strong signs, including the very welcome increase in company profitability to which the Treasurer recently referred, the strong investment figures, the low rate of inflation and the significant falls in interest rates. All of those together have created a far more welcome and a more benign climate for the business community of Australia. It is nonetheless the case that many small businesses have yet to see the benefits of many of those changes and improvements flowing through. In particular, it is worth reminding those in the small business community who remain anxious about the future and concerned that the pace of change perhaps has not been as great as they would have liked and are perhaps understandably prone to be a little critical about the pace of change that many of the benefits have only just begun to flow through. For example, the beneficial effects of the changes in industrial relations only began to come into effect on 1 January. Indeed, the move to Australian workplace agreements will only become the law of Australia on 1 March. Mr Beddall interjecting",41
65,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Rankin!,41
66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Brereton unfair dismissal laws were only confined to the dustbin of Australian political history on 1 January. Although there hav- been some early signs of a signific-nt f.all m the number. of unfair dismissal claIms, It nonetheless remams the case that it will take some months for the benefits of those IR reforms to flow through. The same applies in relation to reductions in interest rates. The benefits of those commonly lag by something like 12 to 18 months. So we can see through the whole of this year the beneficial effects beginning to flow through. I would also remind the member, and remind the House, of the quite revolutionary change to capital gains tax law, which will be of enormous benefit to small business. That is the change that will allow any small business operator to sell a small business and invest proceeds of up to $5 million, not in a business of a like kind but in any other business, and win a deferral of capital gains tax. That very beneficial reform will not come into operation until 1 July. So, gathering all of those things together, may I acknowledge the point made in the honourable member's question. The reaction of the business community is varied. Conditions overall are certainly getting better. They are getting stronger. I think everybody in the House will have probably witnessed over the last two weeks the greatest concentration of good economic news, through hard data and hard statistics, that we have seen in something like 12 or 18 months. You have the investment figures and you have strong employment growth, you had a very optimistic quarterly report from the Reserve Bank of Australia, you had further falls in interest rates--of particular benefit home buyers-and you had a number of other indices that were indicating a strengthening on the employment front. All of those things beckon well for the future of business. I think that, as the year goes by, the small business community of Australia will have every reason to feel more and more confident about its future. When the government delivers its response to the Bell committee report in a few weeks, they will be even happier. Mr Crean-It was to be this week, John.",41
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hotham. Civil Aviation Safety Authority,42
68,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. If the justification for your extraordinary assaults on the CAS A board is your obsession with improving aviation safety, how do you explain the fact that, while deeply preoccupied with these attacks, for three months you sat on a letter raising safety concerns about Falcon Airlines and took no action? Minister, aren't you the real problem in aviation safety?",42
69,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member for Melbourne is genuine in his endeavours to seek out the true cause of the problem in aviation safety, he only has to tum to himself and his colleagues and their 13 years of government, in which time we saw a major deterioration in the standard of aviation safety regulation in Australia. The issue that the honourable member for Melbourne refers to is one that I have already discussed publicly on national television and radio. It refers to a letter which I received from Mrs Ingles during our first few weeks in office. There was criticism by Mr Wheelahan of the time it took for my letter to be passed on to CAS A and be properly dealt with. That matter has been well and truly aired in the public eye. The problem that Mr Wheelahan identified has been resolved. It is worth noting that it was in the first few weeks of our term in office. It is also worth noting that in the same paragraph, where he draws attention to the delay it took for my office to transport that letter from my office to the department, he to makes valid the very criticisms that I have made about CASA and its board in that they did not have a proper process for determining conflict of interest issues. Indeed, not only did they not have a proper process but there was evidence that Mr Kilin, to whom this reference had been made, had been able to circumvent those standards that were already in place. When it comes to the basis of the question, you only need to look to those on the other side of the House to determine the cause of the problems of aviation safety in this country. National Rivercare Initiative",42
70,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Like many river systems, the Hawkesbury-Nepean is experiencing problems of severe degradation. In what ways will the Natural Heritage trust and, in particular, the rivercare initiative and the increased spending on the landcare program, assist threatened river systems such as the Hawkesbury Nepean? Could the minister outline the assessment process which will apply to community submissions for funding under the Natural Heritage Trust?",43
71,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question. I have got quite a bit of good news for him. Opposition members-Oh!,43
72,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have good news for regional Australia-that place that you forgot and then they forgot you. Last week, in conjunction with Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment, I launched the community group applications for funding assistance from the Natural Heritage Trust fund.",43
73,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Pretty.,43
74,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, they are prettyvery attractive. They are all beautifully set out. I have here the guidelines and the means for applying for grants. Advertisements were placed in the national press over the weekend, on Sunday, and will be found in the rural press, including in the electorate of the member who asked the question, during the coming week. Community applications are being sought from the five following key programs: the national landcare program, the national vegetation initiative, the Murray-Darling gram, the national rivercare initiative and the national wetlands program. It is great news for community groups who for so long have sought adequate funding for the very desirable and necessary things that they want to undertake for environmental protection and for agricultural sustainable production but which were never recognised by the previous administration. In relation to the national rivercare initiative, specifically referred to by the member, the Natural Heritage Trust will provide much needed funds in several areas: firstly, to reduce nutrient inputs into the riverways and waterways, such as effluent discharges, fertilisers and salt inputs; to provide for the revegetation of recharge and discharge areas; to provide protection from stream bank erosion; to reduce sedimentation of creeks and rivers; and to protect instream ecology and so on. Given the pressures that have been placed on the Hawkesbury-Nepean system, I have no doubt that the rivercare and landcare programs will bring a lot of benefits to those rivers and to the surrounding countryside. The honourable member's question went to another issue-that is, assessment. I want to say first up that it will not be by means of a white board. It will be done properly. It will be a rigorous process of integrity. In the first case there will be regional assessment panels which will assess the initial applications made. Secondly, there will be state assessment panels. Prior to recommendations being delivered, recommendations will be looked at by the Commonwealth and those assessments will be made simply on merit. Applications will be open until early April. It will be a rigorous process. Announcements will be forthcoming in July or August. It is obviously hard for people opposite to believe that there could be a process of integrity. With your track record, that is not surprising. But this is one. It is transparent and it is up-front. I urge all members to get out and support these programs. Plainly, they will do a lot for the sustainable use of our resources. Mr O'Connor interjecting",43
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Corio 2001 pro- had better watch his words.,43
76,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They will deliver real jobs in rural and regional Australia: firstly, by securing the jobs that are there; secondly, through the implementation of the programs themselves; and, thirdly, by the enhancement of the sustainable use of resource bases in the future. Precision Aerial Delivery System",43
77,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development and it relates to matters of processes of integrity. Minister, is it a fact that in August 1995 the RAAF pronounced the precision aerial delivery system, known as PADS, unsafe to use or even test? Is it a fact that, in spite of this, at your instigation Airservices Australia resolved in August 1996 to buy 104 PADS units, subject to a fly-off test to determine its effectiveness? Is it a fact that this decision was taken without any tendering process? Is it a fact that in subsequent training and testing, PADS has again been found unsafe to use, been banned by CAS A and approximately $1.5 million of taxpayers' money has been wasted?",43
78,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The matter that the honourable member for Melbourne refers to,44
79,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are Waldo Pepper, you are.",44
80,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I see the member for Kingsford-Smith joining in in this exercise. It is fascinating. You know the opposition is not really serious about what they are doing when they roll out the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith on matters of probity. That is the equivalent,44
81,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. The point of order goes to relevance. The minister was asked a very specific series of questions. He is ranging way off that in the answer that he has given to this point. I would ask you to bring him back to those very specific questions, which related to a very important area of safety and a very important area of government waste and a very doubtful role on his part.",44
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable minister is ranging widely, and I am sure he is about to focus on the specifics of the question.",44
83,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I could not resist the temptation of the interjection from the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. This matter goes to a meeting that I had at the request of Mr Gruzman last year in which he had sought to demonstrate to me the virtues of his precision aerial dropping system, which is described as PADS. He demonstrated to me in the ministerial entrance foyer last year the way the equipment could work. I referred Mr Gruzman's request to Airservices Australia to see whether they felt it was appropriate to test the equipment in a proper situation. I discovered, following that, that Airservices Australia did choose to test the equipment that Mr Gruzman had available. They also tested it against their existing equipment, which had been the subject of considerable controversy over the years. Those who have followed this issue with any interest would realise that there has been some controversy over the quality of the Airservices' equipment that is being used for search and rescue. A trial was run and it was found that the equipment provided by Mr Gruzman, PADS, hit the target eight times out of nine, whereas the Airservices' equipment hit the target only three times out of nine. So, from Airservices' own trialling of this equipment, it became apparent to Airservices, so I discovered, that the PADS equipment was far more useful, far more accurate and far more likely to save the lives of those people who have been lost at sea. Interestingly enough, there is a bit of history attached to this that goes beyond the issue that the honourable member for Melbourne raised, which was in the 1995 RAAF report that he referred to. It goes back to 1990 when the former Minister for Transport, Senator Bob Collins-and I was briefed on this issue by Airservices Australia last yearinstructed, according to their words, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to buy the very same PADS equipment and to have that equipment purchased and installed as part of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority'S own equipment for search and rescue. That was done under instructions from the minister without a tendering process and without even a trial of the product. I find it somewhat strange that those in the opposition today can find that the process that Senator Bob Collins, the then Minister for Transport, engaged in, which did not involve a product trial, which did not involve a tendering process and which involved an instruction to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, is somehow right and that the process that I engaged in, which was to refer this matter to Airservices Australia for testing, is somehow wrong. I think there is a double standard here which highlights the silly little political game that these people are engaged in. Rabbit Calicivirus",44
84,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and Technology. Is the minister aware of reports suggesting that the rabbit calicivirus can transfer to other animals? Is there any scientific evidence to refute these reports?,45
85,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. He well knows and appreciates the economic and environmental need to reduce Australia's horrendous rabbit population. I have seen the reports by a couple of overseas scientists that the rabbit calicivirus disease infects other animals. I can assure the House and the wider community that there is no scientific evidence here or overseas for such claims. Australia has run the most extensive testing in the world on calicivirus on at least 33 representative animal species-domesticated and wild, native and feral. They were all given large doses of the virus and there was no sign of infection.",45
86,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,45
87,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And there are a few candidates for testing on that side of the House. But I assure the House at the same time that the calicivirus does not infect humans.,45
88,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,45
89,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Although there are a few animals on that side who could be candidates as well. Do not let me be distracted. Calicivirus will not jump species, no matter what form or type of animal it might be, and does not affect humans. I also add that worldwide 43 different species have been tested and the virus did not grow in any of them. Some of these claims that it may infect humans are totally wrong. The Department of Health and Family Services oversaw a major study in which blood from 259 people exposed to calicivirus infected rabbits was tested. There was no evidence of infection at all. Our scientists have been in contact with 47 leading laboratories overseas on this issue. They all confirm that human infection with rabbit calicivirus is not known to occur, and no ill effects have been seen even in people working very closely with the virus. This virus has been present in more than 40 countries around the world, including Europe, mostly since the 1980s. There have been no scientific or medical reports of human infection from any of those countries. I hasten to add that these tests were undertaken pursuant to well-established protocols. All introductions and releases of biological control agentswhether by CSIRO or anyone else-have to satisfy the requirements of the Quarantine Act and the Wildlife Protection Act, and obtain permits and authorisations. These are given only after consideration of a proposal by 21 different agencies-federal and statecovering agricultural and conservation interests. So I can conclude only that those who make these wild claims have not investigated the issue of rabbit calicivirus disease as thoroughly as Australia has. Precision Aerial Delivery System",45
90,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We now know why John Sharp is still transport minister.,45
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Move to your question.,45
92,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Precisely what involvement did youGovernment members-Look at him.,45
93,Mr T ANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am happy to look at him. Precisely what involvement did you and your office have in the Airservices decision to acquire PADS, the negotiations over the price and other details of the contract, and the letting of the PADS training contract for $4,000 per week with no tendering process?",45
94,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To add further to the question that I was asked a few moments ago, the Minister for Defence has indicated to me that RAAF officers were at the trials of the equipment at Merimbula and that the RAAF observers believe the PADS units have potential but that their P3C aircraft is not a suitable platform from which to drop the units. I thought it would be useful to add to that answer. In regard to the question put by the honourable member for Melbourne, I restate what I said earlier in the House today: that is, Mr Gruzman sought a meeting with me to explain his equipment. Having explained and demonstrated it to me, I then referred it to Airservices Australia for testing and trialling. As far as that is concerned, that is the only involvement we have had in it. There was at one stage some correspondence between Airservices Australia and my office in regard to the issue, and that was following the matter of Mr Gruzman having done the trials and having proven that his equipment was substantially better than the existing Airservices equipment. A very important point, and one worth noting from the House's point of view, is that the PADS equipment, when trialled against the existing equipment, hit the target eight times out of nine. Airservices' equipment hit the target eight times out of nine. If you are interested in trying to save the lives of people lost at sea, that is a worthy goal to achieve to get this type of equipment in place. I can table a letter between me and Mr Anton Gruzman. Mr Gruzman was constantly trying to get me involved with the commercial negotiations between Airservices and himself and his father. I wrote a letter to Mr Gruzman last year, which I will table, which tells Mr Gruzman that he must direct all of his inquiries to Airservices Australia. Once Mr Gruzman brought the issue of this PADS equipment to me and demonstrated it to me here in Parliament House, the whole matter was referred to Airservices Australia. I took no other role in it. The matter was driven by Airservices Australia. They ran the trials; they made the judgments. The letter that I table today makes the point that I referred all of it to Airservices Australia. Business Migration",45
95,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Minister, many people in my electorate recognise that the coalition government has placed a greater emphasis on skilled migration to Australia. Can you inform the House what investments business migrants have made recently in Australia and what impact business migrants have had on job creation?",46
96,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. The government has been working to restore the balance in the migration program to ensure that we obtain an economic benefit as well as a social benefit from the immigration outcome. One of the areas in which we have been able to provide additional places has been the business skills program, which brings in entrepreneurs, those with business acumen and those who are prepared to invest in Australia and its future. We have seen quite considerable growth in that area. I know that the honourable member's own electorate has benefited considerably by people who have come through that aspect of the program. One of those who won a significant migrant award for business investment in Australia came from the honourable member's electorate. In the first half of this financial year, business migrants invested $187 million in state government securities, which is one of the requirements under that leg of the program. The funds are obviously working for Australia. The state governments use those funds for part of the government securities in infrastructure and public works. In addition, migrants across the business migration categories are expected to bring in $850 million in 1996-97. On average, each family transfers something of the order of $795,000 within two years of arrival, and half of that is invested in their business activities. We monitor this part of the program very closely, as we want to ensure that people make those investments. What we have established is an excellent record in performance. Within two years of arrival, 75 per cent are in business-mostly small business. They are creating jobs because, on average, they employ 5.6 people. Sixty-three per cent are involved in exports, and 25 per cent have an annual turnover of one million or more. This is a very important reason why we ought to be ensuring that there is growth in this part of the program and to be redressing the balance that we have seen in recent years get very much out of line. Legal Aid: Marini Case",46
97,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Attorney, is it true that the Commonwealth has known since September last year that the Marini case was coming up for retrial? Is it also true that the Commonwealth has known since last year that Marini, who has been charged with serious Commonwealth offences, would be ineligible for a grant of legal aid from the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission under guidelines agreed by your representative on the commission? Attorney, why was Mr Marini given a federal legal aid application form only this morning? Attorney, why have you failed to put in place procedures to ensure that major criminal trials can proceed and so protect the community?",47
98,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me just make a couple of preliminary points. The first is that we are talking about a criminal trial. Unfortunately, in the legal aid debate a number of individual cases are being raised. It needs to be borne in mind that those individual cases involve serious charges of which people have not been proven guilty. The second point is that ordinarily people who seek legal aid are entitled to confidentiality in respect of their applications. Let us come to the Marini case. The Commonwealth has provided full funding to the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission in this year, 1996-97. There has been no reduction, subject to indexing. Subject to indexing, there has been no adjustment.",47
99,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Commonwealth representative agreed to those guidelines.,47
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Denison has asked his question.,47
101,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The funding is available for Commonwealth matters to be dealt with by the Legal Aid Commission. What has happened over a number of years under the Labor government is that Commonwealth money has been shifted over to state legal matters and the state government has not picked up the responsibility. We are seeking to rectify that. The Marini case is one that is affected by the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission taking steps to try to rectify the situation from 1 July. If the Marini case came up for trial after 1 July, the Commonwealth would have full responsibility. As it is, the Commonwealth has provided full funding this year to the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission. But, in accordance with the lack priorities given to it by the previous Labor government, it has just applied it to matters for which the state government is responsible. As far as the Marini case is concerned, if the state government of New South Wales does not fund it, as it ought, then, given that the Commonwealth money has been used on matters for which the state is responsible, if the state government does not fund it, we will entertain an application from Mr Marini. As yet, we have not received one. Defence Force Personnel: Employment of Spouses",47
102,Mr BOB BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Given the wideranging importance and influence that spouse employment issues have over the Australian Defence Force retention rates, can the minister inform the House as to the measures this government is taking to improve the employment prospects of Australian Defence Force spouses?",47
103,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The question of employment for spouses of serving ADF personnel is particularly important from two aspects: firstly, it is important to the individuals themselves; and, secondly, it does have an effect on both recruitment and retention rates. It has also been established that the unemployment rate for spouses of ADF personnel is higher than that of the national average. Accordingly, we have put into place several initiatives-and I have, in the last little while, initiated five particular initiatives. The first is the provision of local employment information seminars and the inclusion of employment related material in information packs distributed to spouses. The second is the installation of 30 Internet sites; these will be up and running by October 1997. This will allow spouses to access CES and other employment databases. There will also be on-line a job guide which will enable users to acquire information about careers and training options. Job clubs will be formed where there is an express need for same. Also, an employment handbook, which will be launched in October 1997, will be made available. We are also investigating the possibility of reimbursing the costs incurred by spouses who require to reregister or transfer their professional qualifications to another state or territory. There are just one or two points about the Internet facility. I think it is important to know that there will be 30 stand-alone sites. We will ensure that each will be simple and user friendly. They will be loaded and functional, once having been plugged into the phone socket. It was said by some that the technology of the Internet might perhaps be too difficult to use. I think it is important to know that attention has been paid to make it user friendly, that there will be a buIletin business board and, in addition, these sites will be located in the defence community organisation or neighbourhood houses to enable there to be ready access to them and to have people in place to assist spouses with the usage of this new facility. We believe also that in Darwin a particular trial will take where a volunteer group, who have already established a business network, will be able to use particular local information to enhance the task of finding jobs for spouses of serving ADF personnel. Legal Aid",47
104,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Can the minister confirm that his department has provided advice that the cost of establishing a separate Commonwealth legal aid scheme would exceed the savings estimated to accrue from the budget decision to cut funding by $120 million? What would the cost be?,48
105,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There have been a number of discussions between officers of the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Finance in respect of this particular issue over several months. The Department of Finance, as I am sure all honourable members would be aware, gives as much assistance and support on any issue of costing as is possible. I can say that, as regards the specific exercise that the honourable member refers to, I shall get details as to what that comes down to and inform him later. Marriage and Relationship Education",48
106,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. Late last year you announced funding for 34 new marriage and relationship education services to be established throughout Australia. What other steps has the government taken since then to assist couples in their marriages and relationships?,48
107,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Herbert for his question. I am personally well aware of the close interest he has in the subject of marriage and relationship education. Last Wednesday, at his express invitation, I visited his electorate. I visited, in the course of that visit, one of the principal marriage and relationship education service providers in the Townsville area, namely, Centacare Townsville. I will mention them in a minute. The coalition has a very strong commitment place to families, which was evidenced in the coalition commitment of additional funding to marriage and relationship education. It is regrettable that the cost to families of marriage breakdown is great, both financially and emotionally. Coalition policy is to put more resources towards preservation of relationships rather than to rescue them in their situation of breakdown. As the member for Herbert indicated, in January I announced the commitment of funds to 34 new marriage and relationship service providers to deal with areas which are of high priority. They were identified as of high need in an analysis conducted using Grants Commission and ministry of finance techniques. Those successful applicants are in the process of setting up their services. We look forward to a launch of them before the end of April. Can I mention that that raises the number of funded outlets to 89. It will, in addition, assist thousands of couples across Australia. One service, I think, needs particular mention. This is a pilot program in the Northern Territory, to be conducted by Anglicare, for the provision of marriage and relationship assistance and education to indigenous people. We look forward to that developing into a larger program. We are currently conducting an evaluation of the existing services with the view, later in the year, to expanding the funding to further new services which will be identified, again, on a high needs basis. They will particularly focus on rural and remote areas. I mentioned visiting Townsville. Centacare Townsville is one of six providers receiving minimal funding. They have been given additional modest funding to enable their services to be upgraded. With the family tax initiative and commitment of funding to services like the marriage and education family services program, the coalition is fulfilling its strong commitment to families.",48
108,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Hansard Record",49
109,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. You might recall that, in an answer to the member for Melbourne on Thursday, 13 February, the Hansard tape records the Prime Minister as saying, in part: And if the Labor Party imagines, if you really imagine, that you are sort of getting through to the mob, to the Australian community, on this issue The Hansard proof copy on page 655 quotes him as saying: Does the Labor Party really imagine that they are getting through to the Australian community on this issue? Mr Speaker, you will note that the reference to 'the mob' has been omitted. Has the Hansard been changed by the Prime Minister's office? But, if not, will you allow the Prime Minister to correct the record before the bound volumes of Hansard are produced so it will more correctly reflect what he said?",49
110,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"My attention was drawn to that. I specifically inquired of my staff as to whether any change had been made by them. They told me it had not. I did not make any change, and I have been informed by my staff that the change is in fact made by Hansard. Hansard confirmed to me today that the change was not made by my office or by me. I might say to the Leader of the Opposition and to all members of the House that for years it has never been my practice to edit in any way the comments I make in this House. Any attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to suggest that I altered this is completely wrong.",49
111,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I ask a supplementary question. Having made no accusations, there is nothing to withdraw. Will you, therefore, in conformity with the second part of my question, ensure that the Prime Minister's office has leave to correct the Hansard so that, when it appears in the bound copies, it accurately reflects what he in fact said?",49
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Order! The query raised by the Leader of the Opposition falls into the province of my responsibilities. Generally members will be aware that, whilst the Hansard is an accurate representation of what has been said in this chamber, it is not a verbatim account of what has been said in this chamber. As we would all recognise, there are occasions when the editorial contribution from Hansard is most welcome. In this instance, I will take it up separately, examine the reason why this editorial input has been effected and listen to the tape as well. I will advise the Leader of the Opposition separately of the outcome.",49
113,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"My predecessor used to change the Hansard, not me. Hansard Record",49
114,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question for you, Mr Speaker, further to the issue that has been raised. Could you also make inquiries and advise the House as to whether the Prime Minister or his staff advised you or Hansard of a correction needing to be made before the Prime Minister rose in the House?",49
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I think the Prime Minister's response to the questions has been completed. I am totally unaware of any moveMr Lee-On a point of order, I think the House is entitled to know whether the Prime Minister made any effort to inform the House before the issue was raised by the Leader of the Opposition. NA",50
116,Mr ROCHER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I wish to make a personal explanation.,50
117,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,50
118,Mr ROCHER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Indeed, three times in the one article. Scurrilous!",50
119,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Proceed.,50
120,Mr ROCHER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In the 21 February edition of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, an article attributed to the Minister for Small Business  written I suspect by a bush lawyer on his staff",50
121,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member will move quickly to where he has been misrepresented.,50
122,Mr ROCHER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"He misrepresented me in the first instance in a minor way by spelling my first name incorrectly. That bit of sloppy research aside, he went on to accuse me of petty vindictiveness, apparently arising out of his difficulty in answering a question or two asked of him without notice. Mr Speaker, I wish to assure you and the House that the minister has done so little of anything of consequence that I do not have any strong feelings about him at all.",50
123,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Move quickly to the matter you need to address.,50
124,Mr ROCHER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The ghost writer referred to sad bitterness on my part, which is a trait I am sure you will agree I do not enjoy. Sad-certainly not. Grumpy-sometimes. That also seems to be the product of the precious ego of his staff and is, of course, incorrect.",50
125,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,In the same article I claim to have been misrepresented and I wish to make a personal explanation.,50
126,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member for Moore claim to have been misrepresented?,50
127,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,50
128,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Move quickly to your point.,50
129,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I will. In addition to those assertions that the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has already referred to, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer  Mr Filing's claim that small business would be better served by placing the portfolio in Cabinet merely underlines his poor understanding of the Government's commitment to small business. He also stated: In the case of Messrs Rocher and Filing, their ignorance is also tinged with a sad bitterness. This misrepresents my interest in representing my constituents by questioning the conduct of the minister of his ministry. There is no petty vindictiveness in this or ignorance tinged with a sad bitterness, rather I am conscious that for so long as he is the minister for small business he can expect questions reflecting my concern to ensure that he fulfils his promises.",50
130,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I think the member for Moore has made his point. Resume your seat. NA,50
131,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Repatriation Benefits To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that there is only one exclusion from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable overseas 'active service' by Australians. That being under 'Operational Service' at Section 6.(l)(c)(ii) of the Act for members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960. The various claims used to date to maintain their exclusion have now been proved wrong by documents in the Australian Archives and elsewhere in the public domain. Some of the claims used to support the exclusion are: (a) members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted (which applied to all service personnel everywhere); (b) they were in no danger (they shared the same dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and were also required to serve under the United Nations command in Korean waters in case that war had started again); (c) they were never 'allotted' for operational service (a letter from the Secretary to the Department of the Navy dated 11 November 1955 categorically stated the date from which the RAN was 'allotted' for operational service was 1 July 1955); (d) they were not on 'Special Overseas Service' (such Service began with the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act of 1962 i.e. two years after their service ended and did not therefore apply to them); and (e) they were not on 'active service' (their service complied with all but one of the requirements of the only Defence Department definition of 'active service' the exception being 'or in military occupation of a foreign country' which did not apply to Malaya). Your petitioners therefore request the House to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby giving the Australian sailors involved comparative recognition and treatment with all other Australians who have honourably served their country on active service overseas. by Mr Anthony (from 25 citizens), Mr Downer (from 15 citizens), Ms Gambaro (from seven citizens), Mr Jull (from 60 citizens) and Mr Marek (from 38 citizens). Repatriation Benefits To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable 'active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded. There are two forms of benefits for ex-servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for 'Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex-members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex-members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam. It is claimed that: (a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on 'active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications; (b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial; (c) the Royal Australian Navy was 'allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently 'unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced; (d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA 0130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld 062 of 1990) the courts found the two ex-members of the RAN had been 'allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex-members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found. (e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the 'Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended; (f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for 'active service'. The fourth, for 'military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya. Your petitioners therefore request the House to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable 'active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960. by Mrs Bailey (from 10 citizens), Mr Reith (from five citizens), Mr Rocher (from 10 citizens) and Mr Taylor (from 20 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain residents of the Statefferritory of South Australia draws to the attention of the House their concerns regarding cuts and changes to child care spending by the Federal Coalition Government in its August 1996 Budget. In particular these include: the withdrawal of the operational subsidy for community based child care centres; the imposition of a 50 hour limit on child care assistance; the abolition of 5,500 new child care places and the introduction of an option for families to have child care assistance paid directly to them rather than to the service. These cuts will adversely affect families and children by eroding equitable access to quality child care and protection. Reducing this access will also mean that many good quality, community-based services will become unviable. Your petitioners request that the House: Reinstate the Operation Subsidy for all community-based services Remove the 50 hour limit on Child Care Assistance Reinstate the 5,500 community-based child care places Ensure that Child Care Assistance payment are made directly to services Reinstate the $30.00 Disregard for Family Income Assessment for Child Care Assistance. by Ms Macklin (from 456 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain residents of the Statefferritory of Victoria draws to the attention of the House their concerns regarding cuts and changes to child care spending by the Federal Coalition Government in its August 1996 Budget. In particular these include: the withdrawal of the operational subsidy for community based child care centres; the imposition of a 50 hour limit on child care assistance; the abolition of 5,500 new child care places and the introduction of an option for families to have child care assistance paid directly to them rather than to the service. These cuts will adversely affect families and children by eroding equitable access to quality child care and protection. Reducing this access will also mean that many good quality, community-based services will become unviable. Your petitioners request that the House: Child Care Reinstate the Operation Subsidy for all community-based services Remove the 50 hour limit on Child Care Assistance Reinstate the 5,500 community-based child care places Ensure that Child Care Assistance payment are made directly to services Reinstate the $30.00 Disregard for Family Income Assessment for Child Care Assistance. by Ms Macklin (from 69 citizens). Copyright To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We the citizens and business proprietors of the Northern Rivers draw to the attention of the House our objection, under the Commonwealth Copyright Act 1968, in being required to hold a Copyright Music Licence pertaining to the playing of background music by way of radio, cassette or CD at our business premises. Your petitioners therefore request the House to amend the relevant legislation in respect to the above. by Mr Anthony (from 53 citizens). Copyright Petition to the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: This petition of certain residents of the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House, a strong opposition by petitioners to the licence fees charged to small businesses by the Child Care Australasian performing Rights Association to play music, whether by radio, television, cassette or compact disc, within their business. Your petitioners therefore request the House to note that those petitioners whose signatures appear below: 1. Believe this is double dipping by APRA, by making money on the sale of music and charging licence fees to radio stations, and then charging small businesses the licence fees for playing the same music; 2. Believe the Copyright Act should be changed to protect small business from this exorbitant, unfair and unnecessary fee. by Mr Eoin Cameron (from 59 citizens). Taxation Laws To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in the parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of Lilley draws to the attention of the House of Representatives that the repeal of Section 120(l)(c) of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1996 will increase pressure on the Golden Circle Fruit and Vegetable Cannery at Northgate Queensland to re-locate off-shore and will expose the industry to multinational predatory tactics. Your petitioners therefore request the House to reconsider the decision. by Mr Beazley (from 4,148 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. This petition of certain residents in the State of Queensland expresses concern at the Federal Government's recent decision to cut funding to the ABC by $65 million over two years. This decision will severely compromise the role of the ABC as an independent, non-commercial source of news, sport, information and entertainment. The ABC is a widely respected Australian institution, recognised as a service committed to quality and excellence in broadcasting. The funding cuts which have been announced are the largest ever to the ABC since it was formed in 1932. This decision contrasts completely with a commitment given by Prime Minister, John Howard, and Communications and the Arts Minister, Senator Richard Alston, prior to the election in March 1996. It was then promised that ""The Coalition will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC."" We request the House to calion the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia to stand by their pre-election commitment, and rescind its recent decision to slash funding to the ABC. by Mr Bevis (from 60 citizens). Consumer Price Index To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, Canberra: We the undersigned petitioners do show that: 1. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), of necessity, covers all prices including luxuries and; 2. Pensioners spend their income on the necessities of life, which rise by greater amounts and more frequently than other items, and the pension, adjusted twice yearly according to the CPI, is losing its value and has become inadequate to our needs. We therefore call on Parliament to grant an immediate $10 (Ten Dollar) increase in the weekly pension over and above the CPI, and this we humbly pray. by Mr Bradford (from 1,360 citizens). Commonwealth Employment Service Offices To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of MCPherson draws to the attention of the House that the facilities of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security situated in the suburb of Palm Beach, City of Gold Coast, Queensland, are quite unsuitable for that suburb. The existence of the facilities and congestion caused by patrons are causing problems, inconvenience, nuisance and distress to residents and are materially detracting from the amenity of the area. Your petitioners respectfuilly urge the House to persuade the relevant Commonwealth Departments to relocate the said facilities to a more suitable location elsewhere than in the suburb of Palm Beach. by Mr Bradford (from 51 citizens). Abortion Funding To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House the procedures of D&X (partial birth-skull decompression) abortions. We further point out to the House that such procedures cause death by dislocation of the vertebrae or by removal by suction of the brain. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House opposes any appropriation to Medicare to fund D&X abortions, and calls on the National Health and Medical Research Council to oppose D&X abortions. by Mr Eoin Cameron (from 20 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of State of Western Australia, draws the attention of the House to our opposition to the budgetary cuts to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. We, the undersigned, believe that the announced $65 million cut to the funding of the ABC and the Government Inquiry into our national public broadcaster will irreparably damage the basic services that we, as rural Australian citizens, rely upon. As international experiences have shown, the introduction of advertising can compromise the impartiality and independence of a public broadcaster and lead to a decline in its charter. Therefore, we request the House not to decrease the funding to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and do not introduce advertising. by Mr Eoin Cameron (from six citizens). Violence: Media To the Honourable the Speaker and members of House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We the undersigned citizens of Australia, view with alarm the high incidence of violence in our community. Of particular concern is the number of random crimes, some extraordinarily brutal, which are eroding public peace of mind and leaving many people feeling personally threatened. We believe that the violence saturating our visual media-television, videos, newspapers/magazines, films and advertisements-both encourages and legitimises violent behaviour. The portrayal of violence, in context, which carries a rational message, can be acceptable, however its use as a marketing ploy simply to catch consumer attention and boost ratings or sell products is totally irresponsible. We acknowledge social and economic factors play a significant part in motivating violence, nevertheless the sensational portrayal of violence in the media is one important i'actor that we, as a community, have the power to change, and we therefore call upon the Parliament to: Take legislative action to prevent gratuitous brutality and suffering being promoted as ""entertainment"" and/or used as a marketing ploy. Tighten restrictions on the importation of violent videos and films. Conduct an immediate inquiry into the sensational coverage which some elements of the media, in reporting news, give to violent events. Expand public awareness campaigns aimed at discouraging violence. by Mr Eoin Cameron (from four citizens). Child Support To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for reforms in the Child Support Scheme. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to introduce and implement the following reforms: 1. That child support payments be calculated on the non-custodial parent's (payer) net basic rate of pay, exclusive of all allowances, overtime and loading. Not on gross income as it is at present and the lowering of percentages. 2. Lowering of ""the cut off points"" as an incentive to continue in the workplace. 3. Child Support payments be calculated from the net income on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis. 4. The non-custodial parent receives a reduction in the child support payment while he or she has the children for periods of time e.g. holidays. by Mr Eoin Cameron (from three citizens). Child Support To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House, the legislation regarding the formula used by the Child Support Agency to calculate the amount of Child Support payable by the non-custodial parent for a child/children from a previous marriage/relationship. Your petitioners therefore respectfully urge the House to review this formula under the guidelines of the options below: Option 1: (a) Establish a set amount to be paid, per child, allowing the non-custodial parent to respond with details of their income and expenses before assessment is finalised, with reviews available under 'hardship'; (b) decrease the amount payable by the noncustodial parent if the custodial parent is employed, subject to different percentages, depending on whether in full or part-time employment; or Option 2: (a) If the custodial parent remarries, the non-custodial parent should only pay the same amount as paid, per child, by the Department of Social Security to a parent receiving a benefit, eg., sole parent; (b) the household income of the custodial parent be considered and amount of child support be reduced if the household income exceeds a stipulated threshold; or Option 3: (a) Allow a provision for step-children being supported by the non-custodial parent with special circumstances, eg., the step-child receives no support from the non-custodial biological parent; (b) increase the self-support income for the noncustodial parent to allow a reasonable standard of living for the non-custodial parent with a subsequent family where the spouse is dependent or nondependent. by Mr Mutch (from 16 citizens). Marriage Act Petition to the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: We the undersigned citizens of Western Australia, request that the Government and Parliament urgently consider amendments to the Marriage Act to modify the effects of the Section relating to under age marriage by specifically acknowledging a person's right to marriage where that person's beliefs require marriage to take place. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will give this matter earnest consideration and your petitioners in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Eoin Cameron (from three citizens). Sugar Industry To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of Page and Richmond, who are directly associated with the New South Wales sugar industry points out to the House that: The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has recently received the report of the Sugar Industry Review Working Party which contains recommendations regarding changes to regulations relating to the Queensland sugar industry and to the total Australian sugar industry generally. The New South Wales sugar industry is a completely deregulated industry whose production is refined at the Harwood Sugar Refinery and sold predominantly into the domestic market. In recent times, the NSW industry has developed significant export markets for raw sugar which is surplus to domestic market requirements. The Working Party, which contained no representation from the New South Wales industry has recommended, among other things: (i) The removal of sugar tariffs. It recognises that this will have a far greater impact on NSW than on Queensland growers; (ii) Continuation of monopoly control of the bulk sugar export terminals by the Queensland industry, despite the fact that the NSW industry contributed to the cost of construction of the seven terminals in Queensland; and (iii) The Working Party makes no recommendation to change the administration of the USA import quota entitlements which are granted to the Australian nation, but are presently controlled by the Queensland industry for the sole benefit of the Queensland industry; and asks the House to: Recognise that the removal of sugar tariffs will cost NSW producers between $6 and $9 million per year which is proportionately a far greater impact than will be suffered by Queensland producers. Request the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to assume control of the administration of the USA import quota entitlements and grant NSW an unconditional 5% of the quota each year, based on NSW's share of national sugar production. Provide a once-off assistance payment to assist the NSW sugar industry establish its own worldcompetitive raw sugar export facility and so lessen its dependence on the oversupplied domestic refined sugar market, as well as to further deVelop its export of co-generated electricity from its surplus renewable fuel, bagasse fibre. by Mr Causley (from 351 citizens). Circus Animals To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that under the Quarantine (Animals) Regulations of the Quarantine Act 1908, approval is given for the importation of free ranging exotic animals such as lions, tigers, bears, elephants and non-human primates to be used for entertainment purposes in circuses and mobile displays. The issue of circuses using animals is very complex and includes: Transportation of animals, where the animals are kept in tiny cages, often travelling in extremes of temperature over long periods; stressful training techniques, often based on fear, deprivation and brutality and often inhumane living conditions, which do not allow any display of instinctual behaviours. We also believe that inappropriate messages are put forward by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks. It is certainly not consistent with the focus on environmental awareness for people, especially children to leam that it is acceptable to exploit wild animals for human entertainment. We therefore humbly ask that the House prohibit the importation of all animals including those listed under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) for use in both international and Australian circuses. We ask this based upon the inhumane conditions that the animals are kept in, the conditions under which the animals are transported, the often cruel training procedures, and the inappropriate messages conveyed to children by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks. by Mr Causley (from 30 citizens), Australian Securities Commission To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House That on the 5th day of June 1995 the Australian Securities Commission registered a company name Virgin Mary's Pty Ltd and issued a certificate of registration of the said name; or That thereafter the company used the name Virgin Mary's in conjunction with a bar restaurant at the premises situated at 119 Commercial Road, Prahran, in the state of Victoria, and above the said premises has erected a large sign displaying the name Virgin Mary's and other signs bearing the said name elsewhere on the premises That many concerned citizens have complained to the Australian Securities Commission and to the city council of Stonnington of such use of the said name is both offensive and blasphemous And that the company has otherwise conducted the business using blasphemous and offensive terms for the purpose of advertising its business operations Your petitioners therefore request that the House enquire and direct the Australian Securities Commission that it shall: (1) revoke the registration of the name Virgin's Mary's Pty Ltd as a company name; (2) refrain hereafter from registering or permitting to be registered any sacred names as company names; and (3) hereafter take all appropriate steps within its powers to prevent the use of sacred names for business or commercial purposes. Your peti t i oners therefore request that the House enquire and direct the Australian Securities Commission by Mr Costello (from 3,488 .:itizens). Australian Securities Commission To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: Your petitioners therefore request that the House enquire and direct the Australian Securities Commission that it shall: (i) revoke the registration of the name Virgin's Mary's Pty Ltd as a company name situated at 119 Commercial Rd Prahran, Victoria; (ii) refrain hereafter from registering or permitting to be registered any sacred names as company names; and (iii) hereafter take all appropriate steps within its powers to prevent the use of sacred names for business or commercial purposes. by Mr Costello (from 39 citizens). Cambodia To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: We, the undersigned, urge that the House: (1) Closely monitor preparation for the upcoming Cambodian election in 1998 and to secure the agreement of the Cambodian Government to full and unhindered participation of international observers for the 1998 election; (2) Support the continuation of human rights monitoring in Cambodia by the United Nations. (3) Encourage Cambodia's other Donors and trading partners to raise human rights concerns with Cambodia; (4) Raise human rights concerns at the Donors' Consultative Meeting for Cambodia and during consideration of the projects in Cambodia to be financed by international financial institutions; (5) Provide assistance to Cambodia to broaden democratic civil society, to strengthen the rule of law and to ensure that future elections in Cambodia are free and fair. by Mr Crean (from 27 citizens). Aged Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the harmful and unfair policies of the Federal Government concerning elderly Australians. In particular, the decision to abolish the Commonwealth Dental Health Program; the decision to charge up to $26,000 to enter a nursing home; the decision to increase charges for recipients of Home and Community Care; the decision to increase prescriptions for pensioners by SOc to $3.20, and the failure of the Federal Government to list the following medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Those medicines are: cetophil lotion, eurax cream, prantal powder, daktarin, anusol, senagar mixture, betamin, b-plexforte and vitamin C. Your petitioners therefore ask that the House calls on the Federal Government to reconsider these policies in the light of the detrimental effect they will have on older Australians. by Mrs Crosio (from 94 citizens). Unemployment To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to: the continuing high levels of unemployment in Sydney's south-west and the decrease in Federal Government funding to successful labour market programs in the area, including the SkillShare program and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, leading to the closure of employment centres and a reduction in the number of people in the area able to utilise these programs. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House recognises the deleterious effect that such a reduction in funding could have on employment levels in the south-west Sydney region, and restores Federal Government funding of labour market programs to 1995/96 levels. by Mrs Crosio (from 53 citizens). Health Insurance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, residents of the State of South Australia draws to the attention of the House to: The creation of an American Health Care System in Australia through the empowerment of health insurance companies through legislation inown as the Health legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Act 1994 to conscript doctors and to dictate terms and conditions of treatment of patients with private health insurance and to exclude categories of illness from health insurance products and to divulge to the Commonwealth Government the personal details of illnesses for which hospitalisation is required. hy Mr Downer (from 90 citizens). Holsworth), \ irport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Campbelltown and Liverpool draw the attention of the House to the fact that our suburbs and quality of life will be severely depleted by the construction of Holsworthy International Airport. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to immediately abandon any plan to construct an airport at Holsworthy. by Mr Latham (from 173 citizens). Multiculturalism To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of NSW calls on the Federal Parliament to initiate and promote an education program aimed at: 1. Informing citizens of the benefits obtained by Australia and its people from our immigration program, and 2. promoting the richness of the cultural diversity and tolerance that exists in Australia which has gained the respect of the international community and has benefited Australia through trade links and greatly influenced the selection of Sydney to host the year 2000 Olympic Games. by Mr MCClelland (from 1,427 citizens). Bone Marrow Donor Institute To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for the Government to assist with funding the bone marrow donor institute cord blood bank. Hospitals currently dispose of blood from the umbilical cord, after a birth, which could give new hope to children with Leukaemia. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House consider financial assistance to augment the efforts of community fundraising to establish cord blood banks in every capital city. by Mr Reith (from 885 citizens). Legal Aid To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament assembled: The petition of the citizens of Australia brings to the attention of the House the Federal Government's plan to make major cuts to Legal Aid funds. The Federal Government plans to cut $40 million annually from Legal Aid funding. Last year, 250,000 people were assisted nationally. However, if these cuts go ahead, many Australians will be denied access to 1 wide range ,f services, and only the well-of! will be able to access the justice system. The undersigned petitioners therefore ask the House of Representatives to call on the Federal Government to protect every Australian's right to equal access to the justice system by continuing to fund Legal Aid at its pre··election level. by Mr Williams (from 146 citizens). Petitions received. NA Middle East Peace Process  That this House: (I) declares support for world efforts to secure peace in the Middle East; (2) notes the stalling of the Middle East peace process following the recent elections in Israel and encourages all parties to return to meaningful peace negotiations; (3) supports the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 420 and 525 seeking the withdrawal of all foreign troops and returning full sovereignty to Lebanon; and (4) notes that sustained peace in the Middle East must include the return of full sovereignty, democracy and human rights in Lebanon. It is true to say that the Middle East has been a powder keg for some time, but we have recently witnessed moves to establish peace there. A great irony is that two of the leading protagonists, President Yasser Arafat and the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, established their reputations as peacemakers. In 1994, both were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, quite justly, for their efforts. But the smooth progress of peace in the Middle East was severely interrupted with the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and, of course, the House passed a resolution of condolence on his assassination. Shimon Peres, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, took over as Prime Minister for an interim period, but I think it is true to say that he did not enjoy the same stature in the negotiations as his predecessor and the situation was a little bit more unstable after the assassination. We then had the Israeli elections and, although they were very close and hard fought, Shimon Peres lost the election. We now have Prime Minister Netanyahu. He was originally elected on an anti-peace programcertainly not one of giving land for peace. That is the background to this motion which I moved and which, I am pleased to say, will be seconded by my good friend and colleague the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson). Since that motion was placed on the Notice Paper, I am pleased to report to the House that, once again, the pace of Middle East peace negotiations has picked up. We have seen, with the election of President Arafat, democracy installed in the Palestinian authority. We have also seen the difficult issue of Hebron negotiated between the parties and the occupying Israeli forces withdrawn. There is no doubt that there are even more difficult hurdles to negotiate between the two leaders. I think this House can only wish them both well and trust that there will be further successful negotiations and a greater embedding of peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis. However, this motion also deals with Lebanon. It is sad to report to the House that, notwithstanding the Taif accord signed in Saudi Arabia at Tarif in September 1989, Lebanon is still an occupied country. I suppose there are three groups of forces there. Firstly, the Israelis occupy southern Lebanon. Secondly, we have the Syrians there with a sizeable army of something like 30,000. Thirdly, the Hezbollah, which are backed by Iran and Syria, are also in Lebanon. The Taif accord was the peace plan that got a ceasefire between the warring parties, the Christians and the Muslims, and restored some semblance of order and government back to Lebanon, where they had suffered some 30 years of warfare. Whilst we refer to the government of Lebanon, it is true that it is hostage to the Syrians. The purpose of the motion is to suggest that all foreign forces should withdraw from Lebanon. You will not be able to successfully negotiate a peace plan between Jordan-as has already been done-Palestine, Syria and Egypt and leave Lebanon as it is. In fact, Lebanon more than anything else seems to be the forgotten country in the peace process. I hope that situation will change. I would like to give the history of Lebanon. It is a country with a long and, more recently, sad history. Its history is interwoven with our own, because we have not only 100,000 people born in Australia but a further 400,000 people who can trace their ancestry to Lebanon. Once the homeland of the ancient Phoenician traders, Lebanon became part of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. After World War I, the Greater Lebanese state was created and administered by France under a League of Nations mandate from 1920 until its independence was declared on 26 November 1941. A republic was established in 1943, and full autonomy granted in 1944. Lebanon is characterised by religious and cultural diversity. At the time of independence, the Christian communities had a slight majority, the largest of these being the Maronite Christiansnearly 30 per cent of the total. I know in the electorate of the member for Reid-and certainly in my own-there is a significant Maronite Christian population. The relative size of the communities ed the basis of the unwritten 'national pact' of 1943, which tried to strike a balance of power between the Christian and Muslim groups, by giving equal representation along religious rather than ideological grounds. The two groups were able to live together in relative peace and harmony for the next 30 years. This balance was thrown out by the later influx of Palestinian refugees created from the new state of Israel-and subsequent Arab-Israeli wars-and the unrest in the Muslim groups who believed that the government no longer reflected the true 'balance' of the population. By the 1970s, it was generally accepted that the Christians no longer formed the majority, but the government was seen to favour them. At the same time-1968 onwards-Palestinian freedom fighters based in southern Lebanon not only clashed with the Israeli forces but with the Lebanese Christians groups-despite Lebanese Muslim sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Unable to control the violence between the Phalangists and the Palestinian groups, the Lebanese government of President Sulaiman Franjiyia resigned in April 1975. The conflict soon escalated into a full scale civil war between the Lebanese National Movement and conservative Christian groups. The main cause of the violence changed focus from the treatment of the Palestinians to changing the constitutional order of the Lebanese stateseen to favour the Christian minority. After at least 50 failed cease-fire agreements, a more durable cease-fire was secured at the Arab summit meetings in October 1976. This was a result of Syrian intervention in the conflict in mid-1976 in order to prevent an outright Lebanese National Movement victory. After this cease-fire, a 30,000 strong Arab Deterrent Force, mainly Syrian, entered Lebanon and halted hostilities for a short time. Despite this, the civil war has left the militias in control of most of the country. In September 1976, the Maronite militias united, becoming the Lebanese Forces, and gradually took control of East Beirut and much of northern Lebanon.

132,Mr ANDREWS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"No conflict since the end of the Second World War has been so constant, so continuously in the minds of people of the Western world, so ready to erupt onto the front pages of our papers or onto our evening television bulletins than the conflict in the Middle East. Neither the tragedy that is Northern Ireland nor the troubles closer to home in East Timor or in Bougainville have attracted the world attention of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. For decades we, in this country, have watched from afar as the conflict is played out in a series of wars, peace accords, transgressions and political rhetoric. At times there seemed great hope for peace; at times, considerable despair that the aspirations of different peoples would be reduced to armed struggle. All of this is background to the events of the past few years in which the coexistence of the Israeli and Arab people has been at the forefront of regional and global attention. In October 1991, leaders of the Arab and Israeli peoples gathered in Madrid, the first of a series of meetings over the years that have edged forward the peace process. In September 1993, Israeli and Palestinian leaders declared a number of principles in Oslo which established the basis for the resolution of ongoing disputes between both groups. The Oslo agreement was then followed by an agreement in Cairo in 1994. These agreements resulted in the redeployment of the Israeli defence forces from all major Palestinian cities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with the exception of Hebron, and the election of a Palestinian Council with Yasser Arafat as chairman. Following the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin and the subsequent election of Benjamin Netanyahu to the prime ministership of Israel, many commentators doubted that the new leader would implement the Oslo agreement. Given Mr Netanyahu' s public comments doubting the agreement on occasions, there was some justification for these misgivings. But, in the end, the election promises were honoured and the Hebron agreement signed. That such an agreement was entered into by Benjamin Netanyahu illustrates a changing assessment of the Israeli-Palestinian question. It was the first time that a Likud government has negotiated and signed an agreement with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. As the Israeli commmentator Ze'ev Chafets wrote recently in the New York Times: To say yes to Hebron, Mr Netanyahu had to jettison 50 years of revisionist orthodoxy about indivisibility of the land of Israel. He had to renounce his own previous writings and speeches, to break ideologically with the father he venerates, to alienate the West Bank settlers who helped elect him and to infuriate many in his Likud Party. He is also risking his life. Such a move deserves to be applauded internationally as a major step towards peace in the region. The Australian government welcomed this development and urged all parties to prevent and avoid provocative actions that may lead to renewed tension. But the agreement should not be mistaken. Behind it is an unshakeable commitment to the security of Israel. Unless that is recognised, hopes of peaceful resolution will be lessened. In this context, Australia has supported the right of Palestinians to self-determination. To this end, there are a number of pledges by the PLO that remain unfulfilled, including the promise to revise its charter to eliminate references to the destruction of Israel and the complete renunciation of violence. The interim agreement on 28 September 1995 states that Israel and the Palestinian Authority shall seek to foster mutual understanding and tolerance and shall accordingly abstain from incitement, including hostile propaganda against each other. Given the subsequent Hebron agreement, we can only hope that such reciprocal actions follow soon. The situation of southern Lebanon is another instance of the need for real reciprocity in action. The conflict, as the honourable member before me pointed out, is now some 20 years old. It commenced with Israeli efforts to drive Palestinian forces from the state's northern border. As we know, Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, withdrawing in 1985 and subsequently creating a 14-kilometre wide security zone between the two nations. As we speak, debate continues in Israel about withdrawal from the zone. The Australian government has supported United Nations Security Council resolution 425 which calls for the explicit withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon and 'calls upon Israel immediately to cease its military action against Lebanese territorial integrity and withdraw forthwith its forces from all Lebathe nese territory'. In my opinion, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the region is less likely in the absence of a commitment from the Hezbollah forces that they will be controlled by the Lebanese army and not respond in tum by attacking northern Israel. Then there is the position of Syria which has shown itself intransigent to date. It is unrealistic, for example, to expect Israel to hand back the strategic Golan Heights in the absence of any guarantee against shellings of the like of those which were undertaken prior to 1967. One matter should be clear from the events of the past months, years and decades: that is, peaceful coexistence in the Middle East will only be possible if all the parties recognise the absolute, unshakeable commitment of the Jewish people to the maintenance of the state of Israel. If this principle is respected, both rhetorically and in practice, then the difficulties of Hebron, of the Golan Heights, of southern Lebanon, of the Gaza Strip, of the West Bank and even Jerusalem itself can be negotiated with a sense of trust and purpose. It will provide a basis upon which the sovereignty of each of the parties can be respected and their rights protected on an equitable basis. But trust is not found in its mere expression. It requires practical commitment. That is why the events of this year, 1997, will be important in determining whether real peace can be achieved in the region.",59
133,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"As one of the earlier speakers noted, my electorate does have a significant Maronite population. But, like probably no other electorate, it has a fairly fine balance between those of Lebanese-Muslim extraction and Maronites. As well, it is the site of the only Palestinian club in Sydney. What we are seeing is a culmination of the reality of the collapse of the Cold War. The United States taxpayer is less inclined now to spend $2 billion to $3 billion a year financing the Israeli state. More particularly, there is a greater questioning in United States politics of the advisability of the extension of housing into occupied parts of Palestine. That is the fundamental reality that the Israeli state does have to face, regardless of whether it is led by a Netanyahu, a Peres or a Rabin. When we talk about balance, it is worth noting that Netanyahu is being courageous in going against some of the indications he gave earlier. I do not think for one moment that we should ignore the difficulties that Arafat faces internally in his organisation as to how far he has had to carry the PLO. They might have had a restriction imposed on them by the reality of the closing off of Arab finance after their support for Iraq against Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Internally, it is a very difficult process for him just as much as it is for Netanyahu. It is worth noting the reality of what has occurred in regard to Israel's acceptance of these peace proposals. The actual cabinet vote was 12 to 7. It took a 12-hour debate, which was adjourned for clarification from the United States, and it was essentially carried in the Knesset because of support from the labour party after a significant abstention by government supporters. That, of course, is a similar pattern to what happened with Begin over the question of Sinai. There are certainly major pressures on Israel. However, CNN polls show support for the peace process in a broad sense of more than 65 per cent, both in the occupied territories and within Israel itself. So there is a broad span of support for it. On the question of Palestine, I for one, whilst a very long-term supporter of the Palestinian cause, would at this stage voice some concerns over the question of human rights within the Palestinian ruled area and the deaths of people in custody. There are real questions regarding the proper training of Palestinian police and their ability to adhere to human rights requirements. A significant number of people have already died in custody. That is one thing that we should bear in mind. In a similar vein, on the other hand the Western world has to appreciate the difficulties that the Palestinian state does face. The World Bank has estimated that $2.4 billion will be required over a five-year period to essentially establish the state. The World Bank, of course, is not a propaganda organisation in the service of the PLO so that is probably a fair estimate of things. I appreciate that the Australian government has given $15 million over a three-year period. We have been in there and we are playing a real role in training and some other areas. The other aspect of the motion is the question of south Lebanon and the nine-mile perimeter: the question of 200,000 Lebanese being separated from the rest of Lebanon and the presence of a variety of foreign forces. I deplore the occupation by Syrian forces and their influence on the government. But we should not run away from the reality that some people in Lebanese politics, who cooperated in massacres like Sabra and Shatilla, at one stage wanted foreign interference because they themselves were on the back foot. We have to be consistent and say that we do want the withdrawal of all foreign forces. We do not want the interference of Israel, Syria, Iran or any others in the internal affairs of the country. I commend the motion. I think it does represent balance and it does indicate the way that negotiations should progress. Finally, we talk about the various failings of the PLO and the things it has not observed. We do have an Israeli side of the debate. (Time expired)",61
134,Mr ZAMMIT,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"AII peace loving people of the world expressed a sigh of relief on 15 January 1997 when an agreement was signed between Israel and the Palestinian authorities on the terms of the redeployment of the Israeli defence force in Hebron, which has gone a long way in diffusing the tension and raised hopes that further violence and loss of life will be avoided in the future. I am pleased to rise to join in this debate in support of world efforts to secure peace in the Middle East and in support of urgings by the international community to encourage all the parties to work vigorously to keep the peace process moving forward. The Australian government remains fundamentally committed to Israel's right to exist with secure and recognised borders as well as the right of Palestinians to self-determination. The Australian government also supports an enduring and comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East based on UN resolutions 242 and 338, concluded between Israel and the PLO in 1993. The Australian government also recognises that the attainment of a lasting peace will require goodwill from all sides in which the sovereignty of each of the parties is respected and their rights protected in a renewed effort. In the few minutes remaining to me I want to speak about the courageous little nation of Lebanon that gets forgotten when one talks of the Middle East peace and justice principles of self-determination and the removal of foreign political interference in the internal affairs of nations and the removal of foreign military forces based on the soil of such nations. The Lebanese nation continues to suffer from the dual hardships I have mentioned. Much of Lebanon today is dominated by non-Lebanese military forces, including 30,000 Syrian troops, a contingent of about 1,000 Israeli army regulars, several armed Palestinian factions and an Israeli supported militia in southern Lebanon. However, by far the greatest hindrance to Lebanon's return to genuine freedom and self-determination is the political and military interference by Syria. In 1991, a security agreement was negotiated between Syria and Lebanon providing a modus vivendi for their armed forces. However, Syrian military intelligence units operating on Lebanese soil have consistently broken that agreement. In 1989, the Arab League, acting as peacemaker, negotiated a peace agreement at Taif in Saudi Arabia to end the civil war in Lebanon. One of the tenets of that agreement was that Syria was to fully withdraw their armed forces from Lebanon. This continued interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon by Syria is repudiated by the overwhelming majority of Lebanese citizens. Before the 15-year war in Lebanon, the Lebanese people lived in harmony-Muslim, Christian and Jews all together. Lebanon was one of the major financial and commercial centres of the Mediterranean. The 1975-1990 war was fuelled by foreign interference in the political and military spheres of Lebanese life which inflicted massive damage on the economic infrastructure and dramatically undermined the commercial leadership that Lebanon traditionally enjoyed. The current day economy is recovering strongly and the government has undertaken an ambitious reconstruction program and is working towards the restoration of confidence. Lebanese people in the past have been invaded and subjugated by the Phoenicians, Egyptians, Hittites, the Assyrians, followed by the neo-Babylonians. That was followed by the Romans for 600 years, the Arabs for 500 years, the Crusaders for 200 years and the Turks for 600 years, yet the Lebanese people have always been able to maintain their integrity, their culture and heritage. The Lebanese people want genuine freedom and that will only occur when foreign military forces withdraw and when Syria, especially, gets the message from the world community to get out of Lebanon. My call, in the best Australianism I can muster today, is to say: a fair go for Lebanon.",62
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Order! The time alloted for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Antarctic Science Programs,63
136,Mr NEHL,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House acknowledges and endorses value of Antarctic science programs being taken by the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions and the International operative Research on Antarctica and the Southern Ocean Environment. I acknowledge the presence in the gallery of the chairman of the CRC, Mr Michael Hudson, who has become so involved in recent years in Antarctic research. It is also worth noting that this motion has received full bipartisan support from both sides of the House and it will be seconded by my friend the member for Lalor, the Hon. Barry Jones. If we are going to talk about Antarctic science in 1997 we have to recognise that is the 50th anniversary of Australia's continuous activity in Antarctica. Sir Douglas Mawson and others were there very early this century. ANARE-the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions-has been operating science programs since 1947 and recognised internationally for its to a vast variety of international science programs. The core scientific programs include atmosdone. pheric sciences. Ozone depletion is now question of global interest and highlights the need for research into the physics and chemisrecently try of the Antarctic atmosphere. It offers unique opportunities for research in physics into the middle and upper atmosphere. already have, and have had for some years, very important cosmic ray research at Mawlogue, son. There are also the biological sciences. Some species of Antarctic plants, animals microbes are amongst the most abundant forms on earth. I name krill just for one, which is so important to the whole life on planet. Looking at the life that does exist on Antarctica itself, there are 300 lichens, 80 mosses, hundreds of non-marine algae, fungi, bacteria, mites and nematodes. The average Australian might say, 'So what? What does this have to do with us?' The reality is that because so many of these creatures have an in-built anti-freeze compound and because so many of these creatures have in-built sunscreens, the potential for humanity from research in Antarctica is absolutely enormous. If you look at the situation of a moss which the goes through eight, nine or 10 months under underseveral metres of ice and then comes by and survives, an enormous benefit can come from Centre for Coresearch there. The geosciences are very important. Glaciology looks at the ice sheet mass balance, the ice sheet paleo-environmental record, sea ice and applied geology. I mention in passing the work that is being done by Professor Patrick Quilty and others at Marine Plain. The work that has been done with very limited resources has been absolutely extraordinary in looking at and getting scientific information on many fossil whales and dolphins. The research is also looking at the impact of possible tourism. this Oceanography is vitally important. Obviously, the four of us who are speaking in this debate today could all go on for very much longer than the time we have, because this subject is very important. There is so is much going on that it is just impossible to contribution take note of it all. While I am still talking about ANARE, I take note of the medical research that is being Even though I have been involved and a interested in Antarctic research for the 12 years I have been in this parliament, it is only that I became aware of the tremendous work that is being done. There is medical research into human interaction with the We Antarctic environment. Very interestingly, Antarctica is an anaif you like, for space research. The polar medical people of ANARE are underand taking dialogues and meetings with NASA, life the American space agency, because the research being done in Antarctica has some this value for the proposed Mars probe. We are going to have a very small population of human beings in total isolation for about 31/2 years. As far back as 22 May 1902, a gentleman called Edward Wilson noted in his diary about Antarctica that he saw parallels between Antarctica and space. He wrote: It was a wonderful night . . . Sounds carried an immense distance. The stillness was almost uncanny. One could imagine oneself in another dead planet. I could easily imagine we were standing not on the Earth but on the Moon's surface. Everything was so still and dead and cold and unearthly. Mr Deputy Speaker, I apologise again for my wretched cold.

The member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) will be spending more time talking about the CRe. Before I leave the subject, I want to talk about some of its research progr«nls because the connection between surface and deep waters of the world is vitally important. The oceans control the movement of heat and that affects climate change. The CRC is doing an enormous amount of work on climate, on the movement of the oceans and on the ice sheet mass balance. We should realise that if all the ice in Antarctica were to melt, the oceans of the world would rise by 60 metres. That does not bear thinking about. It is also interesting that, whereas there is so much talk about global climate change and warming, the reality is that it is expected that the sea level around the world will fall by 10 centimetres or more by the year 2050. It is interesting, too, that with that ice sheet, because water expands when it is warmer, the sea level rises. Warmer weather, more evaporation. More evaporation, more snow on Antarctica and more water on the ice sheet. So you have got this connection. In summer there are about four million square kilometres of sea ice around the landmass. In winter that gets to 19 million or perhaps even 22 million square kilometres of ice. The final point I need to make is that water becomes heavier as it freezes into pack ice. The sait drops out.

138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded?,64
139,Mr BARRY JONES,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Lalor) (4.15 p.m.)Ant.;rctic research is a major refutation of the fallacy that science can only be justified or needs to be paid for only when it has a direct economic impact-that it is aimed at growth, product, employment: 'The market rules, OK?' This view, held deplorably but in a bipartisan way during the past 15 years in Australia, asserted that all values had a dollar equivalent and that the worth of scientific endeavour ought to depend on support from industry. Antarctic research is difficult, dangerous, exciting and costly. As you know, Antarctica is the driest, coldest, windiest but also the highest continent on Earth. But we can never predict the value of research in advance. In 1995 the Nobel Prize for chemistry was awarded for explanations of the ozone hole phenomenon, first detected by British observers at the Halley Base. It was shared by Paul Crutzen, Mario Molina and Sherry Rowlandnot to be confused with Dick Morris's former associate. This is a classic example of vitally important work which was regarded for many years as being of no value. Antarctic research and the implications of possible rises in the level of the oceans due to the greenhouse phenomenon is another example of research, once undervalued, now seen as being of global importance. The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) in his introductory speech referred to that. I will return to it later. I should declare an interest. I had ministerial responsibility for Antarctica from March 1983 to July 1987. My only visit to Antarctica, courtesy of the US Air Force, was in December 1983 when I was able to inspect MCMurdo, South Pole, Bull Pass and the 'dry valleys', the New Zealand Scott Base and Lake Yanda. I confess never to have visited an Australian base, unlike the honourable member for Cowper, and can only claim that in walking around the south poles-both the geographic pole and the photographic pole-I went through every meridian of longitude in the two Australian sectors. My period as minister was at the high point of the massive rebuilding of the Australian bases, a program inherited from my predecessor, David Thomson. There was always complaint at the time that we had to find room for toilet bowls and plumbers in the Antarctic supply vessels, but there was not enough room for scientists and scientific equipment. It is true that Australia has been involved Antarctic research for a very long time. Sir Douglas Mawson was there first in 1909 with Sir Edgeworth David in a British scientific expedition. Mawson then first found the south magnetic pole, which, as you know, migrates around. Mawson initiated systematic scientific exploration of Antarctica in his two great expeditions-1911 to 1914 and then, after a long gap, 1929 to 1931. In the first, the great geologist Sir Edgeworth David made pioneering discoveries, the implications of which we are only now coming to grips with. After a very long gap, Antarctic research began again in December 1947. As we have been reminded, this is the 50th anniversary of ANARE. I know that the good wishes of this crowded House go towards ANARE for that achievement. The first expedition was to Heard Island. Dr Phillip Law AC directed ANARE from 1949 to 1966. He founded the three permanent bases-Mawson, Davis and Casey-and explored no less than 4,500 kilometres of coast. For decades Antarctica was regarded as a potential source of minerals for the world until Bob Hawke took an initiative with France in 1990, also supported very strongly by Italy and Belgium, for scrapping the proposed minerals regime and securing international recognition for maintaining Antarctica as a pristine area. This was incorporated in the Madrid protocol of 1991, which prohibited mineral and oil exploration and preserved Antarctica as a unique laboratory for climatology and oceanography. Heard Island, the MCDonald Islands and Macquarie Island, which is part of Tasmania, have been nominated for world heritage listing. Australian Antarctic Territory itself is not eligible under the 1972 World Heritage Convention because national sovereignty of the Antarctic continent itself is not recognised under the Antarctic Treaty system. The honourable member for Cowper referred to the Antarctic CRC, the Antarctic Cooperative Research Centre. The Cooperative Research Centre for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Environment, to give it its full name, is a joint venture between the in Australian Antarctic Division, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the Australian Geological Survey Organisation, CSIRO and the University of Tasmania. They are making very major contributions to our understanding of the great phenomena down there. Mention has already been made of the work being done on the ice sheet mass balance. There was some speculation that if we were going through the phenomenon of global warming-which we certainly appear to be in Melbourne-then there was likely to be, it was assumed, increased calving of the great ice mass down in Antarctica, which would then lead to a melt down and therefore a catastrophic rise in sea levels. However, this appears simply not to be the case, according to the work being done by the Antarctic CRe. This is a discovery of tremendous significance. Nevertheless, as recent photographs in the newspapers and on television indicate, some extraordinary things are going on in central Antarctica. Great fissures are arising, quite unprecedented in their size and extent. There are still very many mysterious problems that we do not quite understand the reasons for. I will quote from a research report from the Antarctic CRe. It says: It is also still an open question as to whether the overall mass balance of all the other drainage systems of Antarctica is positive or negative, and therefore whether the balance of the complete Antarctic ice sheet is close to equilibrium. Various nations are making similar measurements of the mass balance on most of the other significant drainage systems in Antarctica. This is an area of very great significance. I was looking at the annual report of the Department of the Environment and the costing of the scientific work being done. I came across some odd figures suggesting that the total amount of expenditure on Antarctic research for the last four or five years adds up to approximately the cost of running the constitutional convention in November of this year. Arguably, one might think that the total value of Antarctic research over that period will be considerably more than the constitutional convention. Still, we shall see. Let me just mention one or two more of the extraordinary processes that are going on. The research report says: The Antarctic CRC has developed a new and more accurate technique for continually monitoring the total rate of accumulation of snow over the Antarctic continent. The average snowfall in Antarctica is equivalent to only about 15 centimetres of water per year, confirming that it is by far the driest continent on earth. Over thousands of years the snowfall has built an ice sheet covering the continent with an average thickness of about two kilometres. It is often forgotten just how huge that icecap is. Extraordinary work is being done on bacteria. The Antarctic CRC has discovered a readily cultivatable bacteria which may reduce the considerable cost of enriching the diet of farmed fish. The new bacteria, which come off the sea ice from Antarctica, may be readily grown in existing equipment on fish farms to provide a much cheaper source of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to young fish. Again, this is something that was undreamt of a few years ago but which may well have a quite fundamental impact on the viability of the Australian fishing industry. It is another classic example of how some of the most important contributions to society in the economy come from scientific research.",64
140,Mr MCDOUGALL,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Griffith) (4.26 p.m.)I have much pleasure in supporting the motion moved by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). I do so after visiting our bases in the Antarctic during the Christmas break. I was accompanied by the director of the Australian Antarctic Division, Mr Rex Moncur, who assisted me greatly in investigating our operations at the three bases of Mawson, Casey and Davis. From my observations and discussions with the director and others, the importance of our Antarctic science programs cannot be understated. There is the obvious matter of environmental studies. The vast land mass encompasses diverse ecosystems, ranging, as you have heard, from cold deserts to the sodden sub-Antarctic, from the pack ice to the salty lakes, from areas of ice-free land to the vast ocean regions. This is a unique continent. For that reason alone, it is important that we have a firm presence there. It is the most pristine land mass on earth. It is also the coldest continent and holds the record as being the driest and the windiest on planet earth. It is also the highest, as we heard from the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), with an average elevation of 2,300 metres. Nearly twice the size of Australia, the land mass of the continent is approximately 13 million square kilometres. When you include the winter band of sea ice surrounding the land, you have an area of some 20 million square kilometres. As this ice sheet holds 90 per cent of the world's ice, we are also looking at 70 per cent of the world's fresh water supply. Because of its remoteness, this ice is very pure, but small traces of impurities are detectable by today's sophisticated equipment. As a result, we have an instant environmental record stretching back over 200,000 years. Many nations are interested in the fate and the future of the Antarctic, not only for its strategic and scientific importance but for its great mineral wealth plus its potential as a tourism destination. Australia, as you have heard, Mr Deputy Speaker, is a member of the Antarctic treaty, with some 12 nations originally signing that treaty. Since then another 29 nations have been included. The treaty stipulates, amongst other things, that the Antarctic should forever be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. It also prohibits any measures of a military nature. The treaty also guarantees freedom of scientific research throughout Antarctica and promotes the exchange of information. The scientific aspect has been most successful. Currently, Australian scientists are working with other treaty members on an international research program on global change. This summer while I was there I had the pleasure of meeting up with some Dutch scientists who were working on our Casey base during the summer period. The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research goes by the unfortunate acronym of SCAR. Part of the research carried out by SCAR has provided background information for understanding the evolution of the flora and fauna of the region. Another program being carried out by the International Council of Scientific Unions is to establish the role the southern ocean plays in the generation of oceanographic water masses. Evidently, this is a science poorly understood at this stage. From the Antarctic we are learning about the impact of humans on the environment. There are extensive studies being carried out on marine pollution and the more publicised aspects of the Antarctic studies of global environmental problems-notably, climate change and the depletion of the ozone layer. In Antarctica, the atmosphere, oceans and ice sheet interact in a way that influences climate and weather over a major portion of the globe. Therefore, scientific studies in meteorology, upper atmospheric physics, oceanography and glaciology are subjects of keen international research.",66
141,Mr HOLLIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am pleased to join my colleagues in speaking on this important private member's motion. I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for bringing the motion before the House. It is not surprising because his knowledge and love of Antarctica are well known in this chamber. He has brought Antarctica to the fore not only to his colleagues in this House but also to the wider public. What has always been shown in Antarctica in the operation between many nations is the ability for cooperation. Research has been carried on there for many years. Even during the Cold War, scientists from various nations-Russia and Australia-were always able to cooperate. This shows much and is a credit to science, because often science rises above the political situation. It is good that the scientists have been able to do that. I note that the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) spoke about work on the bases. I am pleased to assure him, as the former chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works, which has the responsibility for the work on these bases, that this important work has now been carried out. It was important that we had a strong presence in Antarctica. I do not necessarily go along with the statement that was once made to me that Australia has aggressively imposed itself on Antarctica. We have an important presence because we claim quite a large part of AntarcticaMr Barry Jones-42 per cent.",67
142,Mr HOLLIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Yes, and this is in dispute. Unless we continue our work there on our bases, our claims to that percentage of Antarctica will not have validity. In many respects the work being carried out is really the unsung part of scientific research in Australia. Research-whether it is on global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer and various other aspects such as climatic change-is important not only to Australia but also to the rest of the world. Every time we bring up Antarctica in this chamber it is always of such a bipartisan nature that one is loath to sully it with a political jab. Mr Quick-No, don't.",68
143,Mr HOLLIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I cannot resist. I hope that the current government, with its fetish for cutting programs, will at least spare the Antarctic Division. I know the honourable member for Cowper, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall) and many other members on both sides who have been there will use their considerable influence on the minister when he goes before the economics committee to ask them to spare any cut in the research program and any cuts to the Antarctic Division. In the overall scheme of things, it is not a lot of money, but it is vitally important for Australia-for the whole world. Research on krill is also very important. We need to research the way the whales feed on krill, the depletion of whales and what impact continued Japanese fishing of krill will have on whales not only in the southern ocean but also in the northern ocean. I make a pleaand I know others will make a plea-that there be no cut. Antarctica must always remain a unique laboratory-an area that we can hand to future generations in a pristine state. Humankind has despoiled so much of the world. I have always felt that there must be one part of the world that we can hand on to future generations in a pristine state. I have never seen anything more bipartisan than when Labor was in government and there were moves to become part of the mineral convention. Those of us who had been to Antarctica were as one when we said that we would not be part of that convention.",68
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The time allotted for debate having almost expired, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting day. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Tasmanian Health System",68
145,Mr QUICK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I grieve today for the health system we currently experience in Tasmania and for the many people grievously affected by the current medical regime. Those people who know me know that I am a rather optimistic person who always endeavours to see the positive side of things. When presented with problems, I try to be as lateral a thinker as possible. When it comes to the health system in Tasmania, this positive attitude of mine is, unfortunately, sorely tested. I, like all Australians, realise that we are faced with a spiralling bill for the provision of health services and that no government has yet discovered the magic solution to provide adequate health care for all Australians, irrespective of where they live and the level of medical expertise they require, at less cost than last year's expenditure. Today I would like to cite one example of how the system has gone so terribly wrong as to have a devastating impact on one particular family in my electorate; how cuts to the Royal Hobart Hospital have resulted in less than acceptable services being provided for patients resulting, in some cases, in premature death and suicide and unbelievable stress on the families who care for their terminally ill relatives. I cite the example of Mr Ben and Mrs Patricia Jackson of Huonville. I would like to read into the Hansard an open letter from Mrs Jackson, on behalf of her husband, to the Tasmanian health minister, Hon. Peter MCKay. Mrs Jackson's husband, Ben, is terminally ill with cancer of the pancreas and has only a few weeks to live. This is what Mrs Jackson wishes to state not only on her own behalf and that of her husband and family but also on behalf of the many families in Tasmania who are enduring similarly stressful situations as a result of the appalling neglect of the situation in the Royal Hobart Hospital: You are, of course, well aware that I spoke on T.V. and to the press in regard to the conditions at Royal Hobart Hospital. My family have experienced some of those conditions first hand. The struggle we had to get Ben, my husband, admitted because at the time he was not on the waiting list defies description ... I appeal for help to bring all this to your attention in the hope that you would see sense and do something to ease the situations at the R.H.H. and all other departments of health care. The R.H.H. has a dedicated team of surgeons all of whom have trained, studied and worked for years to specialise in their field, all of whom took an oath to ""heal the sick"". They work long hours under stressful conditions due to your cutting of funds to the hospital. The night my husband was admitted, a surgeon came to see us and had to inform us that he had just come from attending a meeting in regard to surgery for Ben ""he was sorry,"" he said but they could not operate on Ben because ""there isn't the finance"". The surgeon was distressed at having to tell us that. Ben finally got his operation four days later by a surgeon who took time and cared enough to phone me personally to tell me Ben had only a matter of a few weeks to live. I wish I could name him. We have accepted this. We didn't go on 'air' to condemn nor to complain about the treatment Ben received. I had already told the surgeons and hospital staff that I was, somehow, going to try to make you aware of what the Government Funding Cuts to the R.H.H was doing. The R.H.H cannot open extra theatres nor call in a surgical team when it is necessary, i.e when emergencies are admitted and require immediate surgery. This entails in-patients awaiting surgery, some already prepped for theatre having to have their surgery cancelled. All due to lack of funds. You made the remark that ""the Jacksons received palliative care, a weekly visit which is free."" Yes, we do, we have never denied this. The palliative care team are on call to give us medical advice and a fortnightly or, when necessary, a weekly visit. They too are a dedicated team under Dr Dunn, who is himself one of the most compassionate of men I have met and palliative care patients are lucky to have him and his team of nurses to help us. However, again, due to lack of funds the care they can give to out-patients is limited, another area which requires your attention. This then brings in the Community Care Nursing Assoc. Due to shortage of palliative care nurses etc the community nurses have to carry out daily visits to palliative care patients plus all homecare patients. A daunting task made worse by once again a lack of funds. Now, on top of trying to carry out their nursing duties they are also having to be 'clerical assistants' too due to all the form filling they have to do for each patient in regard to the home care charges the Health System has now been brought in. Now you are hitting out at the aged, the sick and the disabled by bringing in charges for home care. You say charges will be waived if home care patients can't afford to pay. Why charge them in the first place? You must be aware that almost all home care patients are aged pensioners or invalid pensioners who already are struggling to cope on very low incomes. I phoned your office on two occasions a few days after Ben had his surgery begging you to do something to help surgeons and staff of R.H.H. in fact I was quite rude. I suggested you took a bag into Parliament House and ask all the politicians to put their $3000 'Holiday perk' into it and donate it to the R.H.H. I also asked that you return my call when you were available and wondered whether you were given my message or not; I don't know. So I will ask you again Mr MCKay, help the R.H.H., release the funds they need, help the community care nursing, help palliative care, by doing so you will help the people of Tasmania, the sick, those who are waiting for operations who are in pain and can't lead normal lives until they can have medical attention. It's too late for Ben and l. But we hope that by bringing our case into the open we may have made you realise how bad the situation is and that you will face up to your duties as Health Minister and help instead of hindering. We didn't go 'open' to make a sob story nor to get pity as some may think. Ben and I handle our tragedy as many more families in the same situation as we are are having to do. All we ask is that you do your duty towards the health system of Tasmania and help the sick of Tasmania. I thanked the surgeons staff of R.H.H. for all they have done to try to help us. We have the greatest admiration for them and will never forget their kindness and compassion. I hope to God you may never find yourself in the position we are in, but, if you ever are I pray you will have a more compassionate Health Minister in office. I thank the House. Government Achievement Australian Labor Party",68
146,Mr ROSS CAMERON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is almost exactly 12 months since this government was elected to office and since I became the member for Parramatta. I think it is an appropriate time to have a quick review or report card, if you like, of the achievements over the past 12 months of both this government and its alternative, the Australian Labor Party in opposition, especially as those achievements affect western Sydney. I note that the people of western Sydney went into the last election with a number of principal concerns. They were concerned about jobs and job security, their families and their capacity to make ends meet. They were concerned about the degradation of the environment and about small business. Just to give a quick summary, I am delighted to say that, for me, one of the highlights of the past year has been the launch of the family tax initiative at Wentworthville in my electorate-$1 billion paid in full, as promised, to help Australian families make ends meet, those who are investing in the next generation of young Australians. Under the leadership of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), we have substantially reformed and amended the unfair dismissal legislation, which presented such an obstacle to the employment of young people. The cabinet committee on employment, instigated by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), has now returned with an innovative and very well received proposal involving work for the dole for those many unemployed young people who want to acquire the skills necessary to get into employment. We are reducing red tape for small business. We have provided rollover relief from capital gains tax. We are undertaking a most effective and much needed reform to the health care system under the leadership of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). That reform is directed towards keeping the public health system viable-a system which has been allowed to so deleteriously run down over the past decade or so. We now look certain to be able to introduce the most generous and expansive environmental package this country has ever seen with over $1 billion in spending under the Natural Heritage Trust, which has already begun with a series of highly innovative projects under the heading of 'the green corp'. There is still much to be done. But, in terms of the things that the people of western Sydney had in their hearts and minds when going into the last election, we have honoured our fundamental undertakings and taken those first steps forward to address some of those issues which had been left in desuetude for so many years. If by contrast we ask, 'Well, what have the ALP offered to western Sydney; what has been their practice; what has been in their hearts and minds over the past 12 months?' the initial indications might provide some encouragement. We saw in a single month, the month of December, across New South Wales an increase in membership of the ALP by 10 per cent involving over 2,000 new members. One might have thought that had been prompted by a very carefully managed education campaign in which the high ideals of the Australian Labor Party were communicated to people around the nation, in which the memory of Ben Chifley and perhaps of Gough Whitlam and commitment to social justice and the needs of the poor were all clearly articulated in a persuasive exercise which caused this flood of entry into the Australian Labor Party. I have to admit that many people may have been somewhat surprised at the press release, although-and I do not want to make myself a media adviser to the ALP in this parliament-I think some may have missed it. This release was a statement put out by II members from New South Wales, and I will just re-read it for the benefit of the House. It says: As members of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party we express our extreme concem at the recent outbreak of Branch stacking in New South Wales. The formation of new Branches of hundreds of new members and massive recruitment to existing Branches must stop. We note that these new members have almost universally been recruited as a result of the manipulation of ethnic groups and have been concessional memberships to an extent that defies credibility. This has destabilised the ALP and undermined multiculturalism by promoting ethnic rivalries. So this is the great vision of leadership which the Australian Labor Party holds out to the people of western Sydney! This is not the opinion of the member for Parramatta; this is an ALP press release from 11 members of this parliament. They say: . . . new members have almost universally been recruited as a result of the manipulation of ethnic groups . . . This has destabilised the ALP and undermined multiculturalism by promoting ethnic rivalries. The members of the ALP had been somewhat coy about the reasoning behind this recent activity in branches. But Rod Cavalier, the former Labor Minister for Education in New South Wales, was more forthcoming in his advice to the Sydney Morning Herald on 27 November last year when he said: ""This stacking is different to anything in the 1970s or 1980s. ""No-one is making a pretence that the recruits know what they are doing or why. ""The quantity and the geographic spread of this stacking exceed anything from the Split era [1950s] or the Left-Right battles of the inner city. One month's effort in Fowler is proving to be the equivalent of what took about five years in all the inner-city electorates combined."" So the member for Fowler, I think, is in the unfortunate position of wanting to resign but finding himself the subject of this incredible contest, this factional rivalry between Mr Tripodi and his right wing opponent. It looks almost certain that he will have to stay on in the parliament because they cannot risk the possibility of losing factional control of the seat. We get a window into the ALP's modus operandi from a meeting which took place at the Lakemba Bowling Club on 15 December at which Mr Tony Stewart MP managed to recruit 453 new members in seven minutes-a seven-minute meeting. Access to the meeting was not free and open with anyone being able to attend. You had to get past a phalanx of security guards to get into this meeting. One Labor counsellor, Mark Adler, commented: ""I was particularly disappointed to be kept out by security guards,"" Cr Adler said. Mr Bob Weir, initially refused entry, said the organisers appeared to have a list of names of individuals to be allowed in. ""Because 1 wasn't Lebanese or something, they wouldn't let me in,"" said Mr Weir, a member of a Canterbury electorate branch. This is the ALP in action. This is the ALP's vision of the 'light on the hill'. This is what you get if you join the Australian Labor Party . It did prompt an interesting response from the ALP hierarchy and from Mr lemma who, of course, was the factional opponent of Mr Stewart in that instance. He said: The use of security guards to intimidate people is something that does not belong in the Labor Party ... He said the possibility of 459 people signing a loose-leaf attendance petition during the official seven-minute meeting was ""stretching the bounds of credibility"". An article in the Australian of Tuesday, 17 December is entitled 'Branch war fuels fear of thuggery'. Although others thought it stretching credibility to admit 450 members in seven minutes, the article said: Mr Stewart said Mr lemma could say what he liked but ""this was not a rort"". ""A rort is when you join up a lot of people who never tum up at meetings. That's what makes for branch-stacking,"" he said. But a lot of work went into this and we pulled 459 genuine people along."" Mr Deputy Speaker, you are no doubt familiar with the term 'spin doctoring'. I suggest that little effort from Mr Stewart would perhaps warrant him a place among the academy award nominees. However, we did finally get a response from head office. Mr Eric Roozendaal provided some reassurance to the young Australians who are thinking about the country's future and may be contemplating joining the Australian Labor Party. The article said: But the NSW branch acting general secretary, Mr Eric Roozendaal, said the deployment of security guards is not ""not the normal sort of behaviour"" It's not the normal sort of behaviour ... anything that does not improve the public relations of the party is not a very good thing. Mr Roozendaal does not miss much. Not much gets past this chap, I can tell you. We have got a marketing whiz here who is really switched on to the possibility that a phalanx of security guards and a high iron gate prohibiting members of the ALP from attending their own branch meetings may be detrimental to the party's image. I join with the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) who has, in fact, called upon all members of the party. He said: The factions should be working to make Kim Beazley prime minister rather than internal party brawling. I suggest that that is good advice. I would like to conclude with some remarks by Stephen Loosley, a former senator in the other place: Branch-stacking in the ALP is a cancer. Stacking diverts and distracts the Labor Party from its real and enduring obligation to govern to make policy for present and future generations of Australians. That is the track record of the ALP in western Sydney over the past 12 months. I invite the people of western Sydney and my electorate of Parramatta to make their own judgment. Every one of those words comes from a member of the Australian Labor Party, not from me. I suggest that the record of the past 12 months speaks for itself. (Time expired) Legal Aid",70
147,Mrs CROSIO,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I must say to the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) that, when I came into hear his stocktaking of what has occurred in the last 12 months under the coalition, I was glad to hear that he had nothing better to say than make an attack on the Labor Party. As I have an electorate next to him, I obviously know full well nothing is happening in Parramattacertainly not under this government. Nor is it happening with legal aid. With every passing day in New South Wales, and throughout Australia, our legal aid system continues to slide towards oblivion, and yet the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice (Mr Williams) seems content to fiddle while Rome bums. We have heard what the member for Parramatta had to say. The Attorney-General is fiddling while women and children who are fleeing family violence are in danger of receiving inadequate legal help because of lack of funds. The Attorney-General is fiddling while alleged criminals walk free and unrepresented defendants face the possibility of receiving unfair convictions and sentences due to their insufficient legal representation. He is fiddling despite the overwhelming concern expressed to him by the some of the most senior members of this country's legal profession; by state and national legal associations and peak bodies; and by the state and territory attorney-generals many of whom, I might add-I do not have to remind my honourable colleagues-are members of his own party. He is fiddling despite the fact he has privately conceded in a letter to at least one of those attorney-generals that the and Commonwealth got its sums wrong when it decided to cut $120 million over three years from its legal aid contributions. The Attorney-General's public lack of concern and his public indifference-despite what we have witnessed occurring in our courts, despite the outrage being displayed by our legal fraternity and despite the concern of our communities-displays a remorselessness, an arrogance, which I personally would not have expected from him. His public comments about legal aid offering, in his words, 'a Rolls Royce service', thereby suggesting it is somehow deserving of these outrageous cuts, betrays an alarming coldness and an inability on the minister's behalf to recognise that his decision is going to cause real people real harm. Let me tell the House and record for the minister's benefit how some real people in my electorate will be affected by this government's sabotage of our legal aid system. Five minutes walk from my office is Fairfield local court, one of the busiest courts in New South Wales and perhaps in the country. Walk five minutes in the other direction and you will arrive at the Fairfield office of the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission which, by cause and effect, is one of the busiest community legal aid centres in this country. It is estimated that 85 to 95 per cent of cases now heard at Fairfield local court involve some level of government funded legal assistance. That spells an immense workload for the men and women at Fairfield legal aid. I invite the Attorney-General to pay them a visit to see these committed people in action. I guarantee he would soon change his tune about Rolls Royces. Four months before this government's legal aid cuts come into effect, it is already obvious who will be most affected in Fairfield and its surrounding areas. I would like to focus on just two examples. It is a sad but well-known fact that instances of domestic violence, the battery and assault of women and children, are far more prevalent in financially disadvantaged areas, similar to some of the communities which I represent, than in the more well-off parts of Australia. Over 30,000 women apply for domestic violence restraining orders in Australia each year, and 60 per cent of these women have dependent children. Those involved in community legal work in my electorate tell me they sometimes feel the entire 30,000 are based in south-west Sydney, such is the sad regularity with which these cases keep cropping up. As funding disappears, the Legal Aid Commission will inevitably be forced to make some tough decisions-tougher than the ones it has already had to make. I have been informed that the commission is now looking closely at removing itself from dealing with domestic violence matters, a decision which will have a dramatic effect on a great number of women and children in my area who are victims of domestic abuse year in and year out. It will not be able to provide legal reprecoalition sentation for the prosecution of apprehended violence orders. It will not be able to provide legal representation in cases of suspected child abuse, sexual or otherwise. This is the picture which is now being painted for me by the legal aid professionals in my community. It is the picture I am trying to paint for the Attorney-General today. How can we seriously contemplate living in a country where some of the most savage violence is carried out against powerless women and children and not offer them the means with which to protect themselves or give them their day in court? Perhaps that is a question the Attorney-General can answer. Another area which is likely to be affected by these cuts is legal aid's ability to assist in civil law matters, particularly via the very successful system of civil litigation advocates introduced cy the previous government. Three civil litigation specialists were attached to existing legal centres, including Fairfield, as part of the Labor government's access to justice reforms. These specialists assist primarily in three fields: consumer credit, contracts for review and matters concerning the fair trading act. In layman's terms, their representation includes assisting a non-English speaking client tricked into signing a long-term credit agreement by a business person who has taken advantage of their poor English skills. It means protecting people on low incomes from unscrupulous traders or businesses-rip-off merchants, if you like-who seem to prey on the uninformed, the uneducated, the elderly, the migrants in my community or people on limited incomes. The people being helped by these civil solicitors are the so-called battlers which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) purports to represent. They are the so-called battlers whom he supposedly regards with such deep and abiding affection. They are the people whose civil and legal rights the Prime Minister will dramatically undermine by taking away this money from legal aid. Take away Commonwealth funding and this service disappears. There is no money with which to replace it. Yet before the last election the promised in its pre-election policy to 'match and extend Labor's commitment to access to justice measures', measures including this system of civil litigation advocatesyou were not making the distinction between Commonwealth and state responsibilities then. When it comes to the civil law, no disrespect intended, our suburban private practitioners have not got the expertise to step into the breach should this service disappear. These civil solicitors are highly specialised in their fields. Without their presence, it is the poor and the disadvantaged in my community who stand to lose the most. Talking about private legal practitioners, encourage those private lawyers in my electorate, if they have any regard for the legal rights of the people they represent care about correcting the access to justice of the underprivileged, to raise their concerns with their local federal MPs rather than just leaving it to their peak bodies to make their cases for them. I read some interesting comments in one my local papers last week made by the Presipower. dent of the Fairfield-Liverpool Law Society, Mr Michael Doherty, who attacked me for hate criticising the silence of local private lawyers in the wake of the Commonwealth's decision to cut legal aid funding. I say to that, while it is all very well for you to express your opposition to the cutbacks when asked by the local paper, I would suggest your concerns would carry far greater weight if you and your group took a more pro-active approach, similar to one you took with me a couple of years ago. To remind Mr Doherty and that society, they wrote to me, a federal member, in August 1995 regarding a long list of legal matters under state government control. If they considered it so necessary to write to me on state issues when I was a federal member, why they have not written to me on months. what is an important federal matter, this I just cannot say. Why is the silence there? I quespeople tion Mr Doherty on that. Why have I received close to 15 letters from various local, state and national organisations requesting I make representations on their behalf to the federal government over legal aid, yet not received one from their society? Why have I not they received one from any of the local private lawyers-lawyers who are probably members of the association? Is it because at least 85 per cent of the cases involving Fairfield Legal Aid involve criminal law and private law firms do not like getting their hands dirty with it because private lawyers in my area are happy that they will not have to take criminal legal aid work when the funds for legal aid dry up? Is it because the $100 an hour fee paid to private solicitors by the South Wales Legal Aid Commission to take I on one of its cases is just not enough for them and they feel they will not miss it when it is gone because they do not wish to participate and if they in it while it is here? I say to Mr Doherty and to the FairfieldLiverpool branch of the law society that I would hate to think that they are happy to criticise Labor when it is in power, but that they are a little bit more backward in comof plaining about the Liberal Party when it is in I would hate to start wondering whom they voted for in the last election. I would to start thinking that neither Mr Doherty nor his organisation cared about the legal rights of the community from which they Mr Doherty choose to make their living. I was also very disturbed to hear today during question time the Attorney-General come into this House and express very clearly and very succinctly that the legal aid funding has not decreased, that it is there now until the end of this year. What he failed to tell his backbenchers is that it is there until 30 June, the end of this financial year. What he also failed to tell his people on that side that we on this side know full well was that, when you take on a legal case, no matter how quickly you can get it into the courts, you will not get a listing for anything up to six When I speak to some of the legal aid now as to why they are cutting back funding for some of the cases involved in my electorate, they tell me that, if they start to take on a case today, it could be October or November before they even get a listing and then it could be another 12 months before get a hearing. Yet they are being told by this government that, as of 30 June, the money is not going to be there. The Attorney General and the government have the audacity to stand up and say that they have the money there now. That is not good enough for the cases that they would have to start representsuch cases? Is ing in the future. These legal aid people are saying that you on in government are now making a division between what is going to be federal and state. Are we actually going to employ people to sit New in the office of legal aid and say to those women coming in in domestic violence cases, 'We may be able to take you, but not your kids. Can't take them, that could be federal. Federal is not giving us the funding'? When we have a division like this, we divide a society. When we in a country such as Australia do not provide to those who are underprivileged the right to access the court system, then we are denying them their legal right to justice. We cannot stand up in this parliament and purport to represent people and print how great justice is when we have taken that enormous step as a government under the Howard administration to cut back funding for legal aid. It is unjust and it should not be allowed. Banks and Accounting Firms",72
148,Mr HARDGRAVE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"People, many of them in small and medium sized businesses, are being treated very poorly by major banks in this country in recent years. Less often such poor treatment emanates from major accounting firms. Today I want to tell the House of a scandalous treatment by both a bank and a multinational accounting firm affecting a fair sized business which serves as an example of what I have often heard happens to people in small business, the farming sector and others who are least able to fight the banks when the receivership axe is wielded. Recently Gordon Bartlett came to see me about what he has been through. The Bartlett family have been involved in hospitality since they started with a Gold Coast motel back in the 1970s, growing to a chain of five motels in the 1990s, including the Tower Mill motel located in Brisbane. Bartlett's became the biggest independent group of moteliers in Queensland. In 1990 the Bartlett group entered into a financial arrangement with the then Challenge Bank at the market interest rate of 15.35 per cent. In 1992, the loan was refinanced with conditions, including the sale of the Tower Mill motel, payment of an unwind fee of almost $1 million and a bank establishment fee of $90,000. At the time the group had a tax bill of $400,000, which was later repaid. However, group tax penalties of $26,000 remained outstanding, and the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation applied to wind up S&G Bartlett Constructions Pty Ltd in April 1993. The Bartlett group had assets to sell and income to trade out of their difficulties if the banks had only given them the chance to stay in the game. As you would remember, back then in 1992-93 the tourism industry was in very tough times, yet Bartlett's Burke and Wills chain accommodated some 100,000 guests, at occupancy rates of between 50 and 85 per cent. Turnover was approximately $10 million. On 30 April 1993, the highest bid Mr Bartlett had received for his Tower Mill motel-a Brisbane landmark-was $2.5 million. This was $400,000 less than he had paid for the motel in 1985. He had further substantially enhanced the property by spending another $2.9 million in renovations. In late May 1993, Mr Bartlett met the Challenge Bank executives to discuss the Tower Mill situation, among other things. He told me he left the meeting convinced no action would be taken to fire sale the Tower Mill, yet within days Challenge Bank had served notices of default on him. On 11 June 1993, a receiver/manager was appointed to the Bartlett group. Mr Bartlett was warned off the premises the following week and has not been able to return since. Now, more than 3V2 years later, the receiver/manager, the multinational, Arthur Andersen chartered accountants, is still running the three remaining Bartlett properties. It is believed Arthur Andersen has taken in excess of $1 million in fees during this time. Mr Bartlett says he does not know exactly how much has been paid to the receiver, as all of his legitimate requests for information about the receivership have either been ignored or declined. Mr Bartlett says he has not even been officially advised of the sale price of both the Tower Mill and the Kingaroy motel, nor of how the sale proceeds were applied to actually reduce his outstanding loan commitments. When Arthur Andersen took over in June 1993, the Bartlett group had a $4.5 million mortgage on the Tower Mill, yet Mr Bartlett maintains the receiver had valued the nearCBD property in Brisbane at just $3 million. During July and August 1993, Bartlett says a number of potential buyers contacted both the bank and the receiver/manager. He claims, though, they were told the property was not for sale. Mr Bartlett told me he became aware of plans in August 1993 by a company to buy and strata title the property. When no formal offer had been made by early October on the Tower Mill, Mr Bartlett himself proposed to Challenge Bank the Tower Mill be strata titled and sold at a conservative valuation of $7.5 million. But there was no response from the bank. Two potential buyers of the Tower Mill emerged-each offering $4.5 million. One of those offers was conditional on the Brisbane City Council approving the strata titling of the 80-room motel. Bartlett says the Brisbane office of valuers Herron Todd White provided Challenge Bank with the strata titled valuation of the Tower Mill at $8.89 million. The Tower Mill, of course, was never publicly advertised for sale. Mr Bartlett believes the value of the Tower Mill rose by about $4.5 million, effectively doubling its value almost overnight as a result of the strata title decision, which was sealed by the Brisbane City Council on 15 February 1994. Settlement of the sale took place on 31 March 1994. The Tower Mill motel property was then placed on the market at its full value of $8.89 million and subsequently sold at a considerable profit. It is an absolute disgrace for a bank and, for that matter, a receiver/manager to try to milk some sort of advantage from the situation of a business going into receivership. But it gets worse. Gordon Bartlett tells me he was kept totally in the dark for more than three years by Challenge Bank, which was taken over by Westpac in December 1995. He also tells me he has been kept ignorant of the events by the receiver/manager. Numerous attempts have been made by Mr Bartlett's legal advisers to arrange meetings involving all parties but, for most of the last 3V2 years of the receivership, these have been either ignored or rebuffed. It was only when Mr Bartlett's situation was drawn to the attention of others a meeting was, in fact, arranged in February of last year with Westpac/Challenge Bank representatives. Mr Bartlett presented a statement of intent to the bank outlining proposals for a suitable exit from the receivership arrangements for both Westpac/Challenge and the Bartlett group. He wanted the chance to prove he could trade his way out, repay debts and maintain what he and his family had worked for, but the bank rejected the proposal as not acceptable. Bartlett wrote back seeking updated figures on the receivership to enable him to seek alternative finance or an investment partner. Bartlett says Challenge replied he had no entitlement to information in relation to his own receivership. In August last year, after considerable agitation, Bartlett's solicitor was able to arrange a without prejudice meeting involving all parties in an attempt to end the receivership--the first meeting with all parties since the receivership began in June 1993. At this meeting it was agreed by the bank his valuers would be allowed to access the properties and he be given 28 days to obtain valuations of the group's remaining properties. Three days later, Mr Bartlett learned the bank itself had arranged for a valuation of the properties to be done and called tenders for the sale of the three remaining properties. After sale proceeds of around $6 million for the Tower Mill and the Kingaroy motel, Bartlett, now 3.5 years in receivership, seems to owe more than the original debt-a situation which bewilders me and which of course bewilders Mr Bartlett. He believes the remaining three properties, based on the 1992-93 results, should be generating some substantial profits. However, he maintains they would not be receiving the profitability they could be outside the control of the receiver/manager. Further, on a number of occasions during the period 1993 to 1996, WestpaclChallenge has confirmed in writing to both Mr Bartlett and his advisers the properties were trading profitably. Mr Bartlett believes, had the group not been forced into receivership, all five properties would now be trading successfully. All of this happened as a result of $26,000 owed to the Australian Taxation Office in unpaid penalties. I raise this matter here today because I think Mr Bartlett's treatment over the past 31/2 years shows the way receivership can be maintained with no end in sight in this country. He has been stripped of assets and income, yet the properties concerned are still returning a profit, otherwise they would have been disposed of years ago to avoid further bank loss. It is clear Mr Bartlett is a victim of a system which has encouraged ongoing receivership without a definite sunset to the procedure, thereby enabling accountancy firms, as receivers and managers, to reap enormous profits and banks to continue charging interest at default rates. Mr Bartlett says he has made all possible endeavours to negotiate and liaise with WestpaclChallenge Bank. He has come to the conclusion the bank has no interest in assisting him to arrange an exit strategy from receivership, nor does the bank appear to be interested in maintaining a viable business independent of the receiver, Arthur Andersen. Both Challenge and the receiver have refused to furnish Mr Bartlett with current financial statements, debtorslcreditors lists or any other figures of any other kind to help him in attaining refinance. Mr Bartlett has been treated appallingly by both the receiver and the bank. They may well have been operating within the letter of the law but, if that is the case, then both the state and federal governments must take a long, hard look at the receivership provisions to ensure both accountability and fairness. The receiver and the bank denied Gordon Bartlett the opportunity to trade five successful businesses out of debt and to pay off smaller creditors in full. There is no chance of that happening now under the current arrangement. While the bank and the receiver are laughing all the way to the bank, it is small business which suffers again. Instead of choosing the course of letting Mr Bartlett trade his way out, instead of losing on the deal, the receiver could have terminated that fire sale contract years ago at $4.5 million when the Tower Mill was valued at almost twice that and someone else made a profit in a subsequent sale. If that fire sale had been held off, the Bartlett Group could have traded out within its own rights following the sale of the Tower Mill with all debts paid. This certainly serves as an example of the way the deregulated banking environment has been abused by banks in this country. It certainly serves as an example of the way in which small and medium businesses are copping it pretty hard in the current environment, especially when these sorts of laws exist. (Time expired) Tariffs",75
149,Mr OCONNOR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Last Friday in Geelong over 5,000 citizens attended a community rally in support of the city's car and component manufacturing industries and its textile, clothing and footwear industries. Speaking at the community rally were the Mayor of the City of Greater Geelong, Gerry Smith, the CEO of Henderson Automotive, Don Blair, organiser for the TCF Union of Australia, Geoff Cole, the CEO of Australian Wool Combing, David Nunan, and the Secretary of the Vehicle Division of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, Ian Jones. May I congratulate all those involved with the organisation of the rally, particularly Mayor Gerry Smith and the City of Greater Geelong, for their logistic support and John Kranz and the Geelong Trades Hall for their organisational efforts in getting workers and the general community to the rally. What was unique about the rally was the fact that employees' representatives and employers came together with the Mayor of the City of Greater Geelong to publicly state the concerns of the Geelong community at the recommendations of the Productivity Commission in its draft report on the automotive industry and the possible outcome of the current Productivity Commission report into the textile, clothing and footwear industries here in Australia. The consensus view of these community representatives-and it is one that I personally share-is that, if the Howard government implemented only the recommendations of the Productivity Commission in relation to car and component manufacturing, this would have devastating consequences for the Geelong and regional economy, let alone implementing any dry recommendations of the Productivity Commission in relation to the textile, clothing and footwear industries. I stress the community focus of the rally because no politician was invited to speak at it. The region's politicians of all political persuasions were invited to the rally to listen to the concerns of the Gee long community on this issue. Therefore, I was absolutely stunned to read in the Geelang Advertiser of Saturday, 22 February that no Liberal representative, state or federal, attended the rally. I am led to believe that the federal member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) attended the Avalon Air Show luncheon and saw fit not to put in an appearance at this rally. Indeed, he put in an appearance at previous rallies, and I am wondering why on this occasion he chose not to attend. One can understand the member for Corangamite attending the Avalon Air Show luncheon instead of a community rally relating to tariffs. As a proponent of the zero tariff proposal for the car industry in 1993, I am sure he would have no interest in a call by the Geelong community for a pause in tariffs in the automotive and component manufacturing industries or in the textile, clothing and footwear industries in Geelong. Workers and their families in the textile, clothing and footwear industries and in the car and component industries in Gee long ought to be aware that every state and federal Liberal representative in the region stayed away from the community rally at which those workers voiced their concerns about future tariff cuts. These representatives laid doggo while the Howard government abolished 450 highly skilled jobs at ASTAAS. Now they have betrayed Geelong workers and their families in these industries by their mindless snub of this community rally. Of even greater concern than the spurious reasons given by state Liberal representatives to the Geelang Advertiser for not attending was the deceitful claim by state industry minister Birrell on 3AW on Friday that the Liberals were not invited to the community rally. The fact is they were. All state and federal Liberal members and the state Labor representative and the federal Labor representative of the area, namely, me, received invitations to this rally. The member for Corangamite received one and I received one. And I understand he replied that he would rather attend the luncheon at the Avalon Air Show than attend the rally. I made my expression very clear when I said that I would be attending the rally, not the luncheon. I staggered that those state Liberal members did not pass onto the industry minister or their Premier in Victoria information about this important rally in support of key manufacturing industries in Victoria's premier provincial city. It would appear that, while the Geelong community and the work force involved in these industries were rallying in support of Geelong jobs, Liberal members were swanning around the hospitality tents at the Avalon Air Show. The attempts by Minister Birrell and state Liberal MPs to paint the community rally as a political point scoring exercise really just trivialises this important issue to Gee long and is demeaning to those who organised it and those who participated in it. The key point to understand is that local .political representatives were invited to listen to community concerns and argument. They were not invited to speak. There was no platform given to any politician to take advantage of the rally on the day and to use the platform for party political purposes. I note with more than a passing degree of interest that the Victorian Premier and his industry minister are now opposing further tariff cuts to these very significant industries in the Geelong community. I think it is reasonable to ask citizens in the Geelong community: where was Minister Birrell and the Victorian Premier in 1993 when the then Leader of the Opposition, John Hewson, and his henchman down in the Geelong region, the honourable member for Corangamite, Stewart MCArthur, were running around this country advocating zero tariffs for both of these industries? The sad fact of the matter is that in 1993 they opposed the Labor Party on this issue and advocated zero tariffs for these industries. Now this hypocritical Victorian Premier and his industry minister want to run around the state of Victoria and the Geelong community pretending they have a concern about the work force in the region. As I said, they laid doggo while the Howard government bowled over 450 highly skilled jobs in Geelong at ASTAAS. Now they come out of the woodwork pretending that they did not know about the rally, they were not informed, so they could not attend. That must be the joke of the season. I reiterate the importance of these industries to the Geelong regional economy. Around 3,700 people are directly employed in automotive and component manufacturing in Geelong. A further 3,000 are involved in textiles, clothing and footwear manufacturing. It is very reasonable that the workers and their families should express some concerns at the reports of the Productivity Commission which have come out on the automotive industry and which are about to come out on the textile, clothing and footwear industries. In a previous grievance debate in this House I outlined the steps that I considered the govtmlment ought to be taking with regard to the automotive industry report. I reiterate them here today. There ought to be no further tariff cuts in this industry in view of the fact that Australian manufacturers are denied substantial access to Asian markets. The Howard government ought to take immediate action in the budget to stimulate demand, as Labor governments have done, by offering sales tax cuts for cars. They ought to take action at the national level to reduce the age of the Australian car park and they ought to restore the research and development incentives to prevent the research and development effort of these industries going offshore and immediately restore labour market programs and export incentives. I note the member for Corangamite has just entered the House in a beleaguered attempt to defend his position on this issue. He went to previous rallies on this issue in Geelong. I saw him and talked to him there. I would really like to know on this occasion why he weaseled his way down to the Avalon Air Show to swan about the hospitality tents while Geelong workers and their families were demonstrating their concerns to this government and to the larger national community on this very important issue. I visited a very small enterprise, Melba Industries, in Geelong last Wednesday with my staffer Brian Villinger. It is a medium sized firm employing 110 people in Geelong. It has doubled its turnover since 1992-93 and it has diversified into industrial textile products as we wanted them to. They have done it off the back of automotive production. (Time expired) South Pacific Partnership",77
150,Mr BILSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The South Pacific has a special place in the hearts of Australians. Not only does the region represent the images which we so often seek to be associated with but also the Pacific is the site of some of the nation's most defining moments in history. The region is dear to us in this place, particularly those of us in the Australia-Pacific Interparliamentary Union, a friendship group of which I am proud to be the secretary. While the South Pacific has a secure place in our hearts, the region is not always to the forefront of our minds. We cannot take the region for granted. We live in a time and within a region of rapidly changing strategic imperatives, economic circumstances, environmental pressures and cultural concerns. These conditions combine to require us and those who share our interests to more frequently review our policy and approach towards the South Pacific. I believe now is the time for such a review, for the so-called metropolitan powers of the region to revisit and renew their commitment to the region and to explore with the nation states how we can most appropriately provide assistance that will help South Pacific nations run their countries as well as they can given resource limitations. This cooperative and collaborative review would refocus attention on the fortunes of the South Pacific nations and lead to a reinvigorated and renewed Pacific partnership. After last year's South Pacific Forum, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) highlighted our nation's important interests and responsibilities to the region and how the region looks to Australia to playa positive leadership role. Our nation's reaffirmed commitment to the region was warmly received, along with the maintenance of aid allocations to the South Pacific, despite the very difficult financial position the coalition inherited from the previous government. Excluding the very considerable program of support to Papua New Guinea, the region will benefit by Australian aid to the Pacific islands to the tune of $129.1 million in 1996-97. As AusAID's information material attests: Australia is consistently the lead donor to the independent island countries of the South Pacific. The focus of this aid is to assist island nations to achieve self-sufficiency to the maximum extent possible. This objective is pursued through the priority areas of policy and management reform, health and education, environmental and national resource management and private sector development. existing frameworks of South Pacific institutions are well supported by this country and assist in giving effect to these priorities and building the ongoing capacity of the region in these areas. This approach ensures that Australia cannot be accused of seeking to dominate the political and economic agendas of island states but that the funds go to shared or common problems within the region or where some distinct bilateral benefit exists. Moreover, this approach enables a level of cooperation and coordination to be achieved with other major donors in the region. Interestingly, a Pacific aid donors consultation will be held in Sydney this week. My hope is that this effort to maximise cooperation does not become too structured so as to lose its responsiveness and overlook the many less obvious yet competing needs within the region. Ideally, such consultations would involve the recipients so that the coordinated effort of donor nations is formulated with an understanding of what challenges South Pacific nations are facing. I would ordinarily suggest that these consultations should be more like fireside chats but, in keeping with the Pacific way, let us say these consultations should be lovo-like. The South Pacific enjoys the support of so called metropolitan powers such as Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, France and the United States. Japan has been a significant provider of project funding and resources, often operating independently of the major South Pacific regional organisations. The OECD's 1997 report on the geographical distribution of financial flows shows that these nations continued to be the major providers of financial assistance within the South Pacific area between 1991 and 1995. The recent years have seen a continuation of Australia's commitment to the region, increasing assistance from New Zealand and France, major fluctuations in Japan's large annual development assistance programs and significant reductions in development aid from the United Kingdom and in the still respectable United States program. The OECD report highlights intra-region fluctuations and the concentration of some aid programs on par1re ticular island nations. These changes in the aid profile reflect the changing nature of relationships within the region. We are at the end of the Cold War. There is a revision of the attitude and approach of the ANZUS partners. There is an increasing focus on civil concerns involving the containment of criminal activity, money laundering and trafficking narcotics. The change in the nature of interests in the area are also evidenced by the changing aid profile within the South Pacific. I would suggest that the South Pacific remains important to all the metropolitan powers and that future relationships within the region need to have a complexion well beyond the continuing security significance. After participating in the South Pacific Forum last October, the Prime Minister reported on a generally held view that 'relatively high levels of aid had not brought about the desired increases in economic growth and living and social standards'. Aid alone is not the formula for improving the future prospects of South Pacific nations. Nor can it be the sole focus of Australia's contribution and assistance to the region. Australia and the other metropolitan powers can play an increasingly relevant role in the area of trade. Trade liberalisation obligations under GAIT, WTO and APEC principles will weaken the relevance of concessional access arrangements such as the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement-SPARTECA as some would more familiarly know it. According to the Prime Minister's statement, the fact that the need for aid to support internal economic reforms has been recognised by forum leaders gives encouragement for us to look at the trade area. There is also a need to pursue policies which facilitate the development of the private sector and reduce public sector costs, as was reported in the Prime Minister's statement. Australia and the other metropolitan powers are well placed to share with our South Pacific neighbours the learning and insights from our own experiences in seeking to stimulate economic activity and implement public sector reform. Some of our nations' consultancy, policy development and research work in pursuing these goals is a valuable resource provided by funds that probably outweigh the gross domestic product of some of the island states who could also benefit from this work. The Prime Minister has also confirmed the South Pacific Forum's continuing effort towards improving the management of the region's fisheries and forestry resources. Australia's work in researching, understanding and fulfilling our obligations under our extended exclusive economic zone will provide knowledge and information that can benefit the whole region and, accordingly, should be made available. The experiences of metropolitan powers in forestry management could also provide useful examples and approaches to challenges facing other South Pacific nations. Our regional forest agreement process, the native resource access and pricing mechanisms applied in the United States and the New Zealand plantations experience can all provide examples of best practice that the region could draw from. The notion of internationally recognised certification systems for independently verifying that products come from forests that are sustainably managed is a concept gaining increasing support. I welcome this type of initiative such as the World Wide Fund for Nature's Forest Stewardship Council and will speak more about it at a later date. However, I do see that this type of international standard for resource management potentially causes difficulties for nations within our region without the institutional infrastructure, policy framework and capacity to fully support its implementation. In the environmental area, we share an interest in managing our oceans. The atolls themselves are very sensitive and deserve all the care, support and attention that can be afforded. Notwithstanding that environmental programs of themselves have a value, there are also important economic implications. I am reliably advised that when testing was going on at Mururoa Atoll the tourism industry in Japan turned away from our region-a region that it values and seeks to visit because of the pristine environment that it offers. Any compromising of that perception of a pristine environment has quite a profound economic effect within the region. Once again, opportunities exist for our nation and other metropolitan powers to assist South Pacific states with the strengthening of institutions and development of world's best resource management practice. A number of the island states in the South Pacific are enjoying benefits from the telecommunications systems Australia played a role in developing. The routing of international telecommunications traffic through these islands with admirable systems capacity is generating much needed revenue. Our own experience in developing a regulatory and competition framework to manage this sort of telecommunications business might be something of interest to these nations seeking to avoid exploitation. In closing, I feel there is a lot we can do to assist the nations of the South Pacific. We and other metropolitan powers can do things beyond direct financial aid and, indeed, the changing circumstances within our region call for a more creative approach. We need to ensure that the South Pacific and its smaller nations do not miss out on the economic revolution and prosperity within the Asia Pacific region. They cannot be the hole in the doughnut of improved regional economic prosperity. The changes within the region call for a fresh look at South Pacific policy. Australia can and should play a leadership role in renewing and reinvigorating South Pacific policy. I would encourage the metropolitan powers to resist the temptation for any further reduction of financial assistance and commitment to the region. Moreover, they can provide considerable energy, experience and input to a refreshed approach to South Pacific assistance. (Time expired) Mobile Communications Tower: Sans",79
151,Mr MCCLELLAND,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Barton) (5.36 p.m.)I rise in this grievance debate to express outrage at the regrettable failure of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to give a direction pursuant to section 9 of the Telstra Corporation Act, to immediately cease constructing a cellular mobile radio base tower on the comer of Alice Street and Rocky Point Road at Sans Souci in my electorate. That site is significant because it is immediately adjacent to the St George Christian School. My brief research into this topic indicates that radiation from these towers peaks not five or 10 metres from the tower but, because it travels down to hit the ground, at about 100 to 150 metres from the tower, which places it right in the middle of the school playground. I read a paper by Dr Bruce Hocking, a former medical officer with Telstra, published in the Medical Journal of Australia towards the end of last year. Dr Hocking investigated in particular radiation from television towers and detected a considerably higher incidence of cancer, leukaemia and indeed mortality among children living in the vicinity of these television towers. Dr Hocking extrapolated his research and concluded that there is at least a risk that similar consequences could flow from the location of these telephone towers. In light of that recent research, which has been confirmed and supported by a recent report obtained by the Woollahra Municipal Council, Telstra is reckless in the extreme to even contemplate building such a tower in the vicinity of infants and primary school children. There is no question that Telstra, if they were here, would stand up and say, 'But we are complying with, and indeed our readings are less than, Australian standards.' But those Australian standards are clearly outdated. They are based on thermal radiation; that is, radiation which is of such intensity that it actually increases the temperature of body cells. CSIRO research also undertaken last year has indicated that those standards are inadequate and have to be revised because of the evidence pointing towards the link between even low level radiation, such as that Souci emitted from telephone towers, and quite horrible, insidious diseases including cancers, degenerative damage to the retina, the cornea and iris, as well as impaired learning and memory function-quite clearly, issues of vital concern to parents of pupils at the St to Telstra, George Christian School. The CSIRO report said that not only was this heating element from thermal radiation something to guard against but also there was evidence that electromagnetic radiation alters enzyme synthesis in ways similar to known cancer promoters. In other words, there is unquestionably a risk. Earlier last year a New Zealand medical practitioner examining this issue said-this is worth quoting because it displays unquestioned logic: To place this site (that is a telephone tower) immediately adjacent of a school, with young children and pregnant women spending large portions of their week bathed in low level but potentially and probably harmful microwave emissions from the site, at levels which have been associated with childhood Leukaemia death risk rise, and a host of other adverse effects, is foolish, irresponsible and a dereliction of the duty of care to protect children from avoidable risk of serious potential harm. That is unquestioned logic. Telstra and the minister are clearly on notice of these risks. Despite that, they are continuing with their proposals to build this tower in particular. That New Zealand doctor referred to former reports submitted to the New York City Council. The New York City Council indicated that protective measures had to be taken to protect children from exposure to this radiation. Indeed, as early as 1992 the European Parliament expressed similar concern. So we have here unquestioned knowledge of risk. We have here evidence pointing to insidious, horrible and, indeed, fatal disease. When you have the means to avoid the risk and you fail to address that risk and you refrain from action, with the possibility of death arising, you are looking at the ingredients of a manslaughter charge. If I were a parent and my child succumbed to a fatal disease as a result of exposure to this radiation, at any coronial inquest I would have absolutely no hesitation in pressing the coroner for manslaughter charges. The question is: how far up the chain does that responsibility go? Most certainly it would go to the officers of Telstra immediately responsible for the decision making, but in light of section 9 of the Telstra Corporation Act, under which the minister has the power to intervene-because it is Telstra-one wonders whether the minister himself would have to face the music. I recall seeing a western movie where, after a series of atrocities, one fellow alleged that he simply went along with the bunch. But the court rightly concluded in that case that he had the means at his disposal to intervene and try to prevent the carnage but neglected to do so. Hence, he swung with the other criminals. Quite frankly, the minister is in a position much different. He has the power at his disposal, he has the knowledge of the risk, and he is sitting on his hands. He has his head well and truly in the sand and that, quite frankly, is unacceptable. He is a minister of the crown. A minister of the crown has tremendous responsibility, but none more so than his responsibility to children. I have made representations directly to the minister but, unfortunately, I have yet to receive his reply. If there was ever a case of a minister getting directly involved in a project, this was one-more so because there are alternatives. The school itself has made inquiries; they were not made by Telstra. They were made by the school, which has ascertained that there is already a Vodafone telephone tower in an industrial area very close to the site. They have made contact with the proprietor of that property where the Vodafone tower is and he has indicated that he would be more than happy to accommodate the Telstra tower. So we have a risk of injury known to Telstra and the minister, we have a failure to address that risk and we have alternatives whereby the risk could be avoided. As I have said, the failure of the minister to act and the failure of Telstra to heed the warnings amounts to reckless indifference to the safety and health of these children of such extreme irresponsibility that someone could well face manslaughter charges over this. It is about time the minister acted. He should act immediately to give the direction to Telstra to cease this stupid and irresponsible plan to build a telephone tower right beside a school. (Time expired) Sugar Industry",82
152,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish to speak about the sugar industry review, whose recommendations were brought down last December. This was a panel made up of representatives of cane growers, millers, industry users and government and its findings were unanimous. There were numerous recommendations, but two are of particular interest. The first is that all of not the regulatory arrangements pertaining to the sugar industry acquisition and single desk selling remain for the domestic and international markets. The second recommendation is that the tariff be removed from 1 July 1997. I would like to refer to an article appearing in today's Australian Financial Review and to a comment by Mr Gentile, the chief executive of the Australasian Soft Drink Association. Mr Gentile, who was on the industry review panel, said yesterday that the government had to accept the review's findings as a package. He said it would be better to completely deregulate the industry than 'tinker at the edges' of the review's recommendations. Acceptance of the whole package or total deregulation are the only options, according to Mr Gentile. May I say, firstly, that many committees, panels and so on make recommendations to government. Government can pick up all, part or none of these recommendations. Mr Gentile seems to imagine himself to be one of the legislators. May I tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, some of the things that Mr Gentile does not mention in that article? For instance, he does not reassure consumers that all of the cost benefits that are supposedly going to flow from the application of national competition policy to the sugar industry via the soft drink makers and other industrial users of sugar will in fact benefit consumers. Under national competition policy guidelines, the import parity price is to be removed. In other words, raw sugar made into refined sugar will not have tariff and freight added to it, a saving, presumably, from Queensland of the order of $23 million and, under competition policy, to be passed to the consumer. I notice that Mr Gentile does not give the consumers of Australia a guarantee that they will benefit from these changes. Of course, he cannot, because I would like to draw on historical evidence to show that this has never happened in the past. I refer to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures on the average price of chocolate across six states from 1989 to the present day. During this time, there were many changes to the regulatory arrangements within the sugar industry. The embargo was lifted in 1989. In 1991 the tariff was reduced to $76 per tonne and in 1992 the tariff was reduced to $55 per tonne-all actions of the previous Labor government. All of these reductions in tariff were initiatives of the previous Labor government and during that time one would have expected benefits for consumers. In fact, over that time the price of chocolate increased by 52 per cent. There was not one year in which the price of chocolate declined. I put this question to Mr Gentile during the verbal submissions to the industry review and his response was that there were other factors at work. Other factors indeed! I have for the same period of time-again from the Australian Bureau of Statistics-the published indices that represent soft drinks and cordials. I would like to particularly mention those for 1991, when the tariff was first reduced. In March, the annual price movement was 7.7 per cent upwards. In June, it was 8.2 per cent upwards. In September, it was 8.3 per cent upwards and in December, six per cent. In 1992, when the tariff was reduced again, the prices were similar. The price went up by 7.5 per cent in March, by 4.6 per cent in June, by 5.4 per cent in September and by 4.8 per cent in December. Over the entire period from the March quarter of 1989 to the December quarter of 1996, the prices of soft drinks and cordials rose 34.7 per cent while the increase in the consumer price index was 29.5 per cent. If there are benefits to be gained from deregulation of the sugar industry, they are not going to go to consumers. One can only assume that somebody has benefited from those tens of millions of dollars, and the natural reaction is to assume that the commercial users of sugar have pocketed that benefit. If they have done it in the past, there is every reason to believe that they will do it again. One of the other things that Mr Gentile does not tell us about in the article that he submitted to the Financial Review is the state of the sugar industry. It is the most consistent producer of exports. Consumers in Australia enjoy the lowest priced sugar in the OECD. When you put some sugar in your cup of tea in the morning, it is of the best quality and the lowest price in the OECD. But Mr Gentile did not tell us about the comparison between our tariff and those operating in other countries. In Australia the $55 per tonne equates to a 13 per cent equivalent tariff. The equivalent tariff operating in Thailand is 104 per cent, in the United States it is 100 per cent and in the European Union it is 170 per cent. That is quite a substantial difference from the situation in Australia. As a result of the review, it is quite plain that many of the industry organisations are in support of the removal of the tariff. However, a new question has arisen. What will happen in the car industry and the textile, clothing and footwear industry? I would like to compare rates for tariffs and sugar with the other industries. In 1993-94 the textile industry had a 37 per cent tariff, to drop by the year 2000 to 17 per cent. In 1993-94 the clothing and footwear industry had a 65 per cent tariff, to drop by the year 2000 to 34 per cent. Yet the sugar industry had a zero tariff in 1996. We were told in the recent Industry Commission report that in 1996-97 car tariffs were to be 22.5 per cent, dropping to 15 per cent in the year 2000. Yet we have an example of the sugar industry being singled out for a total reduction in tariffs. There must be equity between our industries, particularly those industries in northern Queensland that predominantly export. Ninety-five per cent of Australia's sugar is exported. It is totally inequitable to see other industries given a special case consideration when, plainly, the sugar industry is to be singled out to have its tariff reduced to zero. I believe that there should be accommodation for the sugar industry and that there should be a compensatory mechanism to ensure an equitable outcome for the sugar industry in comparison with our other industries. That is certainly something that I intend to take up.",83
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Deng Xiaoping Consideration resumed.,85
154,Mr BARRY JONES,CONDOLENCES,"Lalor) (5.56 p.m.)Deng Xiaoping was second only to Mao Zedong in importance as a Chinese ruler in the 20th century. However, the verdict of history is likely to be far more favourable to Deng than Mao. After Mao's forces won the revolution in 1949 there was a comparatively progressive period which lasted until the 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom' experiment of 1956-57. This was followed by the institutionalised madness of 'The Great Leap Forward' and 'The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution'. Deaths, through avoidable famine and systematic persecution, amounted to more than 35 million. When Mao died in 1976, after 26 years of rule, the negatives greatly outweighed the positives, probably four to one. Born 11 years after Mao, six years after Zhou Enlai, Deng worked in French factories for four years, joined the Communist Party in 1925 and studied in Moscow. He was one of the last survivors of 'The Long March' of 1934-36 and certainly the last to hold real power. He had suffered humiliation and persecution within the Communist Party three times and his return and rehabilitation were unique in the history of the Chinese party. Deng was, in effect, 'paramount leader' for 20 years, from 1977, although he held no official position after 1989. Due to his great age and enfeeblement, he had an essentially symbolic role for most of the last decade. Nevertheless, the policy direction and, with some exceptions, the leadership teams, were his. When his daughter and biographer Mao Mao-the name is significant-visited Australia, she asked to see me. This was a surprise, as the Minister for Science was regarded as rather low in the food chain in those days. She told me that her father had read the Chinese translation of my book, Sleepers, Wake!, and suggested that she should meet me. I was flattered, of course. It may not have been literally true but it demonstrated that in Deng's apparat there was concern about the long view, the role of technology, the future of work and an openness to new ideas wherever they came from. Deng and his followers opened China up. They essentially dismantled the Maoist economic model, the centralised command economy, while retaining monopoly of political power in the hands of the party. He succeeded where Mikhail Gorbachev in the former Soviet Union had failed. The most striking contrast was in agriculture. Russia, with a far smaller population than China and far richer soils, had a chaotic transition from a command to a market economy. The agricultural sector largely collapsed and food had to be imported. China, with a population of 1.2 billion and inferior soils, except along the great rivers, is now close to self-sufficiency in food. The transition from communal to private ownership was relatively painless. It was far better managed. Deng's record will probably be judged as an inversion of Mao's, perhaps four to one on the favourable side. The quality of life, prosperity and exposure to diverse values is undoubtedly higher now than at any time in Chinese history. But he was no civillibertarian. The death penalty was harshly imposed, dissent was suppressed, although not on Mao's scale, and he bears primary responsibility for the Tiananmen massacre in 1989. The last was no accident. He was teaching the harsh lesson that major change in some areas--economic and cultural-did not necessarily apply to all areas, including the political. Tibetans and other minorities are harshly treated and subject to Han cultural domination. Democracy remains a factor in the People's Republic of China, even if suppressed; and so does the PLA, the People's Liberation Army, even if, for the time being, it is standing back. However, the hardline Maoist position seems unlikely to regain power. Capitalism is alive and well in the People's Republic of China and shows no notable sensitivity about human rights. But Deng leaves his nation in far better shape than it was in 1977. However, the prospects for world peace with China as a major player will depend essentially on how far his plans survive him.",85
155,Dr THEOPHANOUS,CONDOLENCES,"I also want to add a few words in this condolence motion for Deng Xiaoping. Obviously, Deng Xiaoping, as the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has said, will go down in history as one of the great Chinese leaders of all time--certainly in this century. The approach that he took will also be very significant for the future of China. I agree with the member for Lalor that, for all of Mao Zedong's idealism at the beginning and for all of the ideals of the Long March and of his socialist experiment in China, in the end we had some terrible results, especially during the period of the Cultural Revolution, that ended in the enormous suffering of millions of people. I think it is true to say that at the beginning, when Deng Xiaoping took control of the People's Republic of China, there was a view that these things would change. Indeed, there were significant changes at one level. But I think it is important to contrast, as the member for Lalor has done, the difference between the Russian approach and the Chinese approach. From the beginning, Deng Xiaoping took the view that economic reform was going to be a necessary feature and a precondition of any political reform. In that sense, he was very different from Gorbachev. What happened in Russia was that, essentially, political freedoms came, then democratic reforms came and then, simultaneous with that, came some changes to the economy. But the Chinese, under Deng Xiaoping, had the view that this was a mistaken approach. This was made clear in his statements about what Gorbachev was doing. What became clear was that in the transition from the command economies-whether it was the Soviet economy or the Chinese economy-there was a very big difference of view. This difference of view, I think, will be seen in future years as having been of tremendous historical importance. What happened was that the Chinese economy opened up. But it was done under the control of the party. It was an interesting experiment because he was able to open up the economy to more and more market forces-to more and more capitalist control, if you like-and he was able to allow more and more Chinese people to participate in that process, to become rich, and he was able to increase the standards of living of the majority. But, in this process of increasingly participating in the market, there was no attempt at all to give any leeway to political democracy. On the contrary, what happened was that there was a situation in which he felt that the only way in which he could manage the transition from the central economy to the market economy was by very tough political control. A lot of us disagreed with that. I was one of those who disagreed with that. In the Soviet system there was a dramatic change in the political area with a very fast democratisation, there was total confusion in the economic transition and there was a lot more economic pain than there was in China. That is a very interesting phenomenon when we try to judge these things from a Western point of view. We have to keep in mind the actual consequences on people. In retrospect, I would like to say that, if I had to choose between the Gorbachev model and the Deng Xiaoping model, I would prefer the Deng Xiaoping model, with this exception",86
156,Mr FILING,CONDOLENCES,Are you in favour of what happened in Tiananmen Square?,87
157,Dr THEOPHANOUS,CONDOLENCES,"No, I am not in favour of Tiananmen Square. I would prefer the Deng Xiaoping model with this exception: I believe that what Deng Xiaoping could not see was that after the economic reforms were put in placeMr FiIing-That is not what you told the students.",87
158,Dr THEOPHANOUS,CONDOLENCES,"You will get your opportunity to say whatever you want. This is a condolence motion. Just be quiet. The situation was that the Chinese people had the economic reforms put in place and then they had what was supposed to be the next stage, which was the political and democratisation stage. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, that stage did not proceed in the way in which it was originally anticipated. I was in China in 1986, and that was the first time. I had been there. At that time there was a very exciting debate going on within the Deng Xiaoping government about what to do about the next stage of political liberalisation. In fact, there was a great deal of optimism that after the economic reforms would come, as a matter of course, the democratic reforms and the political liberalisation. You can imagine how disappointed and upset we all were when that did not happen and when the opposite happened with the tragic events of Tiananmen Square in 1989. I think the whole world was shocked at that point. They thought there would be economic liberalisation followed by political liberalisation, but that did not occur. I was shocked, very disappointed and upset by that, as were all my colleagues and the majority of members in this parliament. We believed that something would happen in China in terms of democracy. But what we have seen is this strange legacy from Deng Xiaoping. On the one hand, we had the economic reforms which are continuing apace. On the other hand, we had the crushing of the democracy movement. The member for Lalor said that he believes Deng Xiaoping was centrally responsible for that, and I think you have to say that is true. However, we will never know whether it was intended that there be a further phase of greater democratic liberalisation or not, because Deng Xiaoping has been so ill for so many years that others have been in control of the agenda. The original intention of having economic reform followed by political reform was not a bad strategy. What was wrong with it was the crushing of the democratic revolution in China. I have heard that President Jiang Zemin hopes to increase the pace of reform. I hope that will include political reform. I hope it will not be just an attempt to continue with the market economic reforms without political reform, without greater human rights and without the ability of political parties to be formed in China to participate in the genuine democratic process. I think Australia has an enormous interest in all these events, but there is no doubt that the role of Deng Xiaoping has been significant-both positively and negatively. He will be remembered for his enormous contribution to the modernisation of China; a modernisation with which we all agree. Let us hope that his successors will now take on the very big challenge-which, as I say, I believe was part of the original intention-to move the nation towards much greater democracy and much greater respect for human rights. Then we can build on the economic progress that China has made with the development of a modem democratic nation. In that spirit, I think we will all respect the grieving of the Chinese people for Deng Xiaoping; we will think about his contribution and the possibility that what he began can be continued with a more democratic China.",87
159,Mr FILING,CONDOLENCES,"It was an interesting presentation from the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) that he prefers the Deng model to the Gorbachev model. I am sure that is of great consolation to the many Chinese still stuck in slave factories or in brutal prisons or to the families of those who have been executed or those in Beijing who were rounded up and liquidated-which is the euphemism they use in communist countries-because they happened to be handicapped and were going to be a blasted nuisance if Beijing won the right to stage the Olympics in its city. That is the sort of scenario in which we talk today about our subject, Deng Xiaoping. In speaking to this motion, I am dissenting from the motion before the House moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and spoken to by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). Mr Bevis-Anything for a headline, Paul.",87
160,Mr FILING,CONDOLENCES,"I might add that I would be very reluctant indeed to speak to a motion of condolence to Adolf Hitler or Pol Pot. What I am trying to say is that the others have focused on the reality of Deng Xiaoping: the man, his achievements, his legacy to China and how he has influenced that region. I was interested to watch former Prime Minister Bob Hawke deliver accolades to Deng on a television news program-no tears, no recollection of promises to Chinese students that they could stay in Australia rather than go home in the wake of the Tiananmen massacre to face certain human rights abuses. It looks as though death allows almost anyone to be forgi ven their transgressions. Deng Xiaoping was the man most responsible for the economic reformation in China and for opening it to the West. To think this was because of his enlightenment and moderate nature is the height of naivety. The fact that China has embarked on a modernisation program under Deng has been widely misinterpreted. The seductively large market and opportunity for investment in China has had a range of Western nations, including Australia, jockeying for opportunity and advantage. This competition has been aggressive enough and the potential prizes large enough for a number of nations to turn a blind eye to China's human rights record at a time when they maintain blockades on nations like Burma or Cuba. Deng's motivation was not to develop a healthy democratic and capitalist state in China. His policy was one of survival for the communist regime. The Chinese leaders have a deep sense of history. At the tum of the century, China was a weak, divided absolute monarchy which was being dictated to by the Western powers which forced markets open with gunboat diplomacy. The Soviet Union's inability to modernise its economy and compete with the West ultimately led to its collapse, and the member for Calwell mentioned that. These lessons were not lost on Deng. With every opening of a market, there can be no doubt that measures were taken by the party to maintain its grip on Chinese society. Opening up markets had two main objectives. Firstly, it modernised China's economy, strengthening its gradual move to a position as an economic and, in consequence, political giant. Secondly, it linked China's prosperity to the prosperity of key Western nations, limiting the level of opposition to the method used to maintain the regime's grip on power. I find it amazing that China has managed to retain the coveted holy grail of most favoured nation status with the United States in recent years. Human rights abuse-and I know that the member for Calwell on many occasions in this place has been a strong advocate for human rights-remains endemic in China. It is enshrined in the legislative system and political philosophy of the Chinese Communist Party. This has increased in sophistication and reach under Deng Xiaoping. According to the American based Asia Watch and to Amnesty-and I note that there are two members of Amnesty presently sitting at the table-China still maintains a system of slave labour camps, religious persecution, murder, disappearances and summary executions. The new United States Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, has recently had some harsh things to say about Burma, Cuba and Iraq as nations who have adopted a philosophy that freedom leads to instability, which leads to economic disorganisation and, thus, is a reason for suppressing political freedom. But she stops short of any criticism of China's human rights record; rather, the Americans now criticise China for unfair trade practices. Let us tum to Tibet. Religious persecution in Tibet has been a stereotype of how to destroy a culture and subjugate absolutely an entire ethnic minority. Over the years priests have been tortured and murdered, nuns raped and leaders kidnapped or exiled. Religious centres have been the sites of desecration and unprovoked massacres. The final solution for Tibet is a massive transplanting of Han Chinese into Tibet, with a view to swamping the ethnic Tibetan society and ending debate over ownership of the nation once and for all. Interestingly enough-and the member for Calwell might be interested in this-no trade liberalisation initiatives for Tibet seem to have been part of Deng's master plan. Let us look at western China. The situation for Tibet could easily be repeated now in western China. Muslim communities will now be faced with systematic destruction of their culture and society along the lines that we have witnessed in Tibet. Those in power will be sorely tempted to follow the policies of repression so ruthlessly utilised by Deng Xiaoping. Then there is the Tiananmen Square massacre. In June 1989 Deng Xiaoping exercised personal authority to brutally suppress calls for a share of political freedom to complement the growth in what was seen as economic freedom. The results were a stark and dramatic statement that the power of the party was absolute, that any economic loosening of the reins would not flow on in political freedoms and that human rights in China under Deng were as expendable as the lives of thousands of people who were killed or persecuted. I would hope that we here do not forget Deng's personal hand in the Tiananmen Square massacre. Let me tum to the one-child policy. The one-child policy has been maintained under Deng Xiaoping as an absolute ruthless attack on the indefensible-unborn children. He has encouraged continuation of the policy as a means of halting China's population growth. What this has meant, though, is that many hundreds of thousands of abortions are carried out as a state policy of population control and at any time from conception to full term. This, of course, is one of the great sore points that is being felt in western China amongst the Muslim communities in the region. I am sure that, if similar sorts of methods were used in Australia amongst Australian women, we in here would be the first to maintain an absolutely huge outcry-yet here we are prepared to move a condolence motion to the architect of this policy. Reports have even emerged of new born children being subjected to lethal injections and medical experiments in the implementation of Deng's policy. This is not the work of a champion of liberalisation. This is the work of a tyrant, an absolute tyrant, a murderer and a suppressor of democracy. People who make mealymouthed comments about how he has managed to open up China, thus enabling more open trade, are letting down the very people whose human rights desperately need the support of neighbours in this area. Mr Bevis-The Prime Minister said that, Paul.",88
161,Mr FILING,CONDOLENCES,"-The member at the table is quite correct. I am just as critical of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) as well as the Leader of the Opposition. Let me tum now to Pol Pot. It is well recognised that in modem times one of the greatest tyrants responsible for human tragedy on a massive scale has been Pol Pot. How could the leader of a Communist insurgent band have achieved so much destruction in such little time? Pol Pot drew his support exclusively from China in his long struggle to power. The leadership there promoted his cause, helped train and educate his followers and supplied him with the means to maintain his struggle and then his regime against all international opposition. Deng Xiaoping's contribution in the massacre of over a million Cambodians through his unswerving support of Pol Pot should neither be forgotten nor forgiven by the international community just because he has passed on. I turn to the Taiwan missile crisis. China's approach in the region whilst Deng was leader was not always tinged with subtlety. Its recent test firing of missiles and naval manoeuvres were designed to intimidate Taiwan during its national elections. This was a barefaced attempt to bludgeon the people in Taiwan into accepting China's role as ruler-in-waiting. Naval intervention by the United States may have been the only reason for restraint by Deng's regime. This is not the action of a regime headed by a man to be commended as a consummate negotiator who has led his nation towards openness. Equally, you will not find much depth to the sympathy expressed by leaders of our nearest neighbours. China's heavy-handed approach to the disputed zones in the South China Sea has been a source of great anxiety in our region. A refusal to negotiate, when brute force was quicker and more final, has been the most noticeable characteristic of the Chinese approach under Deng. The most important thing that we can do now that Deng Xiaoping is dead is to strive more strongly for the political freedom of people living in China. As a younger breed of Chinese leaders come onto the world stage, we can expect that they will be no less hard line, but perhaps they will have had different experiences to those who participated in the Long March. Deng Xiaoping was responsible, directly and indirectly, for the perpetuation of a system of intolerable repression that has affected and, in many cases, killed many millions of people. His passing should not be seen as a sad moment in China's history. He was no Gorbachev who has seen that there is a better way for the people of his nation. We can only be thankful that this chapter in China's history is now partly over and hope that life in the future is better for the Chinese people than it has been under Deng Xiaoping.",89

163,Mr KERR,CONDOLENCES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Tony Smith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I understand that the call should go alternately. The opposition had the call previously through the member for Calwell, then the member for MooreMr Barry Jones-And me. Mr Tony Smith-Yes, and the member for Lalor, as he points out.",90
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I have already called the honourable member for Denison. He was the one who caught my eye. Your name is not on the speakers list. But, if you intend to speak, I will give you the next call.",90
165,Mr KERR,CONDOLENCES,"Inevitably on an occasion when this parliament looks to review the life of somebody of the nature of Deng, we will discover both the good and the evil that resides in great social change and upheaval. Deng's life actually, I think, can be seen not as that of a person who simply comes forward at a time of some tranquillity and makes choices, but rather as that of a person who found himself at a very young age engaged in the overthrow of a social order which had been deeply and long established. He was committed. to an ideology which was designed really out of utopianism-a belief that, through collective action and the operation of a group of people coming together, they could actually transform a feudal society into a communist state which would transcend poverty and share the benefits of the land with all those who lived in it. But these were not pacifists, as the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has said. These were violent revolutionaries who, firstly, contested the forces of Chiang Kai-shek and, secondly, the Japanese. They consolidated their first tenuous power in small regions of China. Then they were defeated and sent on the Long March, in which Deng was a participant. They were brought down by attrition to a few thousand. They later controlled a small area in the north-west of China and later expanded from that base to be the leaders of the most populous nation on earth. In that process, Deng was as ruthless and as violent as any of those who took part. But this was not a time in which pacifism was much rewarded. It was a time in which the Japanese invasion of China occurred, with the massacre of many, perhaps millions, of Chinese. It was a time in which the nationalist government executed and purged society of anyone holding views other than its own, and killed many thousands. The Shanghai massacres of communists occurred under the nationalist governof ment. These were violent and utopian times when people were forced into positions which many of us look back on and say were quite extreme and extraordinary. Of course, these events were not occurring in China alone. The great revolution was occurring in the Soviet Union, and the European theatre was engulfed and transformed by the rise of Nazism and the bloody horrors that occurred as a result of rise of Fascism in Europe and in Japan. To get some appreciation of the man and the times, I think you have to start from a point a little earlier than saying, 'Deng opened up China to market forces.' Deng played a significant role in what was believed by those who were revolutionaries to be a remarkable transforming event. He himself was a victim of it. He was purged as part of the Cultural Revolution. There were many people-not least in our own society in Australia-who felt optimistic and enthusiastic about the prospects of Chinese renewal with the Cultural Revolution. But we know now that it was again a period of great hunger and despair, murder and unrest in China. Deng, of course, was a victim of that. His own personal survival was at stake when he and Liu Shaoqi were branded as numbers one and two persons taking the capitalist road. He survived that period with self-criticism. He described himself as an 'unreformed, petty bourgeois intellectual accustomed to lording it over others and becoming something special.' He said, 'What I need to do is reflect on my past actions. I have gone astray on the road of politics. With the radiance of Mao Zedong's thought lighting my forward path, I should have the fortitude to pick myself up and go on.' There was a man who was actually confronted by the forces of totalitarianism. had to bend to those forces, and yet he was able, when he himself came back into favour, to find some flexibility in his own mind. This is an interesting social circumstance. Whatever we say of him, he has left China a united country, one where hunger has been largely removed. But at the same time many of us would say it is a society which lacks the sorts of cultural norms that we, as members Amnesty International and people committed to democratic processes, expect and desire; its cultural norms are still far from what we would wish to emulate. I understand other speakers wish to make some comments before the dinner break. I will try to give them an opportunity.  to associate myself with the motion of condolence. As other speakers have noted, Deng the was purged three times and ultimately returned to power. He is the last of the Long March heroes. But, as others who have already spoken have noted, Tiananmen Square will always be etched on our minds. I think it will always sully the reputation of Paramount Leader Deng. However, I think he showed great initiative, firstly in opening up agriculture, particularly after the Great Leap Forward and, secondly, in his efforts to open up the Chinese economy. Like other speakers, I sincerely hope that we will see progress not only on the economic front but, more importantly, on human rights. Democratisation and human rights, I believe, pose no threat to China but, in fact, will ensure its longevity and continued history and contribution to the world. I would have liked to have said some more, but I will conclude my remarks at that point. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.",90

170,Mr QUICK,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"I will continue the remarks I was making about 11 days ago. I was talking about the dissenting report by Professor Ergas, a telecommunications economist. One wonders why the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) has taken to heart the concerns of one telecommunications economist over the nine people with a more, I think, genuine understanding of the industry and needs of the Australian consumer. As an legislation interested bystander, I looked for a possible reason. I happened to come across an article entidemand tled 'Telecommunications law: Australian perspectives' published by Media Arm Pty Ltd in 1990. In this document one Richard Alston has an article published entitled 'Time for some real competition: is Telecom's universal service obligation still relevant?' believe that this very large article was part the minister's thesis when he was at universiservices ty and, believe it or not, the lecturer at time was one Henry Ergas. The gentleman services even features twice in the minister's thesis. It is interesting to see what the minister had to say in his dissertation on whether Telecom's universal service obligation is relevant. On page 373 he states: Whilst this might once have been a laudable and indeed necessary objective when the household penetration rate was 53 per cent in 1970, now that 94 per cent of Australian households have telephones its continued justification must be questioned; especially when households account for over 70 per cent of main lines although providing only 45 per cent of revenue. On page 380 he states: By the 1970s, 'universal service' had been practically achieved and new priorities for the telephone system began to emerge. On page 381 he states: A basic 'lifeline' or no frills type of service should guarantee the end user the ability to access emergency numbers and to receive incoming calls. Communications with police, fire and medical personnel are essential in this modern world. Perhaps the answer is a low fixed monthly charge with a high per minute message rate on local calls. On page 399 of his dissertation, he states: To many of those who use the term, 'universal service' simply means 'the more, the better'. But with household penetration rates around 94 per cent there is good reason to conclude that universal service has now been achieved. Whilst there may be some households which are not connected to the service for economic reasons it does not follow that financial assistance is necessarily appropriate. Some individuals may be nearly as accessible through a close neighbour's phone, a pay phone down the hall, a phone at work or even the postal service. As I stated earlier in my speech, I am deeply the concerned that this government through this is failing to take into account the rapid convergence of technologies which is currently taking place and the increasing for services such as rapid fax transmissions, e-mail, the Internet, electronic commerce, telemedicine and educational applications. This error, if allowed to go uncorrected, has potentially disastrous consequences for reI gional Australia in particular because the of provision of advanced telecommunications to much of rural and remote Australia the and Tasmania is uneconomic. Unless such are specified as part of the universal service obligation, no carrier will provide them in the foreseeable future. It remains to be seen just how this governstill ment responds to each of the recommendations in the majority report of the Standard Telephone Service Review Group. So far, rural and regional Australians have good reason to believe that the Howard Liberal government will not deliver access to telecommunications services they need unless those services are specifically prescribed the legislation. Accordingly, we on this side of the House will seek to amend this bill in the Senate upgrade the standard telephone service. The proposed amendments will be broadly with the key recommendations of the majority report. Until the bill is amended to ensure airtight guarantee of equity of access for rural and regional Australia, it should be opposed.",93
171,Mr REID,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"I am very pleased to speak in this debate in support of the telecommunications bills, which will govern telecommunications after 1 July 1997. The government's legislative package contains real benefits for people in rural and remote Australia. The government recognises the role telecommunications plays in rural remote Australia, and the legislation is suptelecentre, portive of this role. To ensure that rural and remote areas and the rest of the nation can derive the maximum possible benefit from telecommunications, it is vital that regulatory arrangements foster development of a robust, competitive and efficient industry and ensure that industry meets the expectations of the Australian to community. Already there have been some benefits from the introduction of limited competition in 1991, although, particularly from the perspective of rural communities, they may not have been as great or as widely shared as some may have hoped. The task for the future is to build on gains that have been made and to ensure even greater benefits occur in the future. The electorate that I represent is well placed benefit from the expansion of the telecomUp munications area, and this has already occurinstallation, red in a number of different ways. Since the movement to the adoption of a more open market for telecommunications, area. there have been a number of private providers offering a whole range of telecommunications services-private firms have taken the initiaFor tive and set up businesses; some of them well have been Telstra employees in the past-such as telephones, faxes, et cetera, and providing an excellent service. All of those the firms are growing and employing quite a number of people in this very expanding field. in With the introduction of further competition from I July 1997, with the advent of further involvement from Optus and Vodafone, there to is likely to be an even greater expansion of telecommunications services throughout rural in line and remote areas of Australia. There has also been quite a strong developan ment of Internet providers through the Bendigo electorate. They are doing an excellent job in providing access to that service for many telephone subscribers, and many people are becoming involved in the Internet and the World Wide Web. Also, the infrastructure that is currently in place with Telstra in the Bendigo region lends the opportunity to provide more telecentres for a whole range of public key and private sector operations. Already the and prominent Bendigo Bank, which operates a which is very vigorous in that area, is providing an excellent service to its new and intending customers. The government's three-pronged strategy of partially privatising Telstra, introducing open the competition and enhancing consumer safeguards will mean that greater benefits will occur in the future. Open competition is likely serve rural and remote areas better than the limited competition we have had to date. Under the open regime, specialised or regional service providers will be able to enter small markets and target the needs of rural and remote users. This is already happening in one area of my electorate-a place called the Heathcote. Because of the threat of future that competition, Telstra have now agreed to install a mobile phone tower in that area and to to improve the mobile phone communications. until recently, they were resisting that but it just shows what a little bit of competition can do. They are now going to provide an improved service to that Heathcote There are some things under the open regime that will help rural and remote users. example, licensing requirements and costs may are minimal. There are few restrictions on technology. At the same time, while protecting the community's interests, community service obligations are not onerous and are consistent with those applying to telecommunications companies in other advanced economies. Such operations will be facilitated by the proposed access regime, which will provide interconnection and access on fair and reasonable terms. There will be no barriers to satellite operators, including the proposed low earth orbiting satellite operators, offering service in rural and remote areas. The government's regional telecommunications infrastructure fund, which was recently announced, will be used to encourage the use of telecommunications services and the development of communications facilities in regional areas. I want to highlight some of the things that need to be done in an area such as Bendigo, and I am sure that other areas in Victoria, such as Ballarat, would be similar. There is still a need for the upgrading of some of the small rural exchanges, there is a need for further optic cable to be put in the ground, and there is a need for consumers in the area to have access to all of the latest services that are available to them. At the moment, a lot of the small rural exchanges are unable to provide even an itemised billing account. If you wish to operate a business in a small rural community, you have all of the other facilities at your disposal but, if you do not have the telecommunications network and you do not have an itemised billing account, it is very difficult run a business under those circumstances. I welcome the government's commitment to the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund. I understand that fund will bring substantial benefits to rural areas, and I look forward to addressing some of the disadvantages that rural and regional telecommunications users face compared with their metropolitan counterparts in terms of access to, and cost of, the advanced communications that are available worldwide. We would hope that all of those best international practices would be available throughout Australia in a very short time. The initiative is in response to the disadvanwritten tage that rural telecommunications users face in their access to telecommunications services such as high speed data communications, the Internet and their ability to utilise mobile communications. The ultimate goal for the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund is to improve the quality of communications and information services available to rural people in their social and commercial activities for training and education and, as a result, enhance employment and development opportunities in rural areas. Telstra and the government obviously have an ongoing interest in the development of improved telecommunication services. Since the new government has come into office, Telstra has been cooperative in looking at some of the services in rural and remote areas of Australia. But there is still a long way to go and the infrastructure needs to be further developed. Under its future mode of operation program, Telstra will be fully digitalising its interexchange trunk network. Effective completion of this program will occur by December 1998. Under its remote Australia telecommunications enhancement program, Telstra is looking at providing high capacity network access for remote customers using high and very high capacity radio concentrator systems. Optus is also spending tens of millions of dollars upgrading its satellite system to digital technology, improving access to pay television and high speed data services for nonto metropolitan Australians. The difficult part in telecommunications is to anticipate how a lot of the services will be provided in the future. For many providers, this must be a real unknown quantity because it is difficult to know whether they will be receiving their telephone communication services via a cable, via a satellite, via the existing structure or by some new technology which is currently being developed. Cable is now being introduced to a number of areas and telephone communication services are being offered via the cable transmission as well. The Internet is thriving and people are hooking into it and exchangit;lg on-screen messages. It probably Will not be too long before we see voice transmission as well through some means of additional technology. The government is not prepared to rely wholly on competition to ensure that the community's expectations are met in relation to telecommunications. The government will be continuing with its enhancements and will be expanding the wide range of existing consumer safeguards to make sure that people are looked after. The consumer must be looked after, particularly those living in rural and remote areas who rely on their telecommunications system. I want to highlight a couple of other things-firstly, the universal service obligation. The government is fully committed to the concept of universal service in telecommunications under which the standard telephone service and payphone and, after 1997, other prescribed services are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia wherever they reside or carryon business. The universal service arrangements will ensure that all people, regardless of whether they live in urban, rural or remote areas, have access at a minimum cost to a standard package of telecommunications services. The price at which such services are supplied can be regulated by price control under the Telstra Corporation Act or under the Telecommunications Bill 1996. The government illustrated this commitment in the reaffirmation of the universal service obligation in the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Act and in the enhancements it has made to the universal service arrangements under the Telecommunications Bill 1996. The universal service regime ensures that services that might otherwise be loss making and uncommercial are provided by ensuring the universal service provider is compensated for any such losses by the industry as a whole. These costs are significant, totalling $246 million in 1995-96. There are many things that I would like to continue speaking about on this particular matter, but I recognise that there are many people on the government side of the House who wish to speak in support of this legislation. I simply add my support to the legislation, and I know that I have many colleagues supporting me in my representations.",94
172,Ms WORTH,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"The Telecommunications Bill 1996 and cognate bills are a fulfilment of the coalition's telecommunications commitments made at the last election. They represent a genuine effort to undo the mess left behind by the previous Labor government, and indicate the clear visions of this government for the telecommunications industry into the next century. I will specifically address the overhead cable debacle, which is of great concern to my constituents in Adelaide, but, first, I would like to talk about the many positive aspects of this bill. First and foremost, this bill will produce a higher level of telecommunications services to consumers through greater competition and tougher industry codes. The bill also reinforces the protection and confidentiality of information, boosts the powers of the industry watchdogs, such as the Australian Telecommunications Authority, Austel, and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. These reforms signal a legitimate attempt on behalf of the government to tackle the difficult task of keeping up with the fast pace set by advances in technology and consumer demand in the telecommunications sector. Apart from boosting traditional phone services and modernising mobile phone services, this bill will also improve consumer access to new information technologies and financial services. The bill also requires that better planning strategies between carriers, such as the sharing of infrastructure, be implemented. Members will remember Labor's scare campaign in the lead-up to the last election which saw materials circulating stating that a coalition government would increase the cost of local calls and that some communities would not receive the same standard of service as others. We see today with this legislation, however, that this government is actually improving services to all consumers and creating a competitive environment conducive to lower consumer costs in the future. This government's refonns will continue price controls under the Telstra Corporation Act and the ceiling of 25c on local calls will remain. The customer service guarantee is also an entirely new consumer safeguard designed to promote higher levels of service and provide a streamlined means of compensation where these levels are not achieved. It is the issue of the telecommunications code as it relates to overhead cables and mobile phone towers which remains the critical concern for the people of Adelaide. I first became involved in this debate within a year of being elected. On 26 July 1994, I contacted the then Minister for Communications and the Arts, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), expressing my deep concern about the way the telecommunications carriers were ignoring the concerns of local communities. When the minister finally responded nine months later, he stated that the existing code was an 'appropriate balance' between the 'need to facilitate carrier network roll-out' and 'the protection of Australia's national environment'. I personally, and many of my constituents, have since seen how unbalanced that code was. Legislation before the House today will strengthen the code. Labor's inability to do so first created the situation whereby overhead cables would become a feature of the urban landscape to add to the ugliness already created by stobie poles and electricity cables. In the following months, I placed two questions on notice to the Labor minister asking what steps the government was taking to strengthen the code, arranged community meetings in Adelaide with the then shadow communications minister, Senator Alston, and made speeches in the parliament. Late in 1995, in this House I said: My constituents want to know what the minister is going to do to protect their rights which have been totally eroded by the government's decision to exempt telecommunications carriers from state and local government planning laws. They are still waiting for answers. Such is the failure of this government to respond to the legitimate community concerns. Under the existing code, the role given to local councils in this process is little more than In my electorate, local councils . . . have found themselves ignored by the carriers. The existing code which regulates the behaviour of the carriers involved in the roll-out of telecommunications networks is simply not adequate. A new and tighter code with more power for local councils is needed. My constituents are ... merely asking that their interest be taken into account . . . In early December 1995, I wrote a submission to the review of the national code. Amongst other comments, I expressed concern about the visual pollution of overhead cables. Since the election of the coalition to government in March 1996, I and members of my staff have continued to attend community and local government meetings to discuss possible solutions to overhead cables. Simultaneously, I have been in continued contact with Minister Alston over community concerns. In October last year, I arranged a meeting between the minister and the mayors of Prospect and Unley councils. While my constituents and all local governments in my electorate have been concerned about the environmental impact of the rollout, they have been willing to work with the carriers for better outcomes. But this attitude has not always been reciprocated by Optus and Telstra. In at least one instance, the local council in question was told about the preparation work for the roll-out of the cables on the same day that the contractors appeared in the local streets and commenced work. This situation has resulted from the previous Labor government's decision to permit the installation of overhead cables with only minimal requirements for the carriers to consult with local councils and the local community. This coalition government has found itself in the position of having to clean up the mess of overhead cabling. The new code will ensure that carriers have to consult and work closely with local councils and communities. From 1 July, broadband overhead cables will not be rolled out without the planning approval of the state and local councils. Other measures in the new telecommunicatokenism. tions national code which will come into effect on 1 July include: one, carriers must collocate their facilities wherever possible; two, councils and other relevant authorities must be notified of proposals to install facilities; three, councils may make alternative proposals and may require carriers, at their expense, to publicly notify details of the proposal and to consult with the community in cases where proposals have a high environmental or heritage impact; four, carriers cannot install aerial cabling unless there is already aerial cabling in the immediate area; five, carriers must place cabling underground where power authorities and other carriers have done so; six, overhead cables will now have to be a minimum height, with safety precautions taken into account; seven, the new telecommunications national code will require the undergrounding of cables at intersections; eight, where overhead cables are installed, they must now be grey and not black; nine, visual amenity impact of any description will also be a mandatory primary consideration in the carrier's decision making process and must be addressed by the carrier on a street by street basis; 10, individual streets may be undergrounded where residents request it and agree to pay incremental costs with arrangements to be made through local councils. Subscriber drops will be undergrounded where the subscriber agrees to pay the incremental cost or where the incremental cost is borne by the subscriber's local council. Austel will now have the power to audit the carriers for compliance and there will be fines of up to $10 million for breaches of the code. I do not think that it is any secret that new tougher measures have resulted from considerable backbench pressure being applied to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, including my own ongoing representations to the minister on behalf of the people of Adelaide. This is a far better result than consumers could have expected under Labor and it is a good example of the effect local members can have on policy and the benefits of working within the government. The actions of the previous Labor government, including the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) when he was communications minister in 1991, have however tied the hands of the current government on existing overhead cable. I might add that, in opposition, the coalition parties attempted to disallow the current code in 1994 because it was not strict enough and because it was obvious it would lead to the type of community concern for the urban environment which has since unfolded. At the time we could not gain the support from the Democrats in the Senate. Of specific concern to the people of Adelaide has been the extension, by three months, for carriers to complete their overhead roll-out after the 1 July deadline. This transition period is longer than I and many other people in Adelaide would have liked. However, the transition period for all other measures contained in this bill apart from the cable roll-out is six months. The government has been given little room to manoeuvre due to the undertakings given, especially to Optus, by the previous Labor government. The legal advice received by the minister is to the effect that if this transition period is not granted the Commonwealth runs the risk of being in breach of undertaking. These changes to the national code seek to strike a balance between the need for greater competition and access to consumer services. However, I believe that the environmental and aesthetic concerns of my constituents in Adelaide over overhead cabling remain justified. Apart from the direct visual impact of the cables, trees planted in the streets are under threat from lopping and from damage to the root system if care is not taken when, these hopefully, putting cables underground. Technology and information advances are important, but so too are local environmental considerations. Underground cabling solves only one problem. Due to the poor planning in the past, ugly stobie poles and electrical cables will remain, whatever the outcome. Our long-term goal as a community should be to place all cables out of site and underground. I hope better planning and cooperation in the future will make this possible. I am pleased that the communications minister has committed the government to a leadership role in these efforts. The establishment of a working group on undergrounding made up of representatives from all levels of government, industry groups and interest groups will consider moving all utility and communications cables underground. Even if South Australia could say no to overhead cables and do without the technological advances currently enjoyed by eastern seaboard states, we would still have ugly stobie poles. This would be a situation where everybody loses. The horse has already bolted under Labor, but if we can work together as a community towards the undergrounding of all cables and the removal of poles from the urban landscape then everyone benefits. I have received information today from the city of Unley of the initial costing and research of locating all services underground. The cost is estimated to be between $2,500 and $3,500 per household. The council's idea would be that costs should be shared four ways between ETSA, Optus, Telstra and the council. Unley council's research, to be presented to council tonight, shows that when faced with the prospect of a $1,500 to $2,000 cost per ratepayer property, two in every three respondents or 66 per cent agreed that the benefits of undergrounding all cabling would justify such an outlay. Twenty-four per cent disagreed. I would like to thank all concerned residents in Adelaide for their efforts over the last three years to consult and work with me on this issue. I would like to assure them that the new code includes tighter restrictions on the telecommunications carriers and that the government is firmly committed to the future undergrounding of all cables. This cognate telecommunications bill will bring an end to the overly centralised and non-consultative approach of Labor. Improvements in telecommunications services and technology should never again be at the cost of the local environment. I am surprised that the opposition when speaking to this bill came into this House and moved an amendment to try to belatedly look as if they were actually caring about the people in our electorates. That was just one more stunt as far as I am concerned. It would have been far more appropriate if they had come in and said that they were wrong, that they were wrong in some initial decisions they took, and they offered an apology. But they did not do that. We are doing the best we can to sort out the mess. I commend the bill to the House.",96
173,Mrs GALLUS,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,I am somewhat surprised to be here so early. I believe the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was about to speak on this matter. Mr Warwick Smith-He gave way to you.,99
174,Mrs GALLUS,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"I am very grateful to the Leader of the Opposition for giving way but I am somewhat hurried in my preparation because of that. There have been some good contributions in this debate on the telecommunications bills on both sides of the House and, I might say, some very silly contributions from the opposition which remind one of the shrill bark and ankle biting nuisance of dyspeptic small dogs. And well they might sound shrill and ill-tempered, because it was the Labor Party's legislation that created the problem that now is the Optus cable roll-out. It was the 1991 legislation, which this 1996 legislation replaces, which has placed Australia at risk of being one of the ugliest urban environments in the world. I say that advisedly. If you have a look at the sight of these cables-the wire that they hang from, the cable itself, the connection to all the housesit is extraordinarily ugly. It is no wonder the local councils have been up in arms trying to protect their areas from this visual scourge that has hit our cities and local residents. I think it is a reflection on this parliament and on politicians generally that we have allowed a situation where residents feel they no longer have any power in this country. This is what they are saying to me. An elderly resident of mine, Lorraine Woodcock, as she defied Optus cables and moved her chair and her umbrella under the roll-out, said, 'I do not want this in front of my house. My neighbours do not want this in front of their houses. Why do we no longer have a voice in what is so sacred to us, which is our visual landscape, our street scapes?' They feel impotent, and that impotence results directly from the legislation enacted in this House by the now opposition, the then Labor government. What that Labor government did was give Optus carte blanche to overrule all state and local government laws and by-laws. I do not know the reason they did this. I suspect they were ill advised and never realised exactly what was going to be the outcome of what they did. The result of that roll-out has been the visual pollution which this bill today attempts in some areas to correct. Of course it is not possible to fully correct what has happened. Those cables are out there. They are in front of houses in my electorate. They are in front of houses in other electorates and the people do not like it and they feel that they have been betrayed. There is another aspect to that: the effect on Australia's reputation as a tourist destination. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker: as a tourist, where would you like to go to? An urban landscape? Perhaps I could direct that question to the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), who is at the table and who was a member of the Labor government. I ask him how the tourists feel when they come to Victoria? Instead of seeing attractive cities in which the streets are good to travel down, they see this urban blight of wires and cables. It is not just the cables. The cables add to that already existing eyesore of the overhead powerlines. I do not know what they are like in the electorate of Corio, but in the electorate of Hindmarsh the powerlines are extraordinarily ugly and are made even uglier by the addition of these cables. In allowing this, the Labor government hit Australia at its heart, which is its tourism industry. It created an urban ugliness which tourists to this country will tum away from. I would like to compare this with the city of Paris. I believe Paris is the most beautiful city in the world. It is a city that attracts tourists from all over the world. No doubt, that is partly because of its historical basis and because of its beautiful old buildings. But part of it is also that it is a very beautiful One of the reasons it remains a beautiful city is that it has no overhead wiring whatsoever. The city of Paris is free from that overhead wiring, which is something the member for Corio might have noticed when he was last there on one of his many parliamentary delegations. Australia cannot have that now. It is not only overhead wiring: the previous speaker, the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), referred to stobie poles. I think these are peculiar to South Australia and may not be present in other states. Stobie poles, for those who do not have them in their electorates, are cement poles between which the wires are put and between which the Optus cables will be rolled out. These are extraordinarily ugly constructions. Not only are they ugly; they are very dangerous because if a car hits them it is very difficult to save the occupants from such a hard impact. The previous speaker also mentioned trees. Once you have these cables and wires, the trees cannot grow to their full size. They are stunted, creating another form of visual pollution affecting our neighbourhoods. I have mentioned two things: the visual pollution and the effect on tourism. I would also like to consider the effect on the health of residents. If members in this place would like to think about what they feel when they come out of their own homes, if they see a good view and a good streetscape it starts them off feeling good for the day. The uglier the environment, the worse the effects on health. This is a legacy of the 1991 legislation of the then Labor government, which this bill now seeks to do what it can to redress. It is no secret that I would have liked the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to end the roll-out on 30 June .. I fought for that. I understand the constraints the minister was under. There was a fear that if the cut-off came at that point the Commonwealth would be subject to commercial litigation because it would in effect take the ending period back to March. A period had to be allowed for the finishing off of the construction that had already started. It was for this reason and no other that this government allowed a finishing off period of city. three months. No new construction was to start in that time, but Optus was allowed to finish what it started. Under the threat of litigation, the Commonwealth provided this three months, much to the distress of those on the backbench who fought very hard against the Labor legislation but accepted the reasons the minister gave for the three months for completion. Also covered by this package of legislation before us today is the issue of mobile phone towers. Mobile phone towers are a growing problem in all of our electorates. I would like to refer to one in particular in my electorate, although I do have more than one going up which is opposed by residents. This is a mobile phone tower in Fulham Gardens. It is on top of an ETSA power station. At present, as I speak, residents in the area are picketing that power station to stop the erection of the mobile phone tower which will cater for Optus, Vodafone and Telstra and will be, I believe, 33 metres tall. This tower is 18 metres from a house with children. If we can go back for a moment and look at the visual impact of these towers, I do not think there is a member in this House who would want to have a tower next door to his or her house for the reason that you do not want to see a mobile phone tower 33 metres up outside your window when you get up in the morning. More than that, it devalues the property you are in. House buyers are much less likely to buy a house near a mobile phone tower and certainly will not pay the price they would have before that tower was erected. I go back to the Fulham tower and in doing so acknowledge the work that has been done by Gladys Spurling and Kate Barrett in this area. I mentioned that there was a family living in a house 18 metres from this proposed tower that is going up under the legislation the Labor Party provided. This family has small children and is concerned about possible health effects on their children. We do not know whether mobile phone towers do in fact affect children but, as a doctor I know said, 'For heaven's sake, we don't know anywhere near 100th of the types of things that affect the developing brains of children and we should err on the side of caution.' I must agree with that. It may be that in the final analysis we will find that the electromagnetic radiation from these towers is perfectly safe and harmless. I hope and pray sincerely that that is so. But the meantime the people whose houses are near these towers are suffering because they are worrying about the health of their children. Whether or not it turns out to be a reality, they are concerned, and their concern is increased the more information comes out. I refer particularly to an article on a study done by Dr Hocking called 'Cancer and TV Towers'. My constituents acknowledge that TV tower electromagnetic radiation is not the same as mobile phone radiation, but they do see a connection between the two. Dr Hocking's article is very clear. I will read from the abstract of the article. Its objective, which was very clear from the study, was as follows: To detennine whether there is an increased cancer incidence and mortality in population exposed to radio frequency radiation from TV towers. That was the question. The conclusion was: We found an association between increased childhood leukemia incidence and mortality and proximity to TV towers. So how do Labor members think that makes my family-my family in the sense that they are in my electorate-with two small children feel? Their house is located next to what will be a triple tower that was placed there under the current legislation. Fortunately, the minister, unable to totally change the legislation, has made some alteration within his powers to do so inasmuch as the carriers will now have to consider at least two options put to them by council. I would hope that the carriers consider those options very carefully and in doing so take into account the fears that parents do hold for their children's health. Unfortunately, until 30 June the carriers do have the powers that the Labor government gave them. On 1 July that will change and the mobile phone towers will be subject to state and local laws and by-laws. In conclusion, I condemn the previous government for what they have done to this country at a number of levels in passing their 1991 telecommunications legislation and not studying it enough to know the ramifications. If there is a liability, it is in that. I believe they do not know what they did when they put that legislation through, and that is simply in lack of due care. They did not examine the ramifications, and that is why we have the situation we now have where we have a great urban ugliness that will be condemned by citizens of this country not only this year, not only next year, but for decades and possibly centuries to come. I commend the new bills, the 1996 telecommunications legislation package, to this House.",99
175,Mr WARWICK SMITH,RADIOCOMMUNICA TIONS,"Bass-Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games) (8,48 p.m.)-There being no other speakers, it falls to me to make some summing-up remarks before proposing that the bills be read a third time. There are 12 bills as part of this telecommunications package. We have been debating it here this evening and also there was a lengthy debate in the last session. Firstly, I would like to thank everyone for their contributions. This is a major piece of legislation and a major commitment of the government to bring it forward. In particular, I would thank those many government members who have clearly identified many of the important reforms which will arise from the passage of this legislation. I will not have time this evening, unfortunately, to canvass all the issues that have been raised but I will do my best to cover some of those points. Some of the contributions by members of the opposition have indeed distorted and misrepresented some of those issues. Rather than focus on the benefits that will flow to Australian business, consumers and local communities from the introduction of the legislation, which effectively creates a more open and competitive telecommunications regime, they have chosen to focus on perceived negatives which on analysis are shown to be baseless. The opposition has proposed a second reading amendment. The former Minister for Communications and the Arts, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), proposed it, and I indicate that we will be opposing those amendments proposed by the opposition. There are a number of reasons behind that decision, but fundamentally, as members would be aware, the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee is reviewing the legislation and it will report on 5 March, and we, of course, will review the recommendations and see what other changes mayor may not be appropriate. Can I pick up some of the remarks from my colleagues, both opposition and government. Firstly, in relation to the transitional arrangements, if there were no transitional period, therewould be a period in which the carrier was unable to proceed with either the preliminary discussion or formal approval of telecommunications structures. In practical terms, given long lead times in the construction of telecommunications network facilities, the carriers would probably have only until the end of April to lodge notifications. The transitional arrangements proposed in the bill will allow for some installations to continue provided that stringent conditions are met. I think the previous speaker, Mrs Gallus, made it quite clear what some of those conditions are. The government believes that the proposed transitional provisions meet the best interests of the community by allowing the delivery of services subject to strict tests, and that is outlined in more detail in the legislation. There has been some discussion and some debate in the course of this process on the provisions relating to price discrimination and what we are in fact proposing in the legislation. We allow price differentials, and anticompetitive pricing will attract the attention of the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission, the ACCC. A requirement that a carrier offer a standard local call price across its entire network has the perverse effect of denying consumers the full benefit of the price reductions they would otherwise receive. In markets where there is competition, the new entrant has only to offer a price slightly below the incumbent, knowing that it will not trigger a competitive response. Remember that this legislation is all about creating a competitive environment. Consumers will be deprived of the full benefits of competition in such circumstances. New entrants, rather than charging customers at the lowest possible rate, will instead obtain a windfall gain because their competitors are hamstrung. This is not competition and it is not good public policy. We are committed, however, to retaining price caps under this legislation. This, of course, will ensure that there is no increase in the cost of local calls in those areas where there is no competition. This carries forward the price capping that is in the existing legislation. Item (c) in the proposed second reading amendment refers to ISDN connections. Under the Labor Party's future mode of operation program, it was not going to be completed until about 2002. We have delivered on a dramatic acceleration of that timing. The future mode of operations will be effectively completed by 30 December 1998. By December this year the same percentage of metropolitan and non-metropolitan exchanges-85 per cent-will be digitised. Indeed, this was a point that the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) made. You could never imagine the bush getting equal treatment under the former government. So by July 1997, 93.4 per cent of customers will be able to obtain an ISDN connection within 90 days of request. At the time that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced the coalition's policy of providing access to ISDN in the bush, he indicated that there would be a small number of users in remote areas who would not have access to digital services. He committed the government to an investigation of the most appropriate and lowest cost technical options for providing these people with enhanced telephone and digital information services. In this area, too, the government has also met its commitment to the bush. The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) commissioned the review of the standard telephone service, which has reported, and he has also asked the Information Policy Advisory Council to report on rural services. We have made no decision on the standard telephone service report or the minority report it received. We are seeking further information on the costs of the digitisthe ation recommended in the report, consistent with the approach outlined by the Prime Minister last year. We will also closely study the other recommendations of the report. I think it is appropriate to thank those members of the committee for the standard telephone service report, which came out just before Christmas and the extensive submissions that were made. The government is grateful for having received the totality of the work of the committee. In this vein, it is appropriate to consider the importance of the rural telecommunications infrastructure fund, which the minister announced last year. It is a program aimed at enabling rural communities to address their telecommunications concerns and develop solutions appropriate to their circumstances. This is a fund that would never have seen the light of day under the previous government. It is a direct reflection of the government's concern to make sure that rural and remote Australia will get the benefit of upgraded infrastructure to enable it to participate fully in the emerging competitive arrangements that this total package will bring in this industry. The issue of directory assistance has probably passed by, but I also wanted to address it as it is an item in the second reading amendment. The Prime Minister did say in the House that Telstra will not be doing anything in this area that is contrary to pre-election commitments. I think that debate has now passed us by. I wish to refer to some of the opposition's comments. I will not be able to do justice to them, given the constraint on time. The member for Dobell, the former minister, is here taking this through on behalf of the opposition. He did suggest that the delay in the introduction of the package was due to the government scrapping the opposition's former original draft legislation. I think he would be aware now that the draft, in some degrees, failed to address many key elements of the regulatory framework. Industry was aware of this. The government has produced a robust package which is widely recognised by the communications industry as an advance on current legislation and the draft proposals. Indeed, I think the former minister would appreciate that this legislation is complex. Even back in 1991 we were provided with a draft and there were changes from that. This is a process that is going forward. The government took advantage of the draft that you proposed but there were shortcomings and we have tried to address those. We now have a detailed package before this House tonight. A number of opposition speakers made several comments intended to demonstrate that the government was ignoring the needs of rural telecommunications users. I want to direct their attention to the ISDN proposals that I talked about, the standard telephone service report and the telecommunications infrastructure fund. I reiterate that this governconcern ment has met its commitments to the bush and will continue to look at ways of delivering better telecommunications services to rural users. Let me also clear up some confusion enunciated by opposition members regarding the STS report and ISDN. Our response to this report-a report which we are still considering-in no way impacts on our delivery of 93.4 per cent ISDN availability by July 1997 and effective completion of the FMO by December 1998. That is a key matter for the government and we will be pursuing that. I was in the House when the Independent member for Moore (Mr Filing) raised some issues. Perhaps I could deal with those quickly. He raised the possibility of conflict in that Telstra is both an Internet service provider and a carrier providing services to itself and other Internet service providers. We all know that there is a huge growth in Internet connections, so this issue is a matter of legitimate interest and concern. The legislation will give Internet service providers the right to arbitration by the ACCC on the terms and conditions of access to declared services provided by Telstra. The Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Bill, which is a central element of this package, inserts new powers in the Trade Practices Act to deal with anticompetitive conduct by carriers and carriage service providers with substantial market power. The legislation is quite clear in relation to charging data calls on a timed basis. Residential users currently in local call zones will have guaranteed access to untimed local voice and data calls. Businesses in these areas will have guaranteed access to untimed voice calls. While business has not been given the legislated right to untimed data calls, nothing requires carriage service providers to time charge business for these calls and nothing prevents them from charging on an untimed basis if they wish. The member for Moore also raised the issue of whether the universal service obligation will be progressively withdrawn under the new legislation. Indeed, several members mentioned this particular issue and expressed about the universal service obligation. The government is fully committed to the concept of universal service in telecommunications under which the standard telephone service, pay phones and other important services are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia wherever they reside or carry on business. The new legislation considerably strengthens these arrangements. Suggestions that the USO will be progressively withdrawn is fundamentally wrong. The intention of the legislation and the view of the government is clearly the opposite. The Independent member for Cal are (Mr Andren) raised the issue of poor response times in rural areas. The proposed legislation provides a mechanism for dealing with these concerns through the customer service guarantee in part 9 of the Telecommunications Bill. The amendments implementing the CSG in the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill, which I brought before the House some time ago, have been carried over in part 9 of the new Telecommunications Bill. I am glad to say that this was a proposal that first saw its form in the office of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. Finally, I want to commend the contribution of all members who have contributed to the debate. It is unfortunate that I do not have the time to canvass more fully some of the issues, but the speeches did reflect that members recognise the importance of the legislation to the growth of the Australian economy and the positive benefits for business, jobs and consumers in rural and regional Australiaindeed, all of Australia. Many pointed out that this package not only has significant economic benefits but also addresses the problems of the cables. The member for Hindmarsh, Mrs Gallus, who spoke immediately prior to me, talked at some length about these matters. We understand her concern and the concern of her constituents. In our election policy we said that we would take a number of actions to address community concerns while we preserved the community's access to new telecommunications services. We believe we have delivered on those commitments. This legislation contains a major package of reforms relating to carrier network roll-out activities. Under these arrangements broadband cable will not be deployed aerially without the agreement of the relevant authority. There will also be greater control over the erection of mobile phone towers. I do not know if I quite share the alarm that was expressed by the member for Hindmarsh about the impact of mobile phone towers. But, as I understand it, the Minister for Communications and the Arts has this matter under close study. The member for Hindmarsh can be assured that the government will keep the matter under review and will watch the development of scientific papers in that regard. In conclusion, I remind members that the legislation will have significant benefits for Abbott, A. 1. families and businesses throughout Australia and it will assist in reducing household and business costs, which I think would be welcomed by all. It will promote growth and jobs and will deliver a whole new range of telecommunications services to our nation. The process of reform in this industry by this package I believe reaches the high watermark in this very fast moving industry. Local government concerns have been taken account of. Many of the concerns expressed by members on both sides on behalf of local government have been heard. We are moving to do what Labor failed to do when it had the opportunity. We are concerned about the great amenity, the aesthetics, the commitment to localism and also the commitment to good planning. All of these issues are important to Lloyd, J. E. local government, to consumers and to all members. We certainly care and will work through these issues to final solutions. We have sought the widest comment on what is proposed in the legislation and the codes that are attached to it, and the Senate committee may also have some comments about that. We want to have a balance between developing a vibrant, competitive industry, utilise best practice and the latest technology and give effect to all of those local concerns and those aspirations expressed so elegantly by so many of my colleagues. I want to thank them all for their sincere contributions. I therefore have pleasure in commending the bill to the House. I think it puts Australia in a firm position to take advantage of the development of the information age. What this package will do is give us a running start to take advantage of all the opportunities which will emerge, which will be so vital to all of us.

Willis, R. * denotes teller Question so resolved in the affirmative. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Motion (by Mr Warwick Smith) proposed: That the bill be now read a third time. AYES Mr LEE (Dobell) (9.17 p.m.)-The opposition is disappointed that, despite the eloquence of our arguments, we were not able to persuade the majority of the government members to support our second reading amendment. Nevertheless, having listened to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) sum up for the government, he has provoked me into raising a few issues in the third reading debate. I will go through these as quickly as I can. The first issue is that the minister on several occasions claimed that, through this packNOES age, the government has met its commitments to the bush-and he did repeat this line on several occasions. I can understand why a member who represents Launceston might want to argue that in this House. But this minister also has a responsibility to reflect the truth. Let me make it clear that I challenge the claims which the minister has made at the dispatch box tonight because the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, in his speech to the National Farmers Federationand I think it was in November 1995promised that people right around Australia would get ISDN by 1 July 1997. That was the promise that got the National Party in the cart to privatise Telstra; and that was the promise that got the National Farmers Federation in the cart to support the partial privatisation of Telstra. PAIRS We can understand that there were deep tensions in the then opposition about this issue. We had candidates, such as the then well known Joe Hockey, now the honourable member for North Sydney, who believed that any government ownership was an example of the tentacles of socialism gripping our country-and that is still his view . We are going to keep reminding him of this view on many occasions. People such as the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), who want to keep government owned post offices in public hands, will be fighting with the honourable member for North Sydney when he tries to chop off the tentacles of socialism: the government ownership of post offices. We all know that part of the payment to the National Party and the policy promise made to the National Farmers Federation was to deliver these ISDN services right around Australia by 1 July 1997. Let me make it clear to the minister that there is no agreement on time limits on this debate, and I will certainly take this opportunity to go through all of the points that he has provoked the opposition on in his summing up in the second reading debate. That is the first thing: the false claim by the minister in his contribution tonight that the government, with this package, has met its commitments to the bush. It does not meet the commitments which your leader, John Howard, gave the Australian people before the election. You cannot walk away from the commitments that Honest John has, allegedly honestly, given the people of Australia. The second point I make is the bogus claim by the minister that in some way it is anticompetitive to guarantee that, wherever you live in Australia, you should have access to cheaper local calls. I challenge the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government to tell his constituents in Launceston why they should miss out on the price reductions in local calls that Joe Hockey, the member for North Sydney, will be delivering to the people in his electorate. I would also challenge the minister to visit the electorate of Robertson, the electorate of my friend and colleague Jim Lloyd, who is in the chamber at the moment. How will he explain to the pensioners in Umina? Mr Reith interjecting",102
176,Mr LEE,AYES,"I say to the Leader of the House that I checked and there is no agreement on how long this particular debate is going to go. We will be reasonable with this. Mr Reith-What we are trying to do is to finish matters by tomorrow night. There is an agreement, and that requires people to be reasonable.",107
177,Mr LEE,AYES,I make the point that there are a number of issues that we will certainly explore in detail as a result of the interruption tonight of the Leader of the House. Mrs Bishop-Don't rabbit on.,107
178,Mr LEE,AYES,"It might be all right for the minister at the table to sling abuse across the chamber, because her constituents will benefit from the cheaper local calls, but the constituents of the minister sitting next to her will not. Next time you are in Launceston, why don't you try to explain to the people there why they should not get cheaper local calls when your constituents in Palm Beach and all of the other northern beach suburbs of Sydney should. Mr Fitzgibbon-What about the people of the Hunter?",107
179,Mr LEE,AYES,"My colleague interjects and says, 'What about the constituents in the electorate of Hunter?' I can certainly inform the House that this is one country member who has spoken loudly on many occasions for his constituents, and even the constituents in the electorate of Paterson, to benefit from the cheaper local calls. Because of the result of this debate here tonight, the only way you can guarantee that that will take place is if the Democrats, the Greens, and perhaps even Senator Colston and Senator Harradine, vote with the Labor Party when we move amendments in the other place to try to guarantee that, wherever Australians live, they get access to cheaper calls. We are pushing this right to the limit because it is quite clear what will happen. Optus Vision is not rolling out its cable network in Launceston. It is not even roIling out its cable network in some of the capital cities. It certainly is in the electorate of Mackellar, and it certainly is in the electorate of the Prime Minister. If you go to Hunters Hill you can see the cables being rolled out. They are the people who will benefit from cheaper local calls when Optus Vision's local call system is fully operational. Optus Vision is promising 20e local calls or lower. Under the government's package Telstra will be able to match those prices. If not, it will offer customers in those areas 18c local calls to take Optus Vision on head-tohead. Let us not say it is anti-competitive; let us say they simply match Optus Vision's prices in those suburbs. Let us say Telstra offers a 20c local call, equal to the Optus Vision call. But let us say Telstra only wants to offer it in the suburbs where Optus Vision has rolled out its network. If Telstra wants to maximise its profits, if Telstra executives want to maximise the productivity bonuses that they have, that is what Telstra will do. If the government wants Telstra to provide the largest possible dividend to the government, the government will be quite happy for Telstra to drop the prices only in the areas where Optus Vision has rolled out its cable. Minister, with the package you have had passed through the second reading stage here today, the package that is before the House now for the third reading debate, you will let Telstra do that: you will let Telstra offer the lower prices in the electorate of the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), in Hunters Hill, and in the electorate of the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), but not in the Hunter Valley, not in Launceston and not on the Central Coast of New South Wales. We think this legislation is a great mistake. We believe that, since Telstra is no longer 100 per cent government owned, the government cannot ensure that those social responsibilities are met. We think that this is a measure that should be included in the Telecommunications Bill 1996. The Labor Party will be moving accordingly in the Senate. The other point I wish to make is that the minister in passing said that the debate about directory assistance is an issue that has probably passed us by, then he corrected himself by saying the debate on the issue has passed us by. I hate to break this to you, Minister, but as the minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) in the House of Representatives, you do not seem to be aware of the fact that Telstra is still out there lobbying, still out there briefing people, telling people about their proposal-their 'informal' proposal; it is not a formal proposal, of course; it is an informal proposal-to charge people SOc when they ring directory assistance. Mr Martin Ferguson-It's a core proposal.",107
180,Mr LEE,AYES,"I say to my colleague I suspect it is a core proposal. It is a proposal that start showing up on people's telephone bills before too much longer unless the parliament acts to make sure that that is prohibited under the legislative package. I can say to my colleagues that I have already raised concerns about this issue. If Telstra does get approval from the government to introduce a SOc fee for numbers that are in the telephone white pages, sure, Telstra will offer a $S discount on your rental. But how long will it be before Telstra claws that back through increases in your quarterly rental? They will claw that back, but you will be paying for directory assistance for all time. That certainly will not be forgiven by Telstra, and it is certainly not something that will disappear. They will claw back any reduction in the quarterly rental, but the charge will be there whenever you ring directory assistance for a number that is in the white pages. Many do not realise how many people have difficulty in looking up numbers in the white pages. A group of constituents raised this issue with me-residents of North Entrance in my own electorate-last Friday at an afternoon tea. Many of them made the point that elderly people often have difficulty not only reading the numbers, but even being able to see some of the numbers because of the way that Telstra binds its books these days. It is very hard for some elderly people to get the books open wide enough for them to see all the numbers that are printed closest to the binding. Is it fair to charge those pensioners SOc every time they need to obtain a phone number that is in the phone book? Telstra quite misleadingly claims that it loses $200 million on directory assistance. Telstra never factors into this that when someone rings directory assistance they do not do it because they love to talk to the operators; they do it because they like to make telephone calls-they want to contact someone. Telstra gets revenue after the subscriber has been given a number. That is not factored in when Telstra makes these misleading claims about the cost of providing directory assistance. But, most importantly of all, the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister made a promise will before the last election-Honest John made an honest promise-that there would be no charging for directory assistance. That is one promise we are going to make sure he does not forget. He made the great mistake of repeating that promise in this chamber last year. He repeated the statement in the chamber last year that there would be no charging for directory assistance. In the Senate, we seek to alter this package so that this govern- dollars. ment cannot sneak through the introduction of charging for directory assistance. For all those reasons, we are disappointed the government was not prepared to accept our second reading amendment. We believe that this package remains flawed. We will not be pressing amendments in detail in this House-we will keep our powder dry for the Senate-but we want to point out to the government that its sneaky attempts to claim that it has met its commitments to the bush are completely false. It has failed to deliver on its promises on ISDN. John Howard has tried to sneak and slide away from that promise which he made to the National Farmers Federation. The government is trying to break its guarantee not to introduce a charge for directory assistance. The government believes it is important for Telstra's customers in the exclusive North Shore suburbs of Sydney and suburbs like Toorak in Melbourne to get cheaper local calls, while people who live in the rest of Australia should miss out. That is the Liberal philosophy for Australia. It is a philosophy that we will seek to have amended in the Senate when this debate continues in that place.",108
181,Mr KATTER,AYES,"Kennedy) (9.29 p.m.)Whilst we would most certainly agree with the sentiments expressed by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) on this issue, by the same token his own government and he himself as minister fell very far short of achieving those objectives. I most certainly did not see any commitment from their side, so his stating that he has no commitment here does not change the position for us people in the bush whatsoever. I would like to put on record the fact that we got three assurances from the minister. The first is that where we have a service that is deficient because of breakdown faults or because of structural faults we would be able to contest Telstra in the courts in an affordable manner, which means in something like the small claims tribunals that operate in so many states, where legal representation is excluded. We will not have the repetition of the terrible COT cases which have cost will Telstra and the individuals many millions of The second undertaking we were given, which I hope will be honoured-and I refer to the shadow minister's speech-was that the Australian Communications Authority will be controlled by the people of Australia through the parliament of Australia. The third undertaking we have been given is for the installation of ISDN. I hope this undertaking will be honoured in spite of what the opposition spokesman has said because otherwise all of country Australia would be placed very much as second-class citizens.

182,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I thank the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and his staff for allowing slightly unusual treatment of these four cognate health bills. Firstly, I will speak on the first two bills of this four-bill package and then I will speak on the other two bills. The debate will take place with members being able to speak on all four bills. The reason I am doing this is to set out quite clearly that the opposition is adopting quite a different strategy in its approach to the various pairs of bills that make up this package of four. Perhaps people will understand my reasons for doing this as I go along. Turning to the centrepiece of this particular package, these bills are really an attempt by the government to deliver what they would claim is the centrepiece of the coalition's health policy at the last election. It is a policy that the Labor Party believes has already begun to unravel and, before a year is out, we suspect there will be clear evidence that this centrepiece of the health policy of the Liberal and National parties will be in complete ruins. There were two parts to the policy which the Prime Minister, John Howard, took to the Australian people at the last election. First, he promised to maintain Medicare in its entirety-a promise which the government has been seeking to walk away from as each day passes. Second, he promised to introduce a $1. 7 billion package to provide people with incentives to take out private health insurance. I think you have to ask yourself what sort of a government would come up with a health policy that is, in effect, really an emasculated son of Fightback and certainly has the same intentions. Perhaps there was not as much courage to tell the Australian people about what they were setting out to achieve. We certainly have a private health insurance policy that is based on ignorance and prejudice and threatens long-term damage to the Medicare system. This policy must be condemned because it breaks a key election promise: a promise not to cut public funding to pay for private subsidies. It is a policy that should also be condemned because it is extremely inefficient and a waste of scarce health dollars. In A Healthy Future, the opposition's health policy, there was the following promise: The incentive will not be funded from the public hospital system or health grants to the States. than $50 million which will be reallocated from the Better Practice Program, the incentive will be funded entirely from savings outside the Health and Human Services portfolio. That was a promise from the Prime Minister and Dr Wooldridge. Last year's budget demonstrated how totally and cynically this promise was broken. Within months of this promise, the coalition had slashed grants to the states by $1.5 billion over three years, which in themselves represented a cut of around $500 million to the states' health funding, which comprises approximately a third of the funding on health expenditure. In addition, as a result of the coalition's budget cuts, there were direct funding cuts to our public hospitals-funding cuts of more than $300 million over four years-as well as other massive cuts to health expenditures totalling more than $3 billion over four years. So the promise that was made in A Healthy Future-not to make cuts in the public hospital system to pay for these new incentives to encourage people to take out private health insurance-was a promise that has been completely and utterly broken. The standard Liberal-National Party response to demonstrations by the Labor Party that the government has broken its promises is a claim that the deficit was larger than they expected when they were in opposition. There are the usual various references to a:,: Ick hole. Then the government seeks to e\,l; ,e the fact that it has walked away comp!cLely from the undertakings that were made before the election. I think there has been a lot of focus in my own electorate on the difficulty the government has had in discovering its own black hole a little bit earlier this year. There is no denying that there was a lot of goodwill towards this government at the election. It won by a big margin. A lot of my Lahor colleagues were defeated-with big swin-s against the Labor Party in many scats across the country. There i \ no dl'\1 J-...t "",.hat ,never that there was a lot of goodwill towards the government. Mr Howard, in no small measure, picked up Other votes from people who had not been prepared to trust the Liberal Party at previous elections because of what they said they would do to Medicare, because of what they said they would do to our universal health care system. So when John Howard, with that triple bypass, re-elected as Leader of the Liberal Party, put his hand on his heart and said that he would maintain Medicare in its entirety, I am sure there were a lot of people in my electorate who found that a very important factor that they took into account before making up their own minds as to how they should vote at that last election. I am sure lots of people who voted Liberal, maybe for the first time in their lives at the last election, were worried about what might happen to health care under a Liberal government, but that commitment from John Howard might have pushed them over the limit and helped convince them to take the Liberal Party on trust, and to take on trust commitments like this, that any incentives to encourage people to take out private health insurance would not be funded by cuts in our public hospital system. That was the sort of commitment that day after day John Howard and Michael Wooldridge, as the spokesman, were making to the Australian people. But, within a few months of them being elected, they set out on a deliberate strategy to cut into Medicare, to wind back the rebates and to cut back federal funding for public hospitals. There is no doubt that many people are now starting to worry about whether that commitment by John Howard, the Prime Minister, will be met in this coming budget or the one after. It is common knowledge that, in clddition to the billions of dollars of cuts in health funding in the last hudget, right up unti I the last minute there was a proposal to introduce a ('0payment. I am pleased that the Prime Minister apparently intervened and stopped that going ahead. If there is ever a proposal from Finance to iIll: luce a similar charge, I hope that he also mtervenes to stop that going ahead. There is already some newspaper speculation about a $4 cut in rebates for GP visits. Even if the Prime Minister does not let those sorts of co-payments come in, there would be a very clear breach of faith over that promise. Even if he does no more than he did in the last election, the cuts in the state funding for their public hospitals, the extra cuts in direct federal funding for public hospitals, the reductions in Commonwealth funding for our dental health program and the reductions in funding for our pharmaceutical benefits scheme have all been ways in which the government has cut back the public system, the universal system, to fund this massive subsidy for private health insurance. These have been breaches of the promise that was made by the Prime Minister before the last election. It has certainly undermined some of the basic foundations of our health care system. The Minister for Health and Family Services has tried to justify some of the cutbacks that have been made to fund this initiative that is before the House tonight by saying that there has been some cost shifting in our funding of public hospitals in days gone by. He is right, there has been some cost shifting. There is no doubt about that; it is silly to deny it. In fact, I am prepared to say that I think many public hospitals have cost shifted to the Commonwealth. But there is no denying that the Commonwealth has also cost shifted onto many public hospitals. If you talk to any chief executives of any of our public hospitals around the country, they will tell you that there are many patients who are using state funded hospital beds in our public hospitals who clearly should be in nursing home beds that are funded by the Commonwealth, not by the states. So, every day one of those patients is in a hospital funded by states and not in a nursing home bed funded by the Commonwealth, that is cost shifting from the Commonwealth government onto the public hospital. In rural and regional areas-and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, from your own experience will be aware of this-there is even greater pressure on the public hospital budgets. So, yes, there is cost shifting from hospitals to the Commonwealth and, at the same time, there is cost shifting in the other direction onto those very tight budgets that the chief executives have for hospitals around the country. Pretty well every public hospital I have ever seen is running on a very tight budget. Hospitals around the country are having to make all sorts of tough decisions just to keep beds open, to keep staff employed and to keep some of the operating theatres going. In some cases, hospitals have had to cost shift onto the Commonwealth just to try to keep their waiting lists under control, to try to make sure that people who are on those waiting lists are not in pain. Dr Wooldridge comes in and declares cost shifting is taking place instead of giving more money to the public hospitals to fix the problem. Dr Wooldridge must be the only doctor in Australia who thinks he has solved the problem by giving less money to the public hospitals. Dr Wooldridge must be the only doctor in Australia who wants to give less money to our public hospitals, because that is what he did in the last budget. In the last budget, the government made no attempt whatsoever to increase federal funding for public hospitals-in fact, they did the reverse. They took a total of $800 million from federal funding for public hospitals-an $800 million reduction in funding that goes towards treating patients in our public hospitals, in making sure that people are not out there on waiting lists and waiting for operations to take place. In considering this measure tonight of the benefits that flow from a new incentive for private health insurance, we have also got to consider what cuts have been made to pay for this incentive. As I have said before, it is a $1.7 billion incentive over the next three years from 1 July. It is being funded by an $800 million cut in funding for our public hospitals, it is being paid for by a $500 million cut in our pharmaceutical benefits scheme and it is being funded by a $400 million cut in the Commonwealth dental health program. Fancy telling people who are in pain when they chew food that they are no longer entitled to a Commonwealth funded dental health program. Mr Hockey-The program was going to go.",111
183,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for North Sydney interjects and says that the program was going to go. The member for North Sydney claims to know a bit about finance and he is well known in the Liberal corridors for skiting about his knowledge of financial matters. If, as the honourable member says, the program was going to go, why is it that the budget papers claim that there was a $400 million saving? If there was a saving, that proves that, in the forward estimates, this Commonwealth dental health program was expected to be rolled over, and Finance knew it was going to be rolled over. The Labor government intended to roll it over. The only ones who were not prepared to keep funding it were the Liberal and National parties. Mr Hockey interjecting",114
184,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"And your attitude to this program-with a flippant interjection-just demonstrates you don't care about many elderly people in your own electorate who will now have to pay money. People on very low incomes will now have to pay money for a service that they have previously received free of charge. In many cases, it will not matter how much people offer to pay. They won't be able to get into the programs run by the state governments. They will just have to wait-in some cases, years-before they get treatment. It is only when you go to the dental clinics and meet the people in the waiting rooms and talk to the dedicated staff that you realise cruel a cutback this $400 million from the Commonwealth dental health program was. The member for North Sydney might roll his eyes. Perhaps he might come with me on some future visit to a state of his choosing. We will visit one of the dental health clinics. The member for North Sydney should talk to the people in those waiting rooms and to people who are embarrassed to go out because there are problems with their teeth and they are embarrassed to smile. It affects their diet and their attitude to life. This decision is something that is going to affect tens of thousands of Australians on very modest incomes. I think the Age described it as the cruellest cut in the federal budget and one that we can only hope might be revisited at some future time; one that we can only hope can be changed. I am dwelling on these because, to get the $1. 7 billion to subsidise private health insurance, they have had to make $1.7 billion of cuts in health--cuts in federal funding for public hospitals, cuts in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and cuts in the Commonwealth dental health program. These are the sorts of changes that we think are not in Australia's national interest. It is certainly totally contrary to the promise which John Howard gave before the last election not to cut from the public system to fund this new incentive for people with private health insurance. Just look at the cutbacks to public hospitals of $800 million over three years. That is equivalent to closing 1,000 beds or turning away 66,000 people waiting for operations. That is what that sort of sum of money means. In contrast, there are six million Australians who are eligible for health concession cards today in Australia. There are also around six million Australians who currently have private health insurance. What this bill before the House tonight does is to take away from that first group, the six million Australians with health care cards, to deliver a benefit to the six million people in the second group, those with private health insurance. Sure, some pensioners are in both groups. Some pensioners scrimp and save to how maintain their private health insurance. They are probably neither better off nor worse off as a result of this decision. The people on middle incomes who have private health insurance will probably be significantly better off. As a result of the cuts implemented by this government, there will be a very large number of people on very low incomes who will pay significantly as a result of the cuts that are being made to federal funding for public hospitals, pharmaceutical benefits and the Commonwealth dental health program. So it is not fair by any measure. In many ways, this policy will force pensioners to wait longer for elective surgery because of the public hospital cutbacks. They will pay more for their essential medicines and significantly so in states like Victoria, where they have introduced new co-payments for people to have basic dental care. I am sure that many of my colleagues will be pointing out some of the consequences of this legislation in some more detail. For Liberal Party members to suggest that a single pensioner will magically find $800 to take out private health insurance simply to get the benefit of a $125 incentive is just ridiculous. It is the same sort of logic that has the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, claiming that pensioners who are being forced to pay an extra 50c for every script will not suffer hardship. It is certainly hardship that has triggered a lot of letters to me in the last few months. Not only is the government's policy horrendously unfair; it is also incredibly inefficient. Recent figures showing the number of Australians maintaining their private health insurance are showing that it is also quite ineffective. Some people might say, 'Well, this is what we expect to hear from an opposition. Oppositions are always against things.' So let me quote a few other views that have been expressed about this legislation. The first is from an organisation that is not a well-known supporter of the Labor Party. The AMA have suggested that money could be better spent on purchasing hospital beds directly. Mr Martin Ferguson-Brendan's mates.",114
185,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Yes, the mates of the honourable member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson). The AMA, certainly no friend of the Labor Party, have been suggesting that the money could have been better spent on purchasing hospital beds directly in either public or private hospitals. At the last election, the Labor Party view was that we should give people a choice. They could either take this as a subsidy to reduce the cost of their private health insurance or use it as a family health rebate to meet the cost of some of their medical bills. We believe that to offer people a choice was a much fairer mechanism, because two-thirds of Australians out there do not have private health insurance and they get nothing from this legislation. They get nothing that helps meet the cost of their medical bills. We think that would have been a much fairer measure. So the AMA thinks the money should have been spent directly on helping people in our hospitals. Even the government's own Industry Commission criticised the efficiency of the incentives when it said, 'The net budgetary cost of the incentives is likely to be quite large.' This is the Industry Commission's polite way of saying that the government is wasting more than a billion dollars. On the commission's own figures, the government will spend $560 million a year on the incentives that will only lead to savings of $240 million. That is the benefit we will actually see in the public hospitals. You have to ask: if they are spending $560 million a year to get a benefit of only $240 million a year in reducing the pressure on our public hospitals, why the hell didn't they spend the whole $560 million in helping reduce the waiting times in our public hospitals? Why didn't they spend the money directly in assisting people who are out there waiting for surgery? Why have they wasted the difference between the $560 million and the $240 million? Why have they spent that on providing people with a reduction in the cost of their health insurance instead of spending it directly on our hospital system, public or private? I will tell you the reason they did that. This was part of the fistful of dollars at the last election. A fistful of dollars is a new thing for John Howard the Prime Minister, but not a new thing for John Howard the man in public life. The Prime Minister, in a previous life when he was the Treasurer of Australia, was actually part of the Liberal Party campaign in the period between 1977 and 1980-a long time ago-a period when John Howard as Treasurer had a strong commitment to indexation of income tax thresholds. That was the last time the Liberal Party was using that fistful of dollars to try to win votes at an election. The opposition is intending to test the government on its merits and test the government on its commitment to the introduction of this change by seeking to move in the consideration in detail stage to index income thresholds in this particular measure. Before I get to that, perhaps this is a convenient time for me to move my proposed second reading amendment-an amendment that I believe points out in some detail the opposition's concerns about this particular bill. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (l) deplores the Federal Government cuts to public hospitals, pharmaceuticals and public dental services which have been made to fund these incentives in direct breach of an election promise; (2) is dismayed by the inefficiency of the measures which will do little to ease the funding pressure on public hospitals; and (3) is firmly of the opinion that the $1.7 billion would be better spent in providing extra Federal Government funding for public hospitals and direct subsidies for private hospital accommodation"" . One of the reasons why we believe this proposal that is before the House is a cruel hoax is that it is quite clear that the government's proposals just are not going to work. The government announced with great fanfare the introduction of these incentives with the last budget, but within days we had the health funds queuing up to increase their premiums. In fact there were some suggestions that the minister actually knew before the budget that the health funds would be queuing up for these increases. A press release he issued on budget night was a dash misleading, but that is an issue we have touched on in previous question times. The point I want to make is that, while the government was claiming that this rebate would deliver reductions in the cost of private health insurance to people, the minister was claiming that he would make sure that the full benefit of this incentive would remain in the pockets of contributors. What in fact has happened? Within days of the budget we had HBA in Victoria announcing increases of six per cent. Then we had Australian Unity increasing their premiums by 8.6 per cent. Then we had the Prime Minister's direct intervention where he said that any future increases would have to have his personal approval and the approval of the Treasurer and the health minister. What did we have as a result? The government was approving massive increases in the size of health insurance premiums. Manchester Unity had a 17V2 per cent increase. HBA in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory had increases of about nine per cent. Then in November, by coincidence, almost at the very minute President Clinton was speaking in this chamber to the joint sitting, we had a press release come out from MBF and Medibank Private announcing increases of 12.9 per cent and 15 per cent. In Victoria, where Medibank Private has a large proportion of its members, the increases were as high as 23 per cent. I still have some doubts about the figures which the minister and Medibank Private were using in trying to claim that the Medibank Private increase was only 12.9 per cent. In December last year I requested an explanation from both Medibank Private and the minister as to how they get this average increase of 12.9 per cent. Now, eight or nine weeks later, I am still waiting for an explanation. Medibank Private still cannot provide the shadow minister for health with a piece of paper telling us what the increases have been across the different tables, despite our many requests. You have to ask yourself whether that 12.9 per cent increase is valid. We do know that the minister and the Prime Minister have claimed that they were responsible for talking down the level of these increases, but no-one has ever been able to provide the opposition or the Australian people with any evidence that tries to back up this claim. As a result of that, we remain quite sceptical about the minister's claims in this area. I certainly think that the large number of Australians out there who might have been prepared to give the government the benefit of the doubt in that they were offering this subsidy for people for their private health insurance, perhaps giving the Liberals the benefit of the doubt at the last election, 11 months later-as we are getting close to the first anniversary of the election of the government-they are saying quite clearly that there will be very little left of this health insurance incentive by the time it begins to be paid on 1 July. There will be very little of it left because of the increases in premiums that have taken place. So we can expect that the reduction in the number of Australians who have maintained their private health insurance will continue to erode. The other point that I would like to make this evening is that it has become clear to the opposition from a briefing, which I am grateful to the minister for arranging, that in order to apply for this incentive members of the public will be required to estimate their own annual income and to provide certain other information to the government. What I find amazing is that apparently Australians will have to fill out a IS-page form before they will be entitled to get this private health insurance incentive. The government, which claims it is committed to reducing red tape, is asking people to fill out a IS-page form to get this rebate. I really do think the government has to go back and ask itself if it is trying hard enough. If you cannot get an application form for a health insurance rebate in less than a few pages, there is something seriously wrong. I think most Australians out there are going to be pretty outraged that they have to jump through all these hoops before they are entitled to receive the benefit from this health insurance rebate. I would certainly be concerned about how many public servants will be employed to process these IS-page forms or, if they are going to be processed by the private health funds, how many extra staff the private health funds are going to have to employ to process all these new bits of paper that the government is going to impose upon us. For all of these reasons, we will not be seeking to block this legislation. We do not believe it would be right to punish the contributors because this government has stuffed up private health insurance. We think it would be wrong to penalise the Australians who took this government on good faith when they expected a reduction in their private health insurance premiums. But those people out there realise that, as a result of the premium increases that this government has presided over, there will be very little benefit left by the time that IS-page form is filled out, completed and lodged. Certainly, if they have not got writer's cramp by the time they are through with filling out that IS-page form, they will have wallet cramp because the health insurance premium increases will have swallowed up much of that benefit by the time it comes through. The opposition will not be opposing this bill, but we believe it is to be deplored that these cutbacks have been made in our public hospital system, in pharmaceutical services and in the dental health system to pay for this new concession. We certainly think that, in hindsight, the government should come clean and admit that it would have been much better for us to have spent this money directly on helping people who were sick, in making sure more operations could· be performed, in making sure operating theatres were operating longer and in making sure that all Australians got a benefit from the expenditure of this $1.7 billion.",115
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Martyn Evans-I second the motion. Debate (on motion by Mr Warwick Smith) adjourned. NA BILL (No.2) 1996 Cognate bill: NA (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 December 1996, on motion by Dr Wooldridge: That the bill be now read a second time.",117
187,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996 seeks to increase the Medicare levy for people who do not have private health insurance whose incomes are over certain levels, and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Private Health Insurance Incentives) Bill 1996 is the government's second attempt to impose its tax on the sick by increasing the threshold and making it harder for ordinary taxpayers who have significant health bills to get any tax rebate if their out-of-pocket medical expenses exceed certain thresholds. I move as a second reading amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with the view to substituting the following words: ""the House is of the opinion that the Bill should not be proceeded with unless all of the revenue raised by the measures in this Bill is used to increase Federal Government funding for public hospitals"". The opposition will be voting against this legislation in the House of Representatives if the government does not withdraw the bill and amend it in the way we have indicated in the second reading amendment. We are not seeking to block the imposition of the Medicare levy on people whose incomes exceed the thresholds nominated by the government if they have not taken out private health insurance, but we will only support that if the government shows it is fair dinkum about this measure by making sure that all of the money raised through this new Medicare levy is spent as extra federal funding for public hospitals. You are going to hear a lot about public hospitals over the next two years because the Labor opposition believes that our public hospital system is the pressure point in our health care system in Australia today. The cuts that this government has made in federal funding for public hospitals-$800 million cuts in federal funding for public hospitalswill make the pressures in the public hospital system even worse. The waiting lists will get longer. We are going to see, right around Australia, the pressures in our public hospital system get worse. The measures before the House are the result of broken promises. The government promised before the last election no new taxes. This is the second occasion on which we have seen the Medicare levy increased. The first occasion was for the gun buyback, and that was a measure which the Labor opposition, in a bipartisan way, agreed to support. But it makes the point that, when the government on two occasions within 12 months increases the Medicare levy, it is quite clear that the undertaking made by the then shadow Treasurer, Peter Costello-that is, that there would never be an increase in taxes under John Howard as Prime Minister-has been disposed of, not as a core promise but as a disposable promise. Despite this being a massive breach of promise, we believe that this policy is slick and cunning. By announcing this policy close to the budget, the government sought to put a ribbon around it. This is the Medicare levy ribbon wrapped around last year's budget-a nice pink ribbon and a bow-to try to make it look like this was an attractive measure to ordinary Australians because it was a new tax on people on high incomes. The reason we say that this is slick and cunning is that, in fact, the vast majority of people earning more than the income thresholds in the bill already have private health insurance. Despite the big song and dance the Treasurer made in the week or two after the election, the figures from the health department show that only 110,000 singles and 100,000 couples and families will be affected by the increase. That's why it is cunning: it seems to hit the rich but it'is only really window dressing because most people on those high incomes already escape the test that is applied by this government. In fact, our biggest worry is this penalty levy, the nice little pink bow that people might think is a nice little narrow bow that affects only people on high incomes. It is actually starting off as a thin bow, but we are very worried that within a few years this ribbon is going to totally envelop every Australian or all Australians on quite low incomes. What stops this government-having introduced the levy at this income threshold of $100,000 for families this year-later claiming that the Costello black hole has meant that it has had to reconsider its position on this issue? What stops Treasurer Costello getting up on the budget this year to announce an amendment in the income threshold, bringing it down from $100,000 to $80,000? What stops Treasurer Costello, if he is still the Treasurer when the budget after is brought down, lowering it from $80,000 to $60,000 in the following budget? The only thing that we can guarantee is that this new Medicare levy, which starts out with a $100,000 threshold today, is going to have a threshold a lot lower than $100,000 before this government is all through, however early we may wish that would happen. That is why we are going to be moving another set of amendments in the consideration in detail stage that will seek to index those income tax thresholds. We are going to try to make sure that these thresholds are maintained by an appropriate indexation mechanism that tries to apply force to this government. If, at any time in the future, this government seek to manipulate and use this Medicare levy to force more people into private health insurance, we are going make sure they stand naked and exposed. We are going to force these people to come into this chamber and argue why they want to see a two-tier health system develop in Australia, because this is the thin edge of the wedge for the introduction of a two-tier health system. It is no surprise that this is happening in health. In last year's budget, we saw it happening in universities. We see the introduction of full fees being charged for some Australian students and free university education for others. I am sure that this mix might also change in future years. We are seeing it in nursing homes. My colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), who is present in the House, understands probably more than any other Australian the implications that the introduction of this two-tier system in nursing home care is going to have for ordinary Australians right across this country. Certain people who perhaps can afford to pay $200,000 as an up-front entry fee will get the Rolls-Royce nursing home roomMr MCArthur-Just like Keating did.",117

There are a lot of people in my own electorate who will not be able to afford $1,000 up-front entry fee. They are people on very modest incomes who live on the base pension. They will not be able to afford it.",119

192,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am embarrassed to say that this Medicare levy is going to do things like fund these nursing homes. This Medicare levy measure is the thin edge of the wedge in the introduction of this two-tier system in health care in the same way that we have had the introduction in the last budget of a two-tier system in university funding and a two-tier system for funding nursing homes. I certainly believe that it is a backward step for us to have this development in health care in Australia. No doubt every member of the government that gets up to speak in this debate will say, 'Graham Richardson told us to do it. We are not really doing this because we believe it but because Graham Richardson told us to do it.' Mr MCArthur-Do what Graham says!",119
193,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"'Do what Graham says!' the member for Corangamite interjects. I have to break it to the member for Corangamite that, if he wants to do what Graham - aid, he must accept the opposition's amendment because the Graham Richardson proposll--however flawed it may have been and even if it did risk introducing a two-tier s .. , 'n in his 'I a high,;r Medicare levy for people over certain income levels who did not take out T rivate health insurance, on the one condition' [hat all of the money raised through that e,!rl Medicare levy went back in extra funding for public hospitals. So, if you want to do what Graham told you, you will accept the opposition amendments and you will make sure that any money raised from this levy goes into putting extra money into our public hospital system that is under so much pressure at the moment. As we can certainly make clear, there is a billion dollar difference between this government and the Labor Party on funding public hospitals. An $800 million cut in federal funding for public hospitals, announced in last year's budget, stands in contrast to the promise at the last election by the Labor Party to increase our funding for public hospitals by $150 million. That is the gap: a billion dollars. Just think how many. extra operations could be performed for a billion dollar injection into our public hospital system-an injection which the AMA believes is overdue and an injection which the Industry Commission says should happen-rather than through this government's flawed health place insurance incentive. Finally, I turn to the second part of the last bill which makes up the government's package: the government's second attempt to introduce a tax on the sick by increasing threshold for out-of-pocket medical expenses before people start to get the benefit of the tax rebate. I can gi ve you the example of pensioner in my electorate who has been forced by the government's cuts in the system to pay an additional $700 a year for an antifungal cream for his wife bedridden, having suffered a stroke. The increase in this threshold will make things even harder for my constituent and his wife. It is of course another broken promise, other increase in taxes, another breach of Treasurer's commitment made before the election, and it is another attack on those can least afford it. For those reasons, we remain hopeful that the opposition's second reading amendment will be accepted and carried by this House.",119

He accuses us. of being naked and exposed but the what we actually see is him standing before us tonight naked and exposed, and it is not a pretty sight. We have all been rather amused a and entertained by the Four Corners program tonight, 'Hard Labor'. What we have seen in PBS the House with the member for Dobell's speech is simply a continuation of that saga. who is It has been interesting. Four Corners told us how they were going back to basics, they had thrown out all their policies and they were starting all over again. anI wonder whether the member for Dobell's the speech is an example of this new start. The last amendments that he has moved to these who particular bills seem to give an inkling of some policy direction that we might see more of. Apparently, point (3) in the first amendment he moved suggests that there should be direct subsidies for private hospital accommodation. I wonder whether that is something that he might want to enlarge on. Not tonight; you have already had plenty tonight, if you do mind. But at some time you might want to enlarge on that.",120
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,The member for Dobell will resume his seat. That was a rhetorical invitation.,121
197,Mr BRADFORD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Apparently the whole thesis that they are putting before us is that the money that we are putting in in this legislation to provide subsidies for private health insurance would have been better spent on the public hospital system. Up until March last year we had 13 years of Labor government-13 years when they had the opportunity to fix the problems in the public health system. They were obviously and notoriously unsuccessful at doing that. We have come to government with a plan to address the problems in the public health system. Apparently, they do not accept that, despi te the fact that, as the member for Dobell said, Graham Richardson thought it was a good idea, not that we have necessarily taken his advice word for word. But the principle which he subscribed to-and he was absolutely correct-was that part of the problem with the public system was the fact that the private system had been strangled under Labor to such an extent that people were leaving the private system in droves and going into the public system, which was not adequately funded to cope with them. The Labor Party described this legislation that we have put before the parliament as a cruel hoax. But what the Australian people had imposed on them under their systemunder the Medicare system-was, in fact, a cruel hoax itself because it held out to Australians that we would have this great free public health system. What happened? Quite predictably, it just could not cope. Hence, we have long waiting lists in all of our hospitals. For older constituents of mine, getting surgery like hip replacements can take up to two or three years. I have constituents still calling me, as they did in the Labor years, complaining about that two-year wait. A hip in need of replacement may not he life-threatening but it certamly is qualit: III ;;fe threatening and it is totally unacceptable that people should be forced to wait, often immohile, in their homes fOl two or three years for a hip replacement. The solution to the problem is relatively simple. I hope that the member for Dobell can understand it. If he thought about it, he would acknowledge it. You have to get people out of the public hospital system-out of those queues-and back into the private system. But you never really philosophically wanted the private system to work. In 13 years the former government set about to destroy the private health system. They almost succeeded. With the election of the Howard government a year ago we set about putting in place a program which would rescue the private health system and do what the former government said originally-that Medicare and the private system would complement each other and co-exist. Whilst that was said as part of the rationale, the introduction of Medicare was never delivered because they never really wanted it to happen. I want to deal with a couple of things that the member for Dobell said. I am happy that he left me about six minutes in which to say these things while Australia is listening out there. He had the audacity to talk about the private health fund increases-the premium rises. He was being quite disingenuous about this. Let me ask the question: in 13 years of Labor government, how many increases in private health fund premiums did the Labor Party stop? The answer is none-n-o-n-e, none. Each premium increase that was sought by the private health funds was granted by the Labor Party. Under Labor, average private health insurance premiums rose by 12 per cent per year. Yet you have the audacity to criticise our reaction to the approval of those, I must admit in some senses, badly timed increases. Debate interrupted. NA",121
198,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Immigration Aged Care",121
199,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"F()r many of us, much of last year \, as spent. both in this House and outside it, talking about immigration and the benefits a robust and diverse immigration program bring to this country not only in an economic sense but also in a cultural and social sense. Mr Bradford-Can you speak a bit faster?",121
200,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"I will take on the honourable member any time he would care to choose. During these discussions, I am sure that many members would have harked back to the history of immigration in Australia, especially the postwar years when literally millions of migrants came to these shores from a Europe which lay in devastation. As we would all know, a great many of the migrants who arrived in Australia, both before and after World War II, came from Italy. And what a contribution these people have made to this country of ours. Our entire social landscape has changed beyond recognition with their presence, and for the better. There are a number of pockets in Australia which are synonymous with Italians and Italian culture-Carlton in Melbourne, Leichhardt in Sydney and Griffith in south-western New South Wales. My pocket of Sydney, the seat of Prospect in south-western Sydney, is also famous for its large Italian population. The area in and around Prospect actually contains the largest number of Italian-born individuals in Australia-never mind the second, third and fourth generation Italian Australians who have also chosen to call that area their home. In Prospect you will find one of the major focal points of the Italian community in Australia-the Marconi Club, which I am proud to say I have been a member of for 37 years. In Prospect you will find the market gardens, which were started by Italian farmers more than 70 years ago. You will find throughout my electorate literally hundreds of small businesses, restaurants and community clubs all with names which identify their Italian heritage and each one a symbol of the hard work and determination these people brought to our community. Over the last 50, 60 and even 70 years, the pioneers of this mass migration from Italy capitalised on the opportunities that Australia presented to them. Their sons, daughters and grandchildren are now carrying on their work. For the great majority of these pioneers, their days of toiling in their market garden or manning the family business are over. The majority of them have now reached retirement age and face the same unique set of problems which confront the elderly, whatever their cultural background. While the need for sometimes greater care and attention is an accepted fact for the aged of all nationalities, it must be recognised that the elderly in our migrant communities-in this case, those of Italian heritage-{)ften have specific cultural needs which must be catered for when providing aged services. With such a culturally specific and particularly large population suddenly reaching old age in south-western Sydney, I am sure members present can imagine the problems our community faces in providing for their general and individual needs. A group by the name of the South-west Italo-Australian Association, which formed in my area roughly two years ago, has stepped into the breach and set about remedying the undersupply of aged care services in southwestern Sydney specifically designed for the Italian-Australian community. I am proud to offer them, my full support. The association's main aim at the moment is to build a retirement village close to the amenities and services which the members of this community know so well. So far, the association has been able to obtain a grant from the Ethnic Affairs Commission of New South Wales and is also employing a project officer whose work will help the group channel their existing resources more effectively and allow them to identify the present gaps in aged care offered to Italian Australians. With the assistance of the New South Wales Labor government and Fairfield City Council, the association has already secured a parcel of land of approximately 5Y2 acres in size adjacent to the Marconi Club. Subject to state ministerial approval, the association has also received a commitment in principle from the Department of Housing for a grant of $1.3 million-an initial contribution towards the development of the village. So the association has obviously made a successful start. It also realises that most of the money it needs will have to come through private fundraising, but it will need a great deal more assistance to get this project completed. On behalf of the association and the Italian Australian community in south-western Sydney, I call on the federal government, in particular, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), who has responsibility for nursing home grants, to give what assistance they can to help a group of Australians who are trying to help themselves and the elderly in their community. It really is an opportunity for the government to put its money where its mouth is on aged care and support the battlers of western Sydney. Its money will go some way to providing a much needed service for what is rapidly an ageing section of my constituency. There was a commitment under the previous government for funding in the event that this committee got its act together and got up and running. I am pleased to say that at that time that commitment was also in excess of $1.5 million. I have written to the minister explaining how the group has now come together, how they have formulated their policies, how they have put into practice, with the land that they have, a committee that is worthwhile and how they will be able to deliver on what they have stated. I feel sure that this government will want to contribute to assist and achieve that. Mobile Intensive Care Resuscitation",122
201,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Friday, it was a pleasure for me to attend a simulated aeromedical evacuation by an army Black Hawk helicopter at Wilsonton airport in Toowoomba. The occasion was the official handover of arguably the world's most advanced mobile intensive care resuscitation facility, or MIRF for short. It is pleasing to me that that facility has only been made possible through local commitment, local design and a lot of cooperation amongst various people. Whilst I regret that, owing to other commitin ments, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) was not able to attend, I was pleased that Brigadier Bill Mellor, who was heavily involved in the aftermath of the Black Hawk tragedy and who is the commander of the Darling Downs region of the Australian Defence Force, was able, on behalf of the minister, to accept this unit from the manufacturers. This unit is a self-contained unit housed in a composite fibre capsule. It has its own power, its own oxygen supply, its own cardiac defibrillator, a vital sign monitor and a compact suction unit. All of this would not have been possible without a partnership. That partnership involved academia, in particular, from the University of Southern Queensland in Toowoomba, industry-and, as I said before, very much from local industry-and, most importantly, the third of the triad, the Australian Defence Force. I want to take this opportunity this evening to congratulate USQ staff member and army reservist Professor John Grant-Thomson, who designed this unit. John is the head of the biomedical unit in the engineering faculty at USQ. I congratulate him and his staff for the ingenuity of this design. I also want to congratulate Buchanan Advanced Composites in Toowoomba, its managing director, Norm Watt, and his predecessor, John Buchanan, for the very vital part that they played in this project. This company was the same one that was involved very successfully in the glass reinforced plastic casings in the Collins class submarines. That particular contract has now been Facility completed. Two prototypes of the MIRF have already saved lives. One was involved in Rwanda. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), having been to Rwanda, may have seen this facility in action. It was also used in transporting one of the badly injured army personnel from the Black Hawk tragedy from Townsville to Perth within four days of that tragedy. So it has already saved a number of lives. I am very pleased that eight further MIRFs are under construction and that the two prototypes will be modified, bringing 10 all for the Australian Defence Force. They will cost about $100,000 each. It would not have been possible for Buchanan Advanced Composites to complete this project were it not for $270,000 worth of defence industry capability development program funding. On behalf. of everybod-, I thank the minister for makmg that fundmg available. It will also be used in the Tandem Thrust exercise in the Shoal water Bay area next month. I hope that it will have some export potential. I understand that the Queensla?d health minister is looking very carefully at Its application in the civilian context in the state of Queensland. I want to congratulate everyone concerned with this. I hope that the MIRF goes from strength to further strength. Burke, Mr B. Family Law",123
202,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"During the heady days of t?e B-rke government, when the same sanctlmomous self-righteous members of the Labor Party Left that now attack Burke were amongst the most grovelling of sycophants, I was a constant critic of his style. There was an animosity between Burke and me that went back to the late seventies when Burke was actively opposing my preselection. Having made this clear, I feel compelled to say that the charges laid against Burke both in this present case and in the previous case are, in my view, politically motivated. For example, the disappearance of evidence that could have been crucial in Burke's defence from the office of the DPP, has never been satisfactorily explained.",124
203,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The member for Kalgoorlie is getting very close to the very sensitive issue of sub judice. I ask you to moderate your language and be very careful about what you say.,124
204,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"I am going away from it now, but you go to the heart of what is loosely called justice, Mr Speaker. In this present case, the Labor Party has never claimed it owned the money and in the trial has given evidence that it did not own the money. At that point, there should have been no case to answer. Anyone who was aware of the political situation at the time would have known that many of the donors would not have given their money to the ALP but were prepared to support a premier who was getting things done. Any fair analysis of history could not refute the point that he did get things done. The willingness of the DPP to tender hearsay evidence and the alacrity of the court in accepting it have been features of this trial. The reporting of the media has borne little relation to the actual evidence tendered. No doubt there is more media mileage in a political witch-hunt than there is in honest reporting of the facts. It is just another example of the harlot's prerogative of power without responsibility. In the few minutes remaining to me, I want to talk about one of the onerous jobs that politicians get from time to time, and that is to support little people in society who are crushed by the system and attacked by the system. I have in mind a particular case in Western Australia where a woman I know brought all the money to a marriage. When her husband left the marriage, it turned out that she got all the children and the husband got all the money. She has been remorselessly and relentlessly persecuted: After going through the transcripts of the cases that were held, it is my view that the judge in that case has an awful lot to answer for. 1 will be watching this case very carefully. However, it is quite clear that this woman has suffered abuse, has been bashed and robbed, and has been assaulted by the police. She has tendered evidence and found that nothing has been done. She has laid complaints and no action has been taken. There is no excuse for this behaviour. It has been followed up with questions in the state parliament. Because of the illness of this woman, those questions have somehow lapsed but they will be reactivated. I will be using all the power I have in parliament, and my colleagues in the state parliament in Western Australia will be doing the same. It may take a long time to get justice, but justice will be done in the end. It will not be done thanks to the courts of this nation; it will be done thanks to the politicians who are prepared to go out and fight for the rights, the personal freedom and the integrity of ordinary little people who are getting squashed by the system. Garrawarra Centre for Aged Care",124
205,Mrs VALE,ADJOURNMENT,"On the last occasion I spoke in this debate, I mentioned the crisis situation in my electorate of Hughes at the Garrawarra Centre for Aged Care. I wish to record my gratitude to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) for her time and consideration of this issue and for meeting with a delegation from the centre, including representatives of the nurses union, Hannaker Chipperfield and Christine Swinfield, and Councillor David Redmond of the Sutherland shire council. In conclusion, in addition to those issues raised, there is the issue of financing for the continuing presence of a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, a social worker and a clinical director of medical services. The cost implications of these services are around $120,000 a year, which is not secured under Camsam. In the decision making, there has been little discussion about human consequences and no recognition for the expertise developed in regard to dementia care, palliation and rehabilitation at Garrawarra. The decision appears to have been centred on the reduction in bed numbers to fit into a Commonwealth-state agreement, and I think this has led to the current impasse. If pursued to conclusion, the current decisions cannot but lead to a further reduction in the care of people with dementia and special needs. This must be addressed, particularly in regard to the Commonwealth's declaration on these issues and in view of the recent discussions concerning networks which relieve the pressure on carers whose loved ones suffer from such devastating conditions. I have received a letter from Mr Neville Maxwell, a member of Carers' Taskforce Australia, who has been the sole carer of his wife for over four years. Mrs Maxwell suffered a cardiac arrest and, consequently, permanent brain damage. Eventually, Mr Maxwell took her home from hospital and began to care for her himself, and found it impossible to live a normal life ever again. He writes: The patient requires constant monitoring. If you live on your own, you have to provide constant supervision and this becomes very wearing. The nights are interrupted and you wake up in the morning absolutely exhausted. The tiredness is ongoing. After several weeks, you notice you are not even living in your whole home. Three or four rooms become your whole world. Traffic passes on the road outside. You try to make a normal life out of a most abnormal situation. The freedom that everyone takes for granted is stripped from you. You live under 'house arrest'. You find your savings dwindling to the point that to buy the daily paper can become 'a considered decision' . You are aware of your age, and the fact you gave up work to save your loved one (though there was no alternative) and wonder what the future can hold for you if there is not proper support. If your loved one was admitted to a nursing home, it would cost the government $1000 per week or more. Yet to keep them at home is almost to guarantee your own financial destruction. You may save the government $1000 a week, plus resources and infrastructure, but you receive a domiciliary nursing care benefit of $28.00 per week, and in some instances are treated like 'the enemy'. I maintain a 'one bed nursing home' which offers security, care and rehabilitation yet I feel I am discriminated against. In our home environment, my wife is making progress which I am told defies the odds. Carers are numbed by the tasks of today. Long term plans hold little joy. Carers need help and they need it now. The caring role brings with it isolation and loneliness and a feeling of being ignored. The reward is in the condition of the person you are caring for and such improvements as are achieved. When a loved one dies, you grieve and then slowly rebuild your life. But when a loved one is disabled, you are remind daily of what has been lost. Carers do not ask for pity. Carers are entitled to proper support. Much of the funding allocated for carers is not getting through. This is a matter which must urgently be addressed. It is personally distressing to be told 'there is no money' and then see money being spent on a self-supporting administration. The government should acknowledge that carers are saving the nation some $8 billion a year. The Carers' Taskforce Australia is a group run by carers who daily live the challenge and it is these people who can provide practical advice when setting policies. Many carers are not eligible for a pension or any other benefit. Those who do are entitled to a living wage. They are on call 168 hours per week for which they may get the precious $28.00. Not all caring is the same, to ignore the needs of those who provide full time care to a high needs patient is a serious social injustice. Prisoners better treatment. This is only one plea for help, and only one of many that I have received over the last 12 months. There is a very real and urgent need in the community for quality aged care. It is essential that the Garrawarra Centre for Aged Care in my electorate be maintained to contribute to the care of those who are the most vulnerable in our community. Education: High Schools  register tonight my total disgust with the Daily Telegraph for publishing its photograph of the HSC students of the Mount Druitt High School; it has gained some notoriety in New South Wales. As the state member for Mount Druitt, Richard Amery, has said on a number of occasions, if these students had been charged with a serious criminal offence, the law would have prevented their photograph from being published. But their photograph was published in the Daily Telegraph and they were labelled failures. Indeed, it was just another put-down for kids in my area. But as distressing as this has been for the students-and I empathise with them-and, indeed, the school and the whole community, I feel that we ought to try to tum this terribly negative episode into a community positive. However, I will take some time to establish the way in which we should do it. The very first subcommittee I ever chaired in this place was an education, employment and training subcommittee looking into years 11 and 12. We produced a report called The restless years. Amongst the recommendations we put in that report was an advocacy of senior high schools-or colleges, as they are known in some of the states. I must say that I was very privileged after the tabling of the report to address the first ever conference on senior high schools. I always have remained committed to the concept. Indeed, back in 1987 Richard Amery and I fought a local campaign to establish a senior high school for Mount Druitt-that is, a school dedicated to year 11 and 12 students, with the other five high schools being feeder high schools with years 7 to 10. It is a matter get of extreme regret to me that it was a Labor state government and a Labor state minister who finally pulled the plug on this proposal, after outstanding community, parent and student support. But to its credit, the incoming Liberal government established the St Marys Senior High School-the first ever public senior high school in New South Wales. It did not have feeder high schools. At that time. I was pleased to get a senior high school, but I was disappointed because it was suggested that eventually it would become an elite institution. Whilst initially struggling for students, now St Marys Senior High School can pick and choose-and I think something like 23 of its students came within the top 5,000 in the state. This senior high school has reversed the trend of students drifting from public schools to private schools-we have had a drift of private school students back to public. I say to the House that it remains a deep regret of mine that, had we been successful back then in a Mount Druitt senior high school, we would never have had that photograph which was published by the Daily Telegraph. I think it is entirely appropriate that the issue of a senior high school for Mount Druitt with feeder schools be back on the agenda, and I have certainly placed it there. It would correct the structural disadvantage existing high schools suffer of having most of their best students siphoned off to technological high schools, St Marys senior high and other elite schools. And we do need to do something to correct that structural disadvantage. But it has enormous benefits. The class sizes would be increased dramatically. Subject choice for students would be very real. There would be competition within the classes. Of course, the great advantage of senior high schools is that they treat their students as adults. They are a good halfway house between the total freedom and responsibility of work and university, and the rigid discipline associated with junior high schools. I remain committed to fighting for a senior high school. I certainly hope that the New South Wales state Labor government will not back out of the issue. I am particularly concerned to ensure that the inquiry into the results of Mt Druitt High, ordered by the state minister for education, receives wide publicity in my electorate. I hope that it allows the community-not just the parents of the affected students, not just the teachers in the affected high school, and not just the principal, but the whole community-to participate and comment on the recommendations. I am very confident that the community will come up with solutions for our students. Last but not least, I have to say that the young people in my electorate are, I believe, as bright as if not brighter than students from any other electorate in Australia. Toxic Shock Syndrome",125
206,Mr ENTSCH,ADJOURNMENT,"Leichhardt) (10.55 p.m.)Tonight I rise to bring to the attention of the House a coronial inquiry currently taking place in Brisbane; this is the third coronial inquest into the death of a 13-year-old child by the name of Peta-Ann Devine, who died tragically in Mr Isa on 30 November 1994. A third inquest is unprecedented in AustralI Ian history and has been brought about through a David and Goliath battle by PetaAnn's parents. It is a culmination of effort by Shirley and David Devine to get answers to the question of why their apparently perfectly healthy 13-year-old teenage daughter suddenly, in the midst of a school swimming carnival, had something go wrong in her body and, by the time she was pulled from the water, was clinically dead. An autopsy performed 26 hours after her death recorded that Peta-Ann had died of toxic shock syndrome caused, it was claimed, by a tampon which she wore that day. Whilst the findings have been disputed by representatives of the multinational manufacturers in the two previous inquests, I hope that the third inquest currently taking place will give some satisfaction to the aggrieved parents of this teenager. As a direct result of that tragedy, the previous federal government, on 20 May 1995, modified legislation in Therapeutic Goods Order 51 pertaining to, among other things, identification and health risks on tampon packaging. Some of these modifications were as follows: Section 10.1 PRIMARY PACKS: Primary Packs shall be permanently and legibly marked with the following information: (c) A warning in letters with the word IMPORTANT in capitals, as follows: IMPORTANT. Tampon use has been associated with Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). TSS is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. Read and keep the enclosed information. In another section with regard to the information leaflet inside the packaging, it says: INFORMATION LEAFLET: A leaflet containing the following information shall be enclosed in each primary pack with the second paragraph being deleted from saying: It is very rare but can be serious and replaced with It is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. The modifications were to commence to operate: Firstly in relation to menstrual tampons that are already being supplied in Australia on the date of the making of this Order-l December 1995, and In relation to all other menstrual tampons-from I July 1995. This order was dated the 29th of May 1995. have taken an interest in this case for some time. The announcement of the third inquest prompted me to check to see to what extent Therapeutic Goods Order 51 had been adhered to. To my surprise, I was able to purchase five separate brands from three different outlets, one brand being the Carefree brand used by Peta-Ann on the day of her death J must say that none of these brands displayt-,· the death warning. I find it difficult to comprehend that, som: 21 months after this order was implemented and 14 months after the final date for change, the product is still being sold without the death notice. While women will contiv'.e to use these products, it needs to be said that many of the tampon brands target young users. Some of these youngsters are as young as 11 and 12. I have to say that the packaging itself is quite decorative and is certainly directly aimed at attracting the eye of the young consumer. I believe that we need to have very much an informed decision being made with regard to these products. I think that these youngsters should be fully aware of the consequences of their actions. I also believe that the notice about the risk of death should be clearly visible on the tampon packaging. This could mean that at least the kids are prompted to start to ask some questions and then make an informed choice as to whether or not they will continue to use this product. In doing this, I would hope that we can avoid the incidence of tragedies like that of Peta-Ann Devine. I therefore call on all tampon manufacturers to take immediate action to have any products that do not comply with Therapeutic Goods Order 51 immediately removed from the supermarket shelves. I will certainly be discussing this with the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), and I will be looking at the possibility of forcing compliance in this area. I believe that it is something that is very serious. Given the amount of time that the companies have had to comply with the order, it is very irresponsible of them, and the outlets that market these products, to continue to do so without giving the appropriate warnings. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.59 p.m. NA The following notices were given:  That this House: (I) notes that: (a) Mr Rommel Salvadore Escalante went overboard from the Panamanian registered MY Hunter anchored 4.8 nautical miles south east of Nobby's Signal station during the night of 20 January 1997; (b) shore authorities were not notified that Mr Escalante was in the sea until 9.46 a.m. on 21 January 1997; (c) eleven Honduran and Romanian crew members alleged mistreatment by the ship's officers and non-payment of wages; (d) Mr Escalante was rescued from the sea, near death, by NSW Water Police at about 10.15 am on 21 January 1997; (e) Polembros Maritime Co.

Earnings Credit Scheme (Question No. 1236) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: Why was the earnings credit scheme abolished. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) The earnings credit scheme has not been effective in achieving its purpose of providing an incentive for DSS customers to participate in paid employment. DSS data shows that of the estimated 4 million customers who could potentially access the scheme, only 3 per cent (approximately) actually accessed their earnings credit balance over the course of a year. (b) The earnings credit scheme did assist people who undertook occasional casual work. However, there was a substantial group participating in regular casual or part time employment for whom the earnings credit scheme held little value. Where the person's regular earnings exceeded the income free area of $30 per week, no accrual of an earnings credit balance would occur. (c) The major incentive for DSS customers to participate in paid employment operates through the allowance income test. The more generous allowance income test tapers, which were introduced in State Number Western Australia 9206 South Australia 8474 Tasmania 3050 july 1995, mean that people are always better off working despite the removal of the earnings credit scheme. The current income test is a more equitable arrangement which provides a better incentive to work for DSS customers due to its less complicated nature and generous taper provisions. Pension Concession Cards (Question No. 1237) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice on 4 February 1997: (1) Did the Minister's Department fail to distribute 1997 Pensioner Concession Cards to thousands of pensioners throughout Australia on time; if so, (a) why, (b) what steps did the Minister's Department take to inform Pensioner Concession Cardholders of the delay in sending them updated cards and (c) how many pensioners were affected in (i) each State or Territory and (ii) the postcode areas of (A) 2145, (B) 2161, (C) 2163, (D) 2164, (E) 2165 and (F) 2176. (2) Did the Minister receive complaints from Membersand departmental staff regarding the inconvenience caused to affected pensioners. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. Approximately 98,000 pensioners were not initially included in the 2.6 million eligible for bulk issue of a 1997 Pensioner Concession Card. Cards for the group were not received before expiry of their 1996 card. (1)(a) The problem arose from errors in data generated by system processing and conversion faults. The data errors have been corrected and the identified faults will be rectified by March to avoid similar problems in future card issues. (1)(b) Regional offices and teleservice centres were able to explain the situation and arrange interim vouchers for affected pensioners where necessary. In the general course of mail, the missing cards would have been received by 23 January 1997. (l)(c)(i) The number of pensioners affected in each State was: State Number New South Wales 35026 Victoria 24889 Queensland 17395 Total 98040 Figures for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are included with those for Queensland and New South Wales respectively. (ii) Data on the 98,000 people involved is not available by postcode area and would be costly to obtain. (2) The Minister received a complaint from Senator John Hogg (Queensland). The Minister's office is made aware by departmental staff of significant service problems affecting customers.
