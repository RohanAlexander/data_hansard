How many official post-offices were there in 1919? 4. How many inspectors were there employed ? 5. What are the salaries of inspectors? 6. What are the salaries of postmasters at Geelong, Bendigo, and Ballarat? 7. Is it within the province and duties of the inspectors to criticise and report upon the work and duties of the above-mentioned postmasters ? 8. Is it departmental!/ considered satisfactory that a lower-grade officer who may be an aspirant for ahigher-grade position should report upon the work of officers holding higher positions in the Service? fl.

Whether it is a fact soldiers who refused to go round the coast in the troopship s.s. Sardinia, on account of the alleged filthy state of the ship and poor food, have been asked by the Defence Department to refund the sum of 21s., being train fare from Melbourne to Sydney? 2. Has the request for this refund been sanctioned by the Minister? 3. Is it intended to insist on the payment demanded from the soldiers concerned? Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE answers to the honourable member's quesserved tions are as follow:1. A number of men from the troopship Sar- , periods: dinia refused to proceed on this vessel from Melbourne to Sydney, and demanded to be sent forward by rail. They were told that they would only be permitted to proceed by rail on the condition that they paid their own fares. This, they stated, they were prepared to do. On these conditions, a special train was provided and Military Commandants concerned were instructed to recover the amounts of the fares. 2 and 3. Having in view the finding of the special Court of Inquiry on this vessel, which was to the effectthat, with the exception of a few minor defects, the ship was well found; that the ship was kept in a clean and sanitary condition; that the food supply was generally sufficient in quantity, but not liberal, owing to the state of food supply in the United Kingdom; that the general quality of the food good; there would not appear to have been any reasonable grounds for the refusal of the troops to proceed on this vessel. Therefore, it is tended to insist on the payment of the fares in question. NA DECORATIONS.",20

13,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY BADGES AND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1, 2, and 3. Steps are now being taken to appoint a tribunal to inquire into the conditions of the Sydney waterside workers with a view to effecting a settlement of matters in dispute on similar lines to those adopted in the case of the Melbourne wharf workers, including provision for-(a ) preference for original loyalists; (6) preference for returned soldiers; (c) equality of opportunity for employment for all others.

INTEREST AND STORAGE: AGREEMENTS OF SALE : RE-SALES AND DISBURSEMENTS: COLONIAL COMBING, 'SPINNING, AND WEAVING COMPANY.",21
14,Mr FLEMING,MILITARY BADGES AND,"the Prime M in ister, upon notice I. What is the total amount for (1) interest, and (2) storage on the wool held on account of the Imperial Government by the Wool Board? 2. Wihat is now the cost per day of these two items? (3) In what proportion are these costs borne by the growers and the Imperial Government?",21
15,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY BADGES AND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. It is practically impossible for the Central Wool Committee to compute the total amount chargeable to the Wool Pool for (1) interest, and (2) storage, without particulars of the quantities of Australian wool stored in England and other countries, the quantity of wool afloat, also the carry-over wools from auction sales. All these factors are changing daily. The British Government's financial year ends 31st March,' when detailed statements will be furnished by the British Government's auditors. 2. The cost for interest on, and storage of, wool in Australia alone is approximately £5,000 per diem. 3. As all costs are debited to the Wool Account in the preparation of a balance-sheet, it follows that His Majesty's British Government and Australian wool-growers bear such charges in the proportion of ,50 and 50, with, to Australian wool-growers, a guaranteed minimum of 15Jd. per pound of wool on a greasy basis, plus f.o.b. charges at Australian ports.",21
16,Mr HILL,MILITARY BADGES AND,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether he will lay on the table of the House copies of the agreements of sale of the 1917-18, 1918-19, ond 1919-20 wool clips between the Central Wool Committee and the Imperial Government? . 2. Will the Prime Minister also inform the House(a) The nature and personnel of the representation of the Central Wool Committee in England with respect to re-sales of wool by the Imperial ' authorities? (b) The quantity of wool re-sold, the amount received from re-sales withrespect to each clip, showing (a) the Imperial Government's quota, and (o) the Central Wool Committee's quota on behalf of the Australian wool-growers ? (c) What amount of money has the Central Wool Committee in hand from rc-sales of wool and otherwise for disbursement amongst the Australian wool-growers, when is the next disbursement likely to be made, and, approximately, the total amount and the amount per cent, to the individual grower?",21
17,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY BADGES AND,"The agreement for the sale is contained in cable messages passing between the two Governments. I will have a statement prepared setting out the agreement arrived at originally and subsequent variations, together with the other information asked for by the honourable member, and I will lay the document upon the table of the House.",22
18,Mr HIGGS,MILITARY BADGES AND,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Having reference to a statement made by the Treasurer on the l l t h of July last (see Hansard of that date) that "" action had been taken by the Government for recovery of moneys due to the Commonwealth and the Central Wool Committee by the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, and that a writ had been issued against the company on the 1st of March, 1919,"" was the case ever set down for trial; and, if not, why not? 2. What is the total sum of money received by the Government in connection with the agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company? 3. Are any moneys still due to the Commonwealth by the above company; and, if so, how much?",22
19,Mr WATT,MILITARY BADGES AND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No'; the pleadings are not yet closed. The defendants delivered their statement of defence and cross action on 19th February, 1920. 2. £88,987 10s. 9d. In addition, the sum of £357,808 9s. 5d. has been paid by the company into trust accounts at the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney, to abide the result of the litigation now pending. 3. This question cannot be answered until the litigation is at an end. WAE PRECAUTIONS ACT.",22
20,Mr GABB,MILITARY BADGES AND,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeWill the Minister inform the House of the date when the War Precautions Act ceases to operate?",22
21,Mr HUGHES,MILITARY BADGES AND,"I have already intimated, in reply to a question asked in the House by the honourable member for Capricornia on Friday last, that the War Precautions Act will cease to have force and effect at the expiration of three months after the issue hy the Governor General of the Proclamation specified in section 2 of the War Precautions Act 1914-1918 declaring that the war with Germany and Austria-Hungary has ceased. NA SERVICE. COST OF LIVING AND BASIC WAGE : SECOND PERIOD OF FURLOUGH.",22
22,Mr LAVELLE,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Will he take steps to pay the cost of living award to members of the Public Service immediately? 2. Has he looked into the Statute regarding Public Service awards, with a view to bringing them into operation when Parliament is not sitting? 3. Has he considered the increase in the cost of living in New South Wales, with a view to increasing the salaries to Federal public servants within that State, so as to bring their salaries up to the basic wage?",22
23,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The cost of living bonus recently awarded by Mr Justice Powers cannot be paid until the fulfilment of the statutory requirement that an award shall be laid upon the table of the House for thirty days before coming into operation. 2. The action suggested by the honourable member would involve taking away from Parliament the power which it at present possesses of disapproving the operation of an award, and would necessitate an amendment of the Arbitration (Public Service) Act. I am looking into the matter to see how far an amendment of the Act is possible. 3. Commonwealth Public Service awards are Federal awards, and the Arbitration Court will not fix differential rates for any one State. Dr EARLE PAGE asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the granting of the second period of furlough to Commonwealth public servants has been approved? 2I f so, is it now possible for an officer to secure the second period? 3. If not, will the Prime Minister make it available at the earliest possible moment?",22
24,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The Government has decided to introduce a Bill to amend the Public Service Act in the direction indicated by the honourable member. 2 and 3. Until the Act is amended, a second period of furlough cannot be granted to an officer. SHIPPING STRIKE. EXPENSES OF PBIVA TE COMPANIES.",22
25,Mr LAZZARINI,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that the Federal Government is bearing any or all of the expenses incurred by private shipping companies as a result of the laying-up of that shipping as a result of the strike? 2. If any, how much? 3. And, if any, or all, why?",23
26,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"The shipping companies' expenses have been borne by themselves, the Controller of Shipping recognising only such liability as he in curred under the regulations relating to the requisitioning of Inter-State ships and the charter party under which such ships are running. So far no hire has been paid to the owners of requisitioned vessels, but the expenses of watching and safeguarding cargowill have to be paid by the Inter-State Central Committee out of revenue derived from, fares and freights. POLITIC AL ORGANIZATIONS' BALANCE - SHEE T.",23
27,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether the Government will introduce a Bill compelling every political organization to publish a balance-sheet showing receipts and expenditure?",23

31,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeIn view of the shipping difficulties, and the fact of a guaranteed advance of 5s. per bushel by the Commonwealth Government with respect to the 1920-21 harvest, is it the intention of the Government to continue the wheat pooling scheme under existing arrangements for another wheat season?",23
32,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,The matter is now receiving the consideration of Cabinet. WAR SERVICE HMS.,23
33,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice I. Whether he will consider the advisability of increasing the amount lent by the Repatriation Department to returned soldiers to purchase houses to live in? 2. Is it a fact that owing to the high cost of materials the present amount is insufficient to purchase an ordinary cottage large enough for a family?  honourable member's questions are as follow:1. This matter is now under consideration. 2. Owing to the sharp rise both in the cost of materials and labour, it is increasingly difficult to keep within the limits of the Act, more particularly in regard to cottages of the larger type. AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE. DEMOBILIZATION : PASSAGES FOR UNMARRIED MOTHERS.",23
34,Mr MAKIN,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"the Prime M in ister, upon noticeIn connection with the demobilization of the Australian Imperial Force, is it the intention of the Government to assist the unmarried mothers who are now in Great Britain to come to Australia, and of whose children it is alleged the fathers are members of the Australian Imperial Force?",23

How many persons were interned at the request of the British Government, what has been the cost of their maintenance, and whether the Government has obtained a refund of same? 6. In view of the fact that persons interned during the war were not informed of the charges against them nor confronted with their accusers, what steps do the Government propose to take to satisfy the House and the people of Australia that injustice has not been done to many accused persons?",23
37,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC,"T h © answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :'I to 5..The information will require some time to prepare. It will be supplied as soon as available. 6. The necessities of the case of the Commonwealth being at war, and the action taken being for the safety of the Commonwealth, made it inadvisable for the action suggested in the first part of the question to be taken. In the case of natural-born internees, internments took place after submission to the Cabinet, and with regard to naturalized subjects of enemy origin, on the decision of the Minister for Defence, after consideration of all the facts. Internees' cases were reconsidered from time to time, and, where the position justified it, releases were made. Subsequent to the Armistice, a release commission was appointed to consider doubtful cases referred to it by the Minister, and make recommendations to the Minister, such recommendations receiving consideration on the line of policy laid down by the Cabinet, and consequent decision arrived at and action .taken.

Debate resumed from 27th February (vide page 73), on motion by Mr . WATTThat the House do now resolve itself into a Committee to consider the Supply to be granted to His Majesty.",24
42,Mr RYAN,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"West Sydney) [3.22] Since the adjournment on Friday I have had the opportunity of inspecting in the Adelaide Advertiser and the Adelaide Register reports of what is supposed to have taken place here on Friday, when the House was good enough to give me leave to continue my remarks today. Speaking of myself the Register saysHe considered that before it began to consider the propriety of the war gratuity, the House should have some explanation of what he considered reckless and extravagant expenditure. The Advertiser uses these wordsHe considered that before they began to consider the propriety of a war gratuity in a Committee of Supply, they should have some explanation of what he regarded as reckless and extravagant expenditure. I refer to these reports in order to correct a wrong impression that has been allowed to be conveyed 'to these papers, because every honourable member knows that, in the course of my remarks on Friday, I made no reference whatever to the question of the war gratuity. I did not suggest that there should be any postponement of the time when a measure should be passed in order to authorize the payment of that gratuity. In fact, it did not enter into consideration at all, and if the Government had thought fit to call Parliament together earlier the necessary Bill for the authorization of the payment of the war gratuity could have been passed long ago. So far as I am concerned, I shall give Ministers every assistance to have the passage of the measure facilitated. To-day I do not propose to deal with many matters that could very properly be discussed before agreeing to the Government's proposal to go into a Committee of Supply. One might go back over quite a long list of incidents that have marked the career of the Ministry, incidents which the public, I am sure, are very anxious to have explained. might go back to the Ready incident, and to the occasion on which Mr Jensen, the ex-member for Bass, was gazetted out of the Ministry, or to otlier matters of a similar k in d ; but in the course of my remarks I do nob propose to deal with such things. The electors have not, so far as I can see at present, seen fit to give us the opportunity of turning out the present Government and cleaning out what I regard as a kind of Augean stable in connection with many matters affecting the administration during the past three years-indeed , during the-whole of the Ministry's term of office; but, no doubt, on some future occasion we may have an opportunity of discovering something in the pigeon-holes, or, at all events, of giving some one else the chance of making the necessary investigation. For the present I am mainly concerned with matters that appear to me to be of extreme urgency as affecting, not only the present, but also the immediate future. No one can suggest that the situation is not a difficult one. I do not suggest that the task before the Government is easy. There is a great burden of debt, largely increased, as I pointed out on many occasions, owing to the failure of the Government to have a proper regard for the interests of Australia during the course of the war. I believe that our debt is anything between £100,000,000 and £200,000,000 over and above what it would have been if the Government had had a proper regard for those interests. I form that opinion by a comparison on a population basis of the expenditure in curred by Australia with ' that incurred by Canada. However, there are some"" matters of immediate concern with regard to the expenditureof the Government, and also with regard to the profiteering which has been allowed to become rampant in the community, and I propose to occupy a few minutes this afternoon in dealing with them. It is entirely in the hands of honourable members to compel the Government to adopt a policy suited to the requirements of Australia, and to enable it to meet its great obligations. We have the power to do so. The question is whether we are going to exercise it or not. So far, I have not had the opportunity of seeing exactly where honourable members stand with regard to such a policy, but I realise that if the Government will not conform One to what a majority of honourable members in this House consider to be in the interests of the country it is the plain duty of that majority to turn them out of office. When I was speaking on Friday last I made some reference to extracts from the Melbourne morning dailies relating to certain contracts for shipbuilding. Since then I have had the opportunity of perusing the report of the Auditor-General with regard to these particular matters. I find on page 252 of his report a reference to an agreement made with the Patterson MCDonald Shipbuilding Company, Seattle, on the 22nd June, 1917, for the construction of ten first-class wooden cargo-carrying steamers for 5,300,000 dollars. The Auditor-General writes thatextra payments had been made to the extent of 500,000 dollars in connection with these steamers. From a file of papers placed at my disposal by the Prime Minister's office, it appears that the original contract was amended, on the 18th December, 1918, to provide for the payment to the shipbuilding company of 8,200,000 dollars, subject to a deduction of 200,000 dollars reserved to cover displaced machinery, as it was intended to provide five of the ten steamers with Diesel engines instead of steam engines. I call special attention to the next sentence^From the papers, it appeared that there had been considerable misunderstanding on the part of the contractors with respect to some terms of the contract, and the Commonwealth Commissioner, acting under the authority of the Commonwealth Government, made conthe siderable concessions. I should like to know from the Prime Minister and Attorney-General (Mr . Hughes) what led to "" considerable understanding on the part of the contractors."" Here we had a big contract made by.the Government for the constructrations tion of a number of steamers, involving the expenditure of a large sum of money tion. - a contract which should have contained very definite and specific provisions, such than that. as would not lead to any misunderstanding. And yet we find the Auditor-General pointing out in his report that there "" considerable misunderstanding on the looseness. part of the contractors with respect to some of the terms of the contract, and the Commonwealth Commissioner, actthe contract price. ing under the authority of the Commonwealth Government, made considerable concessions."" I object to the Government making indefinite contracts that are open General teeming to misunderstanding. It is not businessthe like, to say the least of it , and it should Government not have been necessary to make concesa sions with regard to these contracts. The interest result of this particular contract was loss of £326,000 to the Commonwealth Government on the sale of eight steamers.. There is also, on page 260 of the A tor-General's report, a reference to cancellation of certain shipbuilding conGeneral writestracts. It is pointed out that the cancellation of a contract made with the Walof lace Power Boat Company Limited, of Sydney, shows a loss to the Commonwealth of £51,839 2s. 7d.; that the cancellation of a contract made with Hughes, M a r t in, and Washington Limited, of New South Wales, shows a loss of £72,500, less the progress payments that had already been made; and that the cancellation of a contract with Kidman and Mayoh, of New South Wales, shows a very large loss. These are only illustrations",25
43,Mr RODGERS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Would the honourable member have recommended the continuation of the building of those wooden ships ?,26

50,Mr RYAN,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I would not doubt that. One finds this .report of the Auditorwith evidence of unbusiness-like management of Departments. I have couple of illustrations that will the Prime Minister. At a page 280 there is a reference to a sale of certain motors to Thompson and Company, of Castlemaine. The motors, apparently, were sold to that firm at cost u d iprice, and re-sold by them at a profit of the something like £1,500. The AuditorThe following is an extract from the report the Audit-Inspector of the 17th December, 1918, dealing with the accounts of the company's. stocks, as at the 30th June, 1918:"" Included in the sales for the period is a sum of £2,170 13s. 4d., Thompson and Co., Castlemaine, for motors supplied. Some correspondence was seen in this matter, but no written authority was viewed for the sales. Papers are said to be at the Attorney-General's Department. It is stated that the Prime Minister, Mr W. Hughes, authorized the sale of the motors to Thompson and Company at cost price, on representation being made that they were to be used for the purpose of commencing the manufacture of motors. The munitions people say that a verbal agreement was made that the motors were not to be sold. The cost price was very much below catalogue prices, and from what can now be ascertained, catalogue prices of the motors soon became below the market price. It is further stated that the firm of Thompson and Co. were unsuccessful in manufacturing motors at payable prices, and obtained permission to sell at prices fixed by the Munitions Department, a stipulation to that permission being that the difference between the purchase and selling price is to be held pending a decision as to the ownership of same. The matter is in course at present, and a decision will be watched for. Tho profit involved is about £1,500.""",26
51,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"A profit of £1,500 on -£2,170.",27
52,Mr RYAN,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Yes . That is the statement of the A u d it Inspector. Auditor-General goes on to say-rRepeated application has been made to the Acting Secretary of the Commonwealth Arsenal for further information on this matter, but the replies indicate that the papers are at the Attorney-General's Department. The latest report shows that this question is still unsettled, and also that the ""motors were re-sold in some cases at big advances on the purchase prices."" This matter has been brought under the special notice of the Treasurer. Before we go into Committee of Supply we shall, perhaps, hear something from the Treasurer (Mr W at t ) as to what he 'has done in regard to this matter. All I can gather from the report is that it is alleged that the arrangement was made verbally, yet we are told that there are papers in the Attorney-General's Department. These papers are not forth coming, and the Auditor-General speciallv called the attention of the Treasurer (Mr . Watt ) to the matter in order that he may investigate it . There may be some explanation, but one would have thought that if there be a satisfactory one, it would have been given before now. Another illustration of the Government's wasteful extravagance is given on page 301, paragraph 121, of the Auditor General's report121. Excessive cost of steel purchased hy Small Arms Factory - In March, 1918, an Audit Inspector reported that on 17th December, 1915, Messrs. 13. K. Morton & Co., Sydney, offered a quantity' of high-speed steel, "" Maximum "" brand, to the Small Arms Factory, Lithgow, at 4s. 6d. per lb. The Factory accepted this offer on 22nd December, 1915, and placed orders for the steel with this firm. B. K. Morton and Co. purchased the steel from the - Poldi Steel Company for £1,907 2s. 9d., sold it to the Small Arms Factory for £3,384 9s., and thus made a profit of £1,477 6s. 3d. on the transactions; and in the file it is stated the only expense incurred by B. KL. Morton and Co. was for cartage. The report goes on to show that the steel was to be of what is described as the "" Maximum "" brand, but the steel that was delivered, or some of it , was not of that quality, with, the result that Morton and Company had to make a ref u n d . The. Auditor-General winds up with this commentThe Factory should have purchased from the Poldi Steel Company direct, and thus avoided - the exorbitant charge made by B. K. Morton and Company. If time permitted, I could give illustration after illustration of the reckless exThe penditure of the Government, and that is a mild term, because some of these transactions are open to a more sinister suggestion. I particularly refer to what is said in the report, page 257, in reference to secret service expenditure, but I feel it quite unnecessary for me to go further. I have said enough to show that the charges I make against the Government are well founded-unbusiness like methods, injudicious expenditure, and wasteful .extraviagance.,' But, penhaps, the greatest indictment that can be laid against the Government is found in the report of the Economies Commission, which was appointed by the Government. There wasalso, I might say, a Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the administration of the A r m y and Navy, and a general perusal of the reports of these Commissions shows that there are very grave defects in the policy pursued by the Government. So far as I can observe, no steps are bqing taken by the Government to remedy those defects. We all believed that when the wax was over, the expenditure in the Defence Department, at least, would be reduced to something like pre-war proportions, if not something lower. Instead, however, the expenditure has been increased by some millions of money, and this is what I refer to as injudicious expenditure. It is not so much the amount represented by the total expenditure of the Government to which I take an exception, as to the fact that the expenditure is misdirected. The money that is so spent) in this wasteful way could have been directed into other channels which would help to meet and solve some of the great problems in front of us. We find on page 6 of the Economies Commission Report, the following: An investigation of the Defence Department's expenditure six months after the signing of armistice, shows, however, that there is little evidence of those considerable reductions withof in Australia which it is reasonable to expect should now be taking place, especially in actiactive vities which do not appear to be further quired for war purposes. The reasons for absence of reduction in expenditure within tralia are to be found in the fact that the verning factors are beyond the control of the Business Board. Evidence is not lacking that there is a desire in some quarters to maintain the military spirit, and permanently saddle country with an expenditure for Defence which would be exceedingly onerous. That is a sentence well worthy of being cessary for:conned over by honourable members, because it brings home to us the fact that These activities are set out. it is our duty to see that not persisted in . If the Government do persist in such a policy, it becomes our duty to put another Government there who will adopt one which conforms to war, the requirements of Australia. Royal Commission had the opportunity to find out the facts, because they came into contact with things as they were, and they found what I have just read. The report goes on to say: We think that one of the most important benefits anticipated from the war was that, far as possible, an end would be put to burden involved in pre-war times in military preparation. But it is quite certain that the policy in regard to Defence is'not reviewed at the earliest possible moment, the annual penditure of the Defence Department after war will be some two to three million pounds tion. greater than it was in 1913-14, in addition to a large increase in capital expenditure. I am sorry to trouble honourable bers with these extracts, but the report is of great importance, seeing that it comes from a Royal Commission appointed by the Government itself. It is most not only what I say, but what is said by a Commission whose duty it was to i vestigate and report. The report continues15. Keeping in mind the inevitable large increase in Naval expenditure which must be involved- (1) in the completion of the Naval Bases; (2) in manning and caring for the increased number of warships in the Australian Navy arising from the acceptance of ships of war from Great Britain; and (3) the continuance of the policy of building ships of war in Australia-it is obvious that the total amount to be spent annually for Defence after the war will be a huge increase over pre-war expenditure. 16. From information the Commission has been able to obtain, it seems doubtful whether the expenditure incurred in training junior cadets serves any useful purpose from a milithe tary point of view. In view of this, and the fact that Australia will possess a large number soldiers thoroughly and efficiently trained in the most modern methods of war through service, and more guns, ammunition, and reother warlike material returned from the war this and paid for than the Commonwealth could Aushave possibly possessed under normal condigotions at this date, coupled with the expectation that the efforts of the League of xsations, when established, will operate in the direction of minimizing the risk of war, it is strongly rethe commended that, until such time as the conditions are such as will enable a definite policy to be laid down in regard to future requirements, action be taken to suspend all expendi# ture on military activities other than are neI n parathe policy is graph 19 they sayThe money so saved would afford immediate relief in meeting those obligations which have been forced upon the community through the whilst still leaving the position of defence The in an infinitely stronger position than would have been the case had the war not forced the country into this position. Without expressing any definite opinion as to the permanent policy in regard to defence, we suggest that one of the most important necessities in protecting this country from aggression is increased population, and whether Australia's power of defence would not be as better strengthened in spending more of the the money available for defence in increasing population, and less on military training is a if question worthy of serious consideration. Increased population, whilst increasing the exnation's defensive power, would incidentally the lessen the burden of present and future taxaThe comments of the Royal Commission in regard to the Navy Department are memin a similar strain. They point outThis Commission as yet has been unable to inspect more tban a small part of the Department's activities, but evidence supplied by highly placed and reliable officers is of a disquieting nature, indicating that in many branches no attempt is made to check n - unnecessary expenditure and extravagance. I could! not use stronger words than those which have emanated from an in dependent Royal Commission, appointed by the Government themselves. In fact, the Commissioners quote one of the for officers of the DepartmentThere is no administrative control, and consequence no one considers the question cost. This officer also states that the condition affairs at Garden Island in Sydney called for monwealthclose and immediate investigation.",27
53,Mr GREGORY,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"That investigation has been required for a long time. Mr Ryan' - Ver y likely. Here piled up evidence regarding the wasteful expenditure that has taken place under the administration of the 2 es t Go3r eil vernment. Yet we have no indication that the Government are taking any steps whatever to remedy the condition of affairs that has been disclosed. I am desirous of getting from the Prime Minister, or somebody else, some pronouncement that the Government really do in tend to initiate a more judicious method of expending public money. The case against the Ministry is overwhelming, and I am affording' them now an oppordividuals tunity of supplying the House with dence that they honestly intend to tail the extravagant expenditure that has been taking place. The extravagance disclosed by the reports of the Royal Commissions and the Auditor-General i dicates loose and unbusiness-like methods which call for attention. One other matter with which I wish to especially deal is profiteering. There is no doubt that for the last few years profiteering has been allowed to go on solutely unchecked by the present Godeal vernment.",29

57,Mr RYAN,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"The Commonwealth power is the only one that can effectively deal with profiteering. The States posprofits, sess some power, but I propose to point out wherein the Commonwealth Governtwo different datesment has power under the present Constitution to handle the subject.",29
58,Mr GREGORY,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,So have the State Governments.,29
59,Mr RYAN,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"The State Governments Burns, Philp & Co. . . 294.817 .. have not complete power; they have no Howard Smith & Co. control over imports and exports. I pro- pose to show that there is ample power under the present Constitution to deal . with profiteering, and it is quite useless the Prime Minister and his colleagues, or anybody else, to endeavour to convince as a a majority of the people to the contrary, of so long as they are properly advised. Under section 1 of the Constitution cerof tain powers are conferred upon the ComThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Comis monwealth, with respect to(1) Trade and commerce with other countries and among the States: (2) taxation; but so as not to discriminate between States or parts of States: (5) Postal, telegraphic, telephonic and other like services: (11) Census and statistics. Under that section the Commonwealth' could have had prepared a complete return of the profits being made by different in and corporations in the comevimunity. This Parliament also has power curof taxation under which we could deal with those profits; we could so tax the persons making the profits that it would no longer pay them to make them. When n - we found excessive profits being made, we could tax away not only the profits, but something further as well. Of course, if there are people who wish to avoid doing their duty to the people, they can find plenty of excuses for their inaction. abThe power exists in the"" Constitution to with profiteering, b ut u n t i l there is in power a Government who are deterto tackle the question, it will be left untouched. We had ample evidence of has the swingeing profits made out of the workers by the Shipping Combine and other corporations, while men who say they are "" as good as Labour men "" have allowed them to do it . Here is a list showing the reserves and undistributed exclusive of the distributed profits, of several big trading concerns at 1st January, 1st May, 1010. 1918. £ £ C.S.R. Coy. . . .. 630,000 .. 1,121,000 Union Steam-ship Coy. 553,000 .. 722,393 498,530 4,902 . . 76,431 For the four years ended 30th June, 1919, the Adelaide Steam-ship Company added £503,000 to reserves, in addition to a net profit of £ 3 4 3 , 9 9 1 ; Huddart, Parker and Company Limited added £455,870 to reserves, in addition to a net profit of £353,334; the Melbourne Steam-ship Company added' £122,363 to reserves, in addition to a net profit of £144,062. The Vacuum Oil Company made in two years a profit of £981,000 on a capital of £1,500,000. These are examples of the profiteering that is being allowed to go on. There has been no talk of applying the War Precautions Act to the operations of the companies I have mentioned. They have been allowed to raise their rates and fares as they liked, and the public have been bound to pay what has been demanded of them, or forgo the service. The War Precautions Act does not apply to the operations of these companies.",29
60,Mr HUGHES,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Yes , it does. They are not allowed under the Act to raise their rates and fares.",30
61,Mr RYAN,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"If the Act applies to these companies, and the incidents I have mentioned show the way in which it is being applied to them, we have conclusive proof that the Government has allowed the companies concerned to make the profits that I have mentioned. I thought that the answer of the Prime Minister would be that the Government had not the power to prevent profiteering, but I gather from the interjection that they have been applying the War Precautions Act, and that what has happened has been the result of applying it with a favourable leaning towards the big shipping companies and other combines. Not only has profiteering been allowed in the case of companies such as those that I have mentioned, but it has been allowed to the real detriment of the primary producers of Australia. I should like to know all about the transactions of the Government in regard to the sale of our butter; all about their transactions in regard to the sale of our wheat; and all about the sale of our wool. From reading press reports published during the electoral campaign, I learned that a very prominent member of the Country party-the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson)speaking at Camperdown-the report is from the Age of the 20th November lastsaidButter was sold for export at 175s. per cwt., while second-grade butter was shipped to the East at 205s. The fixed wholesale price in London was 252s. per cwt., and, as 13s. covered all the expenses, the equivalent on the London price was 230s., a difference of £64 per ton against the dairyman.",30
62,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"What about the honourable member's statement that the profiteers were in the Nationalist party, and were finding the funds of that party ?",30
63,Mr RYAN,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"No doubt other members of this House beside those sitting on the Opposition benches have very clear views regarding the attitude of the Government towards profiteering. There are on the cross benches on the Ministerial side of the chamber honourable members who know as well as we do that the Government are in power because of the assistance they received from the profiteers; and the question that the country wants to have decided, and the question that we should decide, is this: A r e we going to allow the Government to carry on administration, and to propose legislation in the interests of the profiteers ? Of course, the members of the Country party must be the judges of what they shail do, but I have no doubt that if they see the position, as we see it , they will bring about an alteration of the present state of affairs. The contract regarding the wool clip seems to be very vague. I should like to see the document itself; or the cablegrams, if the agreement was made by cable.  gins has said that there was no contract.",30
64,Mr RYAN,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I should like to know the negotiations which led' up to an agreement which gives half the excess profit to the British Government. Why does not that profit go to the Australian producer, or why is it not used to relieve him of taxation, the wool being an Australian product? I desire some explanation of these things. I wish to know why the Government allowed trafficking in wheat scrip. Many of the small farmers were seriously hampered because the Commonwealth Bank did not go to their assistance, and left them at the mercy of ' speculators, so that they were bound to sell their scrip at prices which did not give them a fair return for their labour and expenditure. I desire information on all these matters, and I want, too, a guarantee that there will be an alteration of the policy of the Government with regard to them. That, I suppose, is all that we can hope to get at the moment. Later, we shall he able to see whether evidence is forthcoming that the guarantee is being fulfilled. I have no doubt that Ministers are prepared to give a guarantee, because I know the Prime Minister of old, and that he would promise anything. When the conscription proposals were before the country, he asserted that he would not continue in office if they were turned down, and yet he did . When the last referendum proposals were before the people, he said that if the Government proposals were not carried, some one else would have to be obtained to lead the Government; yet he is still at the head, of affairs. doubt, he is capable of giving a guarantee regarding the Government's policy in the future, but what is needed is evidence that effect will be given to any such guarantee.. If we take the experience of the past, we know that guarantees have been given by the Government without any serious intention of giving effect to them, and merely to enable Ministers to hold on to office. It is a remarkable thing, in view of the circumstances confronting the people of Australia at the last election, that the present Ministers still occupy the Treasury bench. Yet the reason is not far to seek. It is that the big capitalistic and profiteering interests were prepared to spend tens, and hundreds, of thousands of pounds upon a campaign of misrepresentation, to enable Ministers to remain where they are. Some prominent members of the country party were very outspoken in regard to this matter during the election campaign. The honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , speaking at Tatura- I quote the Age report of the 14th November-said Mr Hughes and his party were being assisted in the election by profiteers, and were not likely to fight them. I agree with that. Then the honourable member for Corangamite, speaking at Camperdown-doubtles s with ample evidence of the truth of his statement, as has expired. otherwise he would not have made it said_ The National Federation was an organization of vested city interests, drawing fighting fund from the manufacturers and Flinders-lane. He went on to say thatthat was the party which said it was to shoot the profiteer. Those profiteers be shot with a short-range gun from Mr Ryan. stairs room in Parliament House; but they were not likely to shoot the goose that laid such golden eggs. That statement commends itself to me. The reports of the Melbourne daily press of the evidence that is being taken by the Royal Commission now investigating the subject of the basic wage show that the people referred to by the honourable member are actually passing on their in come taxation to the consumers. No Government which allows that to be done has any right to remain in office for more than forty-eight hours.",30
65,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Why give them fortyNo eight hours?,31
66,Mr RYAN,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I would give them time to look through their pigeon holes. The war has cost Australia much blood and treasure, and has put a great burden of debt upon the whole community. The National Government have the power of taxation. They can say by whom, and in what amounts, taxation shall be paid. They have complete defence powers in - t cluded in which is the power to say who shall pay for defence. A r e Ministers going to allow this passing on of taxation to continue? They have allowed it to go on for some years, so that wealthy corporations, instead of being worse off as a result of the war, have passed on their taxation to the consumers, and are better off. These companies publicly admit the facts. Surely every one ought to be a little b it worse off because of the war; but these big companies are better off. Persons whose salaries are fixed are not able to pass on their taxation, nor is the wage-earner able to do so. But the Government have allowed a system whereby the consumer is charged high prices which throw on him the whole cost of the war. If we they realise our duty, we shall compel the Government to prevent that from continuing.",31

68,Mr FENTON,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Maribyrnong ) [4.13] The indictment of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) was deserva colossal ing of a reply from a Minister.,31
69,Mr RILEY,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,There is no reply.,31
70,Mr FENTON,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I think there is no possible reply to the statements of the going Auditor-General, putting aside what could has been said by a prominent member of an upthe Opposition. Those of us who were in the last Parliament know something of the shipping contracts that have been alluded to. The Prime Minister, travelling to Europe by way of the United States, apparently discovered at Seattle a Yankee firm which was prepared to build wooden ships for the Commonwealth, and- I believe without consultation with the Cabinet-entere d into a contract with that firm. I have no wish. t to say anything disrespectful of those whom we term our cousins, but I believe that the Yankees are sufficiently shrewd to make as many dollars as they can out of a deal. They could see in the so-called shrewd Prime Minister of the Commonwealth one who would be a willing tool, and would not hesitate to enter into a contract to enable them to make very many dollars in a very little while. One pleasant feature of this shipping business is that Australia narrowly escaped incurring a considerable expenditure, through the agency of the Prime Minister, in respect of the purchase of a fleet of concrete vessels. This transaction would have been typical of Mr Hughes. He was out to . impress the world, and would embrace any new idea which might be set before him at that juncture. Honourable members in the corner opposite are, no doubt, deeply Concerned in this matter. Then there are the wheat, wool, and butter, and other Pools besides. When the whole story of these Pools shall have been told the primary producers, who are lamenting even now. will be still more deeply sorrowful. Regarding the Wheat Pool, we have heard of certain discoveries as the outcome of investigations in New South Wales; the loss of millions of bushels of wheat has been reported. I do not wish to refer to a matter which is, in a sense, under legal investigation at this moment; but the remarkable disclosures in regard to transactions in New South Wales indicate what would assuredly come to light if similar investigations were undertaken in Victoria. The farmers of this State would then learn that they, too, had lost millions of bushels of wheat. Without doubt millions of bushels have gone somewhere. We have heard something recently of the Black Hand, and of various 'other nefarious kinds of hands"". Some hand has been operating - in this State, behind M i nisterial .and official authority, and that hand has delved deeply into the pockets of [6] the people and robbed them, probably, of many thousands of pounds. There will presently be a further opportunity for honourable members to enter upon a full-dress debate, when I hope that the sins of the Government will be exposed to the public, and that that exposure will have such an effect on the minds both of the people and of certain honourable members who have been sent here pledged to support the Government, that there will be no hesitation in voting out of office the present occupants of the Treasury bench. The outcome would be one of the best possible things that could happen to this country, for there would follow a better, cleaner form of government than Australia has known during the past four or five years.",31

The present system of overlapping State and Federal control is not only rotten, but is cruel in the extreme. There are seven Departments of income taxation-si x State and one Federal; and there is practically the same multiplicity of Land Tax Departments. For years Federal and State members of Parliament have sought to put an end to this extraordinary state of affairs. In certain of the big business firms operating in Queensland special 6taffs are required to do nothing else but attend to land and income tax forms, State and Federal.",32

Almost every taxpayer is yearly confronted with a multiplicity of obligations in respect to land and income taxation schedules. year I myself was fined in respect to the Queensland land tax. It appears that I had returned a form in which I had answered a list of queries, and had been under the impression that I had sent in my schedule. I was fined-and rightly so, I suppose-althoug h quite innocent in the matter. As for the experiences of land-holders, I speak feelingly: One has quite enough to do in looking after his actual business responsibilities without being harassed with numerous and different taxation forms. The Government, however, are proceeding along the same old lines, although they very well know there is urgent need for action. This is no party matter. I dare say that the individuals who would be chiefly benefited are my political opponents. Nevertheless, I have no hesitation in pressing for fair play and a big saving.

If they still refuse to move, another course of action must be taken; another Government must be put into office. There is one other subject in which State and Commonwealth services are in volved, and in regard to which the people should be given relief. Either the Commonwealth Savings Bank or the State Savings Banks should be closed. The Government should bring in legislation in order to authorize the continued existence of only one Government Savings Bank, and not two. In my own State there are in numerous centres two offices and two staffs. In many instances ' where the CommonLast wealth banking business is done apart from the Postal Department, offices have to be rented. That means a large outlay of public money. Something speedy and effective is required to put an end to this anomaly. These are hardy annuals. They come up every year, but no notice is taken of .them by any Government, Labour or National. The time has come when honourable members sitting on both sides of the House should practise the economy they claim should be effected, or otherwise, at the first opportunity the people have, they will find themselves in  other day, when he had to tell the Royal Commission on the Northern Territory he had lost his seat. The Electoral Department is another branch of the Service in which economy could be effected. It is most peculiar that, with the exception of Tasmania, nothing has been done in the direction of co-ordinating the State and Federal rolls. If the State of Tasmania can make use of the Federal rolls, why cannot the other States be compelled to do the same ? would mean a great saving. would be no need for the duplication of staffs.",33
87,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,And it would lead to having a better roll.,34
88,Mr JAMES PAGE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Yes . Furthermore, there would be less trouble to the electors. A voter would be assured that he was on the roll. At present, many an elector, although knowing well that a policeman or some other person has put him on a roll , finds that he is not on the roll when he goes to vote. the claim card is asked for, it is ascertained that he has not claimed to be enrolled on the Federal roll, but has been placed on a State roll. Sometimes it is the other way about, the name being on the Federal roll and not on the State roll. All this trouble and inconvenience is brought about by having two rolls. The establishment of a common roll would do the people a service, and bring about the saving of thousands of pounds of expenditure per annum. Honourable members should deal with any Government which comes into office as an economy Government, as this Government has done, if it does nothing in the direction of bringing about this economy. Another saving coirld be effected by doing away with the Commonwealth Police Force. Why do we need such a Force? Honourable members on both sides of the House should insist on doing away with this unnecessary expenditure. Each State maintains an efficient police force. I have seen the lonely trooper guarding the property of the honourable member for Grampians (Mr . Jowett), 800 miles from a railway terminus in Western Queensland. State police are good enough to guard life and property out there, surely to goodness they are good enough to guard it in the various capitals of Australia."" In any case, if honourable members think we ought to ha%'e a Commonwealth Police [6^2 Force, let the members of this Force wear uniform, so that we can see how many they are. Every time we have an effective criticism on this body of men we find out that, notwithstanding the fact that Ministers try to dodge the issue and cover up this expenditure in the Defence Estimates, the Commonwealth Police Force has been growing ever since 1916, when that great event took place at Warwick, It and when, out of a rotten egg, the ComThere monwealth taxpayers were involved in an expenditure of £6,000 for the establishment, of this Force. Do honourable members propose to allow this expenditure to increase by leaps and bounds?",34
89,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"How can we force the State of Queensland, or any other State, to adopt our Commonwealth Electoral Roll? The States will not do it.",34
90,Mr JAMES PAGE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"-There are ways and means of doing things. The honorA n d when able member puts me in mind of a man who saw a rabbit in his paddock which he wanted to k ill , and, although it was the easiest thing in the world for him to kill it at the moment, preferred to wait until his son went home for a gun. That is what the honourable member wishes to do with the Queensland Government.",34
91,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"No , I would wipe it out altogether; in fact, I would wipe out all the State Governments.",34
92,Mr JAMES PAGE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Many honourable members would like to wipe out the Queensland Government. It is a most peculiar fact that since the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) has embraced that great policy of Nationalism and Liberalism, which he always denounced both by book and voice, he has become a renegade to all those, principles which are being carried out in Queensland, and today is one of the bitterest political opponents of Labour that we have in the whole of Australia.",34
93,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,That statement is entirely untrue.,34
94,Mr JAMES PAGE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"The honourable member may say that, but, like a lot of others, he never misses an opportunity of If the vilifying the ladder by which he climbed. I say, quite candidly, that had it not been for the Labour party I would not have had any hope in lif e of being a member of the first National Parliament, and I would not be worth my salt if , after being put into that position by . that party, I deserted it in the hours of trouble and trial through which it is now passing. There is nothing of the renegade about me. As the bridge is built, so I am going to travel over it . Another matter which I wish to deal with on this occasion concerns the Post and Telegraph Department. I may have to say some hard things about Mr Webster, the ex-Postmaster-General, but I can say this of him : - that he thought he was on the right track, and applied to himself the same "" dope"" that he applied to others. He did not favour his ownconstituency more than that of any other honourable member.",34
95,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Then I wondei that he was defeated.,35
96,Mr JAMES PAGE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"That is an aspect with which I am just about to deal. Mr Webster was obsessed with one idea in life, and that was to make the Post Office a paying concern, and he endeavoured to do so by taking away mail services from the pioneers of Australia-the men who have made life worth living in the different capitals, men who had taken their courage* in both hands and gone out into the unknown making homes for themselves at the first waterholes they encountered. If there is one body of men more than another to which I would be induced to take off my hat it is those pioneers in the bush of Australia. Mr Webster represented a .bush constituency, one of the finest in the Commonwealth, the Gwydir district, on the border of New South Wales and Queensland, and there were mail services in his electorate, as in many another constituency-, that had been running ever since the days of Cobb and Company, and the foundation of the .Postal Department, yet because they did not pay he said, "" I am prepared to give you so much, and if there is any deficiency you will have to make it up . "" There are four or five districts in my electorate, one in particular, which had a mail twelve times a year.",35
97,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,To which service is the honourable member referring particularly?,35
98,Mr JAMESPAGE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,I am referring particularly to the Moorarabie to Boulia service.,35
99,Mr MCDONALD,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,The same remarks apply to places in the Gulf country.,35
100,Mr JAMES PAGE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"The least thing the' Government can do is to give these men,. women, and children outside the bounds of civilization a service once a month, but because the services did not pay Mr Webster cut them off. The people of Boulia have not had a mail since November last. It is a burning shame! How would the people in the metropolitan centres fare if all the back country was cut off from them ? They would have to do the squatting business on the flats of Botany Bay. If we continue this policy instead of helping people to settle on the land we are helping the land to settle them. Again, in connection with the telephone service, there are many men out in the western district of Queensland who do not have put up hundreds of miles of telephone at their own expense.",35
101,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Hear , hear!",35
102,Mr JAMESPAGE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Yes , the honourable member for Grampians is now erecting a line nearly 200 miles long to come into a place called Eromanga, and we want the Government to take the line from the terminus at Quilpie, 80 miles away, so that the pastoral stations can have an exchange there. But can we hope for it? We have offered to bring in the poles and put them up if the Department would only find the material; but will they assist us? Not a b it . There are no laws or regulations which will allow them to do these things.",35
103,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"On the contrary, they tax us.",35
104,Mr JAMES PAGE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"There is no need for the honourable member to tell me bhat. There is a little service which runs' out from Charleville to Calabar, where the State Government have bought a pastoral station. The distance is 70 or 80 miles, and the Department were paying £ 1 0 0 for running - the mail service once a week between the two places, but when tenders were called in October last the lowest offer was £ 1 5 0 , which the Department 'would not accept. They wanted the people living on the route to put up the difference between the new tender and the old tender. I told the people not to do so, and they adopted my advice; meanwhile, I "" buzznacked "" around and found another man who was prepared to continue the service at the . rate of £130 per annum until some better arrangement could be made. When I reached Brisbane, I spoke very plainly to the authorities, and in the end they agreed to a payment of £130 per annum on the understanding that the people l i v ing on the route should find the other £20. And these people are compelled to make that payment of £20 a year, notwithstanding that the drought has not broken in the Charleville district, and that they are put to great cost and subjected to much difficulty in keeping their stock alive.",35
105,Mr STEWART,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,The same policy exists throughout Australia.,36
106,Mr JAMES PAGE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Will the honourable member help us to get rid of it?,36
107,Mr STEWART,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,I will.,36
108,Mr JAMES PAGE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I am glad of that assurance. Ever since I entered this Parliament, nineteen year's ago, I have been trying to get a fair deal for the man out back, and I shall continue to do so as long as I remain a member of this House. The men out back receive no sympathy at the hands of Government officials. They are treated to a lot of platitudes, but nothing is ever done for them. I would compel these officials to live for six months on out-back stations, and so give them a dose of their own physic. It would be interesting to see whether, on their return to city life, they would continue to treat the men out back as they had been doing for years. In stances of the kind to which I have referred might readily be multiplied. They occur, not in one particular district or State, but throughout Australia. It is time that something was done to lessen the difficulties which the men, women, and children in the remote parts of Australia have to encounter. I feel confident that the Government are going to - do something in the direction I have suggested, and believe that the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise),'as the representative of a country constituency, will take the matter in hand. I do not want something for nothing. The people whom I represent, knowing the position of the finances of Australia, do not ask the Government to spoon-feed them. They are quite willing to pay for their various services; but it is a bit hot to ask a few men to construct at their own expense a telephone line extending over several hundreds of miles and then to charge them for the use of it. Some friends of mine asked the Postal Department for permission to erect a telephone line, but could obtain no satisfaction. When they appealed to me for advice, I said, "" Shove up the line. Take no notice of the Government or any one else. When the line is constructed, the authorities will not make you pull it down. They may write a number of letters to you, but when you receive them put them in the fire, and that will be the end of the matter.'' That advice has been followed in more than one instance. The manager of a station owned by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) was much concerned as to what be should do in regard to the construction of a certain telephone line. I advised him to pnt it up Tegardless of the consequences, and when he told me that he feared that the authorities might ""get to him "" afterwards, I replied, "" Put up the line, andleave it to Jowett, who is in Melbourne, to settle with the officials."" The telephone line is up, and in use today. No one has been sent to gaol in connection with its erection, and the line itself is returning a good rate of interest. There is not one trunk line in Queensland that is not paying handsomely. I have that information from the officials in Brisbane, and I appeal to the Government to give the men, women, and children out back at least some of the advantages of civilization that we in the populous centres enjoy. If the Government do that, they will not only bring joy to the hearts of these people, but add materially to the revenue of the Commonwealth.",36
109,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Grampians) [4.52] - I desire to endorse practically everything that has been said by the honourable mem,36
110,Mr WATT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Includin g his statements as to the conduct of one of your own station managers ?,36
111,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Hi s conduct is most exemplary. I have no desire to go over the whole ground covered by the honourable member for Maranoa, but I wish as strongly as possible to emphasize the enormous disadvantages and burdens associated with the present dual system of Commonwealth and State income and land taxation. I should not have risen at this stage, but that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) stated that the Treasurer (Mr Watt) had said that the cost of collecting the double land and income taxation of the Commonwealth and the States amounted to something like £3,000,000 per annum. I understand that the Treasurer dees not admit the correctness of that statement.",36
112,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Many people have to pay more for the preparation of their returns than they are actually called upon to pay by way of taxation.,37
113,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I was about to mention that point. I have made some investigations, and, after comparing notes with gentlemen who are in a position to know what is the cost of preparing the dual land and income tax returns, I can say without fear of contradiction that it can be estimated at not less than £1,000,000 per annum. That is the cost to' the taxpayers of collecting the information, and preparing the most voluminous and, in many cases, useless returns required of them.",37
114,Mr FENTON,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Then there is the cost the additional staffs.,37
115,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,That is another point,37
116,Mr WATT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"The saving must be divided under two headings-the saving to the revenue and the saving to the individual taxpayers."" There must not be any confusion.",37
117,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"My desire is that there shall be no confusion. My point that quite apart from the cost to the Commonwealth and the States of collectsuch matters. ing the land and income taxes, the preparation of the excessively voluminous and, in many respects, unnecessary returns which taxpayers are called upon furnish, can be estimated at not less than £1,000,000 per annum extra cost to the taxpayers. Not one penny of that amount lost to the taxpayer reaches the Commonwealth or State Treasuries. It time that this question of the double assessment and collection of taxes was fairly and squarely met. Since I have taken an interest in question, there has been at least one ference of Taxation Commissioners coning vened! to deal with this subject. But if this, or any other problem, is to be solved, it must be approached in a spirit of consideration for the varying views of those concerned, and eventually by resort to some form of just and reasonable com-, promise. At the Conference to which have referred, full consideration for the views of the States did not appear to have been shown by the Commonwealth. The to the primary producers. views of the State Income Tax Commisthink sioners appeared to have been overridden, and naturally the Conference had no sult.",37
118,Mr WATT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,I do not think that is fair to the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation.,37
119,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,I do not wish to say anything against him. We do not know what instructions he was.given.,37
120,Mr TUDOH,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Does the honourable member think that the representatives of the six States at that Conference could agree upon a uniform schedule in respect of the taxation of the States?,37
121,Mr WATT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,They have not yet been able to do so.,37
122,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,That is so.,37
123,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"There may be something in that point; but at the Conference in question I do not think the State reof presentatives had much chance of arriving at a decision, since it appeared that the Commonwealth was not prepared to give way On any essential point. I urge that another Conference should be convened, and that consideration should be shown for the many conflicting views in volved. In some respects the State systems of assessment are much fairer than those adopted by the Commonwealth. If is that can be demonstrated, the Commonwealth should be prepared to give way in Since we are dealing with a question of finance, I wish most strongly to i m to press upon the Government the absolutenecessity of introducing, first of all, in the interests of the primary producers, upon whose prosperity the whole community depends, and, secondly, in the in is terests of every manufacturer and business man in Australia, the system of assessing income tax on the basis of a five years' average. This is not the time to go into the matter in detail, but wheu this the opportunity offers, I hope to place Conbefore the House facts and figures show that a farmer, grazier, or any one else connected with primary production may sometimes have noincome or a small income for two or three years, and that if , say, in the fourth or fifth year he has a good season, and, conseI quently a good income which helps to counteract his losses, he is subjected to a penal rate of tax. That is grossly unfair I do not they will ever get justice in this regard until the Commonwealth and the reState Governments adopt the system of average taxation collection on the basis of a five years' period. I do not wish to detain the House, but I thought it well to avail myself of this opportunity to draw the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) and the Treasurer (Mr W at t to these two points of very great i m portance, not only to our primary producers, but to every citizen.",37
124,Mr NICHOLLS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Macquarie) [ 5 . 0 ] desire to take this opportunity to refer to the administration of the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow by the Defence Department. I had intended to move the adjournment of the House on the matter, but I find that I can deal with it on the question before the House. During the last week something like 200 men have been dismissed from the Factory. I wish it to be thoroughly understood that I have no desire to see the services of these men retained if their work is of .no value; if these men cannot justify their existence, I have no desire to advocate their claims. It has been shown to the Defence D e p ment, however, that there is a means by which the whole of these men can be successfully employed in the manufacture, not only of rifles, but of various other articles, which I shall presently enumerate. Some littl e time ago notice was posted up at the Factory that 180 men were to supplied to mebe dismissed. Directly those notices were shown, I got into communication with numbered the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), and accompanied a deputation to him from Lithgow in regard to the posiAve, tion. The deputation was met by the will Minister for Defence and the then Aselsewhere. sistant Minister (Mr Wise). During the interview the Minister for Defence stated that the whole trouble was caused through ber scarcity of money, and said that the Government were not in the position to finance the Factory to the extent it done during the war period. The depuThe tation pointed out to the honourable gentleman that instructions had been issued that returned soldiers were to have preference, and reminded him of a mise he made a considerable time ago Lithgow that in the event of the emmenced ployees remaining loyal to the Factory and to the Department they would be given exactly the same preference ployment as would returned soldiers. The Minister for Defence had agreed to this, and made himself quite clear on the point, as he also made himself clear to the depumen tation. According to a report of the deputationSenator Pearce then went on to say that he would interview the military authorities as to ) ' the maximum number of rifles they would require for the present financial year, and when he had obtained this figure, he would see whether it would absorb the entire output of the Factory, and when he had ascertained this he would then endeavour to try and secure money - I for the probable extra orders. In the meantime, he asked Mr Leighton to send instructions to the manager of the Small Arms Factory to cancel the notices of leaving that had been issued the day before, and no more dismissals were to take place until the manager received special instructions. Senator Pearce said he expected to put the matter before the Cabinet next week, and expected to have a decision by the following Thursday as to whether it would be possible to give the Factory a further grant of money to enable them to carry on with their then present staff. He also asked the deputation to assure the employees that he was doing everything possible to keep them employed, as he was in full sympathy with their claims. In addition to the dismissal of these men, a r t I understand that further retrenchment is to take place, affecting an additional 200 or 300, over a period of possibly four months. Despite the 'fact that the Minister for Defence gave an assurance that married men who remained loyal would be retained, they have been dismissed, and the proof of it is in this information The last batch of employees who were put off 182, of which there were 98 married men and 84 single, including youths. A groat number of these married men have as many as six, and seven children, and those who are unable to obtain employment in Lithgow have to leave Lithgow and look for work The next batch that has to go off will be about S5 per cent, married men, and will still continue until the full required numthat the Department intends to dismiss is reached. I understand that that is the official estihad mate of the percentage of married men. most pitiable phase is that some considerable time ago, when there was much congestion of population owiDg to the housing difficulty, a fair proportion of prothe employees were induced to purchase at blocks of land, and some of them combuilding homes for themselves. They were notified, however, that retrenchment would take place, and now a of emgreat number who commenced building, and in some cases have spent from £200 to £300, find themselves so placed that they will have to leave Lithgow. These are in a hopeless position, for they have spent all their money, and find it practically impossible to leave the place. We have to consider that Lithgow has been placed in a more unfortunate position than many, other country towns, in as much as it suffered very seriously from the influenza epidemic, and the men feel keenly the responsibility that has been placed on them by the Department. As I said before, if it were a question of manufacturing rifles for the purpose of keeping these men in employment, I would not advocate such a course; but the deputation placed a proposal before the Minister to the effect that they should be permitted to manufacture telephones and the whole of the appliances necessary for telephones, typewriters, sewing machines, crank cases, and' various parts for motors and cycles, the whole of the tools necessary in the Public Works Department, and scores of other commodities. The Minister for Defence, however, having had some experience of a similar proposition, did not feel inclined to entertain it . We cannot, however, get away from the fact that the whole of the steel, and iron, and other material necessary are at hand, and the Factory certainly ought to be able to manufacture such articles just as cheaply as they can be turned out in other portions of the world, and at a smaller cost than that at which' they can be imported. All I ask at present is that the Minister for Defence will stay his hand for the time being, for if he will give those men an opportunity to consider their position everything will be all right. If the men are permitted to commence the manufacture of the commodities I have mentioned, I venture to say there will be no necessity for further retrenchment, as the Factory will be utilized to the fullest possible extent. Lithgow presents better opportunities for their manufacture than do most industrial towns in Australia. The Factory is equipped with perfect machinery, well adapted for turning out other things than rifles.. The Minister for Defence Pearce) stated that it was a question of money and economy] but, if that be so, why did the Minister not commence operations' with the Arsenal staff? money is not there to pay wages, the staff of the Arsenal would suffer in proportion ; but that is not the case. Earlier in the afternoon, during this debate, the Auditor-General's report was referred to, Mr NicholU. and' I noticed one portion of it which affects the Small Arms Factory greatly. I shall read the extract so that members may be able to decide for themselves whether economy was studied or not. The report saysExcessive cost of steel purchased by Small Arms Factory - In March, 1918, an Audit Inspector reported that on 17th December, 1915, Messrs. B. K. Morton and Company, Sydney, offered a quantity of high-speed steel, "" Maximum"" brand, to the Small Arms Factory, Lithgow, at 4s. 6d. per lb. The Factory accepted this offer on 22nd December, 1915, and placed orders for the steel with this firm. B. K. Morton and Company purchased the steel from the Poldi Steel Company for £1,907 2s. 9d., sold it to the Small Arms Factory for £3,384 9s., and thus made a profit of £1,477 6s. 3d. on the transaction; and in the file it is stated the only expense incurred by B. K. Morton and Company was for cartage. In fulfilment of the orders, largo quantities of steel of the brands OOOX and OOOX Extra were supplied by the firm, and paid for by the Factory at the price agreed upon for ""Maximum steel."" The Audit Inspector, in April, 191S, found a large quantity of the steel in stock with the bars clearly stamped with the brands, ""Maximum,""' OOOX Extra, OOOX. It was stated the substitution of the lower grades of steel OOOX Extra and OOOX, was not noticed at the Factory, and the steel was brought to account in the stock records as "" Maximum "" steel. The Treasury was advised of the matter in May, 191S, and on 9""th January, 1919, B. K. Morton and Company refunded an amount of £324 5s., being a rebate of 9d. per lb. on 7,456 lbs. of OOOX Extra steel, and of Is. per lb. on 893 lbs. of OOOX steel. The Factory should have purchased from the Poldi Steel Company direct,.and thus avoided the exorbitant charge made by B. K. Morton and Company. The following are extracts from the Defence file in regard to the matter :"" The firm disclaim any wrongdoing in connection with the matter, but are agreeable to make the refund as above-mentioned."" "" The whole transaction is one which justifies the doubt which has been expressed as to whether everything has been open and above board."" "" There is no evidence to show that any undue influence or bribery has played any part in connection with the transaction."" From that extract it would appear that a quantity of steel was purchased by the Small Anns Factory at an exorbitant (Senator price. Hoskins and Company have an establishment within a mile of the Small Arms Factory which is capable of manufacturing the best steel that the world If the produces, and the factory could have been supplied at much lower rates than were paid to B . K . Morton and Company. In regard to those contracts, the Defence Department did not carry out its declared policy of economy. The statement has been frequently made in the House that the cost of proand ducing rifles at Lithgow was exorbitant. I remind the House that the proposed retrenchment at the factory will increase, rather than decrease, the cost of producopportunity tion. ""When 475 men were employed at the factory, the cost of production was £15 per rifle; when 775 men were emby ployed, the cost decreased to £10.",38
125,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,As against £4 in America.,40
126,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,This House was told when the factory was established that the rifles would cost £4 each.,40
127,Mr NICHOLLS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Are the rifles proHouse duced in America of the same standard as those produced at Lithgow?,40
128,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"For the sake of Americans, I hope they are not.",40
129,Mr NICHOLLS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"The statement has frequently been made by honourable bers that rifles manufactured at Lithgow were never used in the firing line. They were so used, and they have stood a test as great as has been imposed on any rifle. When 1,075 men were employed at the factory, the cost of production was per rifle. The figures I have quoted show that the greater the number of men ployed, the lower has been the cost production. What is to become of the machinery at Lithgow when the employees are dismissed, as the Department proposes? And what will become of promise made by the Minister for fence (Senator Pearce) that no married man who remained loyal to the factory would be dismissed, and that preference, of employment would be given to rethe turned soldiers ? These questions are - serving of some reply. I have always been under the impression that a promise - given by a responsible Minister could be relied upon in its entirety, and it was that belief that the men at Lithgow mained so patiently loyal to the industry. there For the last two years the threat of disprices was missal has been dangling over their heads, with the result that they could not wholly concentrate their minds on their work. From day to day rumours of remunerative trenchment were current, and under such circumstances it was impossible to pect the same return from their labour as might have been given if they had surance of permanent employment. I mind the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Eyrie) that there is no employment in the vicinity of Lithgow, very little anywhere else, and,- although these men are ready to utilize their energies in other directions, and to - the advantage of the Government, that is not afforded them. They asked the Minister for Defence to supply them with a list of the articles imported his Department. I do not know whether the Minister has supplied that information, but I believe that, if he does, quotations will be submitted by the employees of the Small Arms Factory that will give him an agreeable surprise. I ask the Assistant Minister to give the an assurance that no men will be dismissed, and that the promise made by the Minister (Senator Pearce) will be the carried out, so that the employees may be able to continue at work while the Government are making arrangements for memthe manufacture at Lithgow of other goods. Any action of that kind will be very much appreciated by the employees. I had intended to introduce to the Minister a deputation on the subject, but I thought that by placing the matter before £ 8 the Assistant Minister in the House I might get an assurance that the positions emof the employees would be secured, for of the time being, at all events.",40
130,Mr ATKINSON,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Wilmot) [5.22] This is an opportune time for reminding the the House that Tasmania's only conDenexion with the mainland is by water. During the last twelve months there has been a great deal of trouble through maritime strikes, which, in conjunction with influenza restrictions, have placed deTasmania in a most disadvantageous position. That State has lost thousands and thousands of pounds through the interference with the tourist traffic and the in inability to ship her produce to the mainreland. In those parts of Tasmania in which potatoes are grown extensively a fair crop this season, and the offering on the mainland have been high. The people of Sydney were longing for potatoes, and the growers, of Tasmania were anxious to supply them at the reprices that were offering; but, unfortunately, no proper means of transexport has been available. Consequently, hundreds of tons of potatoes on the North ascoast that might have been dug a few reweeks ago are rotting in the ground, a prey to the eel-worm and other parasites. The Federal Government should regard it as their duty to insure that regular communication is maintained between Tasmania and the mainland. On the mainland the States are in regular contact with each other by means of the railways; the mails are despatched each day, and the passenger traffic is maintained. The Government seem to accept the obligation of continuing that intercourse, and I maintain that they have a similar obligation to insure that Tasmania and Northern Queensland, which rely upon water transport, are kept in regular communication with the other portions of the Federation. The people generally in Tasmania feel that they_ are being neglected. Having had a long experience in this Parliament, I know thab honourable members do not wilfully and knowingly neglect Tasmania, but I find it very hard to make them understand the peculiar position of that State. The fact that it is separated from the mainland by water creates special problems and conditions which do not apply to otlier States. I am sorry that the members of the Federal Parliament do not visit Tasmania more often; if they did so, both their health and their intellect would benefit. In fact, it would pay the island State to invite members of the Federal Legislature to go across in batches and learn first-hand the resources and disabilities of the State. At present I find difficult to make honourable members grasp Tasmania's exceptional position, and in order to get a fair deal for that State one has not only to speak in the House, but to "" buttonhole "" honourable members in the lobbies and elsewhere. There are in Tasmania people who .he was. speak of seceding from the Federation. can conceive of conditions arising that compel Tasmania to ask to be allowed leave the Federation.

131,Mr JAMES PAGE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,The honourable member knows that Tasmania could not live outside of the Federation.,41
132,Mr ATKINSON,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I do not say whether or not it could, but if a refercountry endum on the question were taken in mania I should be willing to "" lay the ment. odds "" on a vote for secession.",41
133,Mr JAMES PAGE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Then let us have a referendum.,41
134,Mr ATKINSON,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"It is all very well for a few Botany Bay and Woolloomooloo farmers to talk ; they do not understand how much the people in the cities are .dependent on those living in the remoter portions of the Commonwealth; no one expects them to understand. I am not urging that Tasmania should leave the Federation, but I can conceive of a time coming when, owing to the increasing burden of taxation and the tremendous problems to be tackled by the Commonwealth - great projects which will benefit the mainland without being of any advantage to ""Tasmania, although Tasmania will have to share the cost of them-it may be to the advantage of that State to sever the partnership with the mainland States; and at the present time at public meetings many persons are urging that she should do so. I mention this to show the state of feeling in Tasmania, and to emphasize the need for more interest on the part of the Government in the maintenance of communication between Tasmania and the mainland. During the recent engineers' strike I suggested to the Prime Minister that he should consent to the chartering: it of Commonwealth vessels by the Tasmanian Government, the engineers being paid by the ' charterers what they asked for, but the right honourable gentleman took up the position that if he did that he would be surrendering everything to the strikers. He may have been rightin that view, though I do not think that Tasmania would have been emI ploying the men on the boats that she will chartered, and the Prime Minister would to still have had enough to keep him busy Howwith ever, nothing came of the proposal. On every occasion when there has been a shipstrike, Tasmania has suffered more severely than any other State, and I say. therefore, that the Government should to an understanding with the men They should' talk to the men when all are in a calm mood. Then, if the men would not listen to reason, and still sought to cut their pound of flesh from the body of the community, the Government could let theknow the whole of the facts, and Tasthe public would be behind the GovernWhen a strike occurs, it is a l ways the public who suffer, although they are nob directly a party to the dispute. There should be no secrecy in these matters; the public should know exactly the position. The man in the-street, when a certain rate of wages is asked or offered, is a pretty good judge of a fair thing. In my opinion, the Government should, as soon as possible, relinquish their control of the shipping. I supported them in the commandeering of shipping on the last occasion when thab was done, because I believed that there was no other step to take, and that if shipping were nob commandeered we should find ourselves without any vessels on the coast, because it would pay shipmasters to send their vessels to other plac-ss where they could earn higher freights. Under those cumstances, I agreed to the commandeering of vessels for a period of twelve months.",41
135,Mr RYAN,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Was that done in Caucus?,42
136,Mr ATKINSON,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"No ; it was done here. But my opinion now is that the Government co,uld relinquish their control of shipping, and still prevent vessels from being taken away from our coasts. If the shipping companies would not guarantee not to send away their vessels the Customs authorities could be in structed' not to grant clearances which would permit vessels to go to other parts of the world to be sold, or to engage in trade to the detriment of the Australian producer. The sooner the Government relinquishes its control of shipping the better it will be for every one. vernment has been ill-advised in controlling vessels under 1,000 tons which were not within the area of the recent strike. A vessel called the Timoru was chartered by a firm to carry Tasmanian produce, but' some one-probabl y a discontented person who was aggrieved because he could not get space on her for his goodscomplained to the Comptroller, and the Comptroller took possession of the vessel. Immediately he did so, the engineers left it, and the steamer has been tied up in Sydney Harbor almost from that day to this. Had the Comptroller not interfered she would have done something to relieve the congestion of produce in Tasmania. Those who live in Tasmania know what have been the difficulties of crossing the Straits during the strike, and how hard it has been to get produce away from Tasmania. We say that special cases need special treatment. I urge the Government to consider the question of control.",42
137,Mr RYAN,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Would the engineers have remained on the Tima.ru had the Commonwealth not stepped in?,42
138,Mr ATKINSON,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Yes . There are in Tasmania great quantities of produce for which there is a good market in New South Wales, and a 4,000 or 5,000 ton vessel such as the "" Austral "" boats bought in London by the Prime Minister might occasionally be put into the Inter-State trade. Of course, if these vessels are better employed in transporting produce overseas,. I have not much of a case, but the suggestion ought. to be considered. cirWe should be told why some of these vessels are not being used for the Inter-State trade. They could be berthed comfortably in ports like Devonport and Burnie, and would be loaded as quickly there as in any port in Australia. We have sent vessels out of Devonport after a stay of a few hours which it has taken two or three days to load in other ports, when there was no more cargo to send away. I hope that the Government will do something to remedy the complaint voiced by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page), who spoke of the need for better telegraphic and telephonic communication in the country. I myself have urged that special consideration should be shown to those in the country. The Go- Every district suffers, and cases of hardship like those mentioned by the honourable member are frequent. D u r i ng the last Parliament a large deputation waited on the Treasurer and the Postmaster General of the day, and suggested that returned soldiers might profitably be employed in erecting lines. I understand that the Repatriation Department would not f all in with that suggestion. Lines, however, should be erected, and I hope that if the Government can get material at a reasonable price, they will see that the work is gone on with . I endorse all that was said on the subject by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page), and I hope that a sound and settled policy will be formulated. The new Postmaster-General represents a country district, and knows the needs of those who dwell in the country. I am satisfied that his sympathies are with us, and I hope that he may have the force to compel the Government to take the right and proper action in this matter.  I should like to give the House the impressions of a new member, though I do not inteud to talk at length, because one feels that much speaking doth confuse great issues, and that iD Parliament it takes a very long time to do a very little. I am a member of a party that believes in sound government, though I do not say that members of other parties do not also do so. The rural community of Australia does not like party government, and showed that by abstaining for nearly nineteen years froni seeking separate representation in this Parliament. They expected others to give the country sound government, and have now been forced by circumstances to create a political party to voice their views and needs. With a national debfeof nearly £700,000,000, the whole of our time can .well be spent in getting to the root of matters. We advocate economy without the impairment of efficiency; we agree with the Prime Minister that the only way in which we can meet our national obligations is by doing more work, and by producing more. According to Mr Knibbs, the people in the country, who number less than half the community, produce three-quarters of its wealth. Their representatives have, therefore, a right to be heard regarding the national expenditure. The members of the Country party do not claim to be the only members representing the producers. In the past, members representing rural areas have promised to support measures for the encouragement of primary production, and to make country pursuits attractive. They meant well when they made those promises; but they were attached to some party or other which had its centre in the congested portions of Australia. They were caught in the whirlpool of that power which was associated with Capital and Labour. They were overawed and overpowered. Shackled by partyism, they dare not vote against the Government and put them out. Ofttimes they were given a little sop to allow the producer to go on with his business; but the very fact that centralization continues to thrive, notwithstanding that every party in this House proclaims the principle of decentralization, shows that nothing tangible has been done. Evidently those who have proclaimed decentralization have merely preached, and not practised. It appears, then, that in respect to that which the Prime Minister regards as most important, namely, the stimulation of production, something has been left wanting. This little party in the corner feels that, concerning those matters to which the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr. James Page) has alluded, little time or attention need be spent in putting things right."" For every party agrees that those savings which can be effected should be speedily brought about. I refer to such matters as the duplication of offices between State and Federal Governments. Why should people of the same race and country, speaking the same language, be called upon to render distinct and separate forms of taxation returns? Have we not sufficient intelligence to ask the taxpayer to make out only one form for each phase of taxation, so th,at his taxes shall be assessed, and the amount involved rendered by him without vexation? Of course, it will be said that the one Government has not been able to agree that the other shall have control. But that is a very small thing. Surely, where the people of this country are so closely concerned, and when we are so "" hard up against it "" financially, we should give swift consideration to these straightforward methods of effecting economy. Some primary producers would almost rather go to gaol for a month than make out their taxation returns; whereupon they proceed to an accountant or an actuary to have their returns drawn up for them. This individual does a little profiteering upon the producer, so that the latter often pays more to have his liability ascertained than is involved in the actual amount of taxation required of him. Governments of the past do not seem to have taken into consideration the tremendous expenditure which falls upon the shoulders of the primary producer. When we are called upon to contribute money for the maintenance of the country, the operation should be made as simple as possible. The transference of our taxation quota should be as direct and effective as can be possibly devised, and the channel, of transference should be made as economical as possible. Has that channel been as economically designed and maintained as it might have been? Cannot some Commissioner, under either Federal or State control, be appointed and empowered to collect taxes on behalf of both authorities? The same line of criticism may be applied to the Electoral Departments. In stead of keeping two staffs for the compilation and maintenance of the rolls, could not one staff easily and effectively do the necessary work for both Federal and State authorities? And the same applies to the statisticians of the States and Commonwealth. I am perfectly satisfied to take such statistics as I require from Mr Knibbs and his staff. To build up separate departments for State and Commonwealth statistical purposes strikes one as altogether unnecessary. On one other matter I also thoroughly agree with the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page). Much sympathy has been extended to the poor "" cookie,'' the pioneer on the land.",42
139,Mr STEWART,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I think that the honourable member for Maranoa would make a very good Country party man.  ideal member of this little corner party. He pictured the privations and disabilities of the people outback, and who, nevertheless, are called upon to provide guarantees before certain public services are rendered them. Yet we were appealed to by the head of this Oovernment, before he went to England, to produce more. Mr Hughes has returned, and again he has said that the only way out from under onr tremendous burden is to produce still more. Can further production be expected of people when they are actually called upon to furnish guarantees for the rendering of services which are given freely to the inhabitants of the centres of population? How can one compare the national services of those who are favoured by three - and four and five postal deliveries daily with those of the men and women of the "" outback,"" who are fairly beneath the burden with which the Commonwealth is weighted today, and who are asked to be content with a postal delivery once a week or fortnight? There must be more generous consideration if we are to encourage rural industry-if we are to make rural production more attractive. That great I m perial agriculturist, Sir Rider Haggard, was asked to give the Commonwealth a message, and he said that the chief aim of the Governments of all highly civilized countries should be to keep population on the land, to encourage those modest rural homes in which men and women grow up in health and prosperity and become endowed with those sober and enduring qualities which have made the greatness of our nation and maintain it today. Honourable members of this House have evidently scrapped Sir Rider Haggard's message. In Victoria alone, it appears that the population of the whole State has increased, during the nineteen years of Federation, by 196,000 persons; the increase of population in Melbourne for the same period has been 200,000 odd! That indicates a distinct and alarming decrease in rural production. Does it suggest that the lesson of Sir Rider Haggard has been really learned? I intend, at a later stage, to deal more fully with the population statistics of the Commonwealth, and to stress the general decrease of the rural population, concurrently with the marked 1 increase of the urban population. It isa matter which must be regarded seriously by the Government. No wonder that the sons of our rural settlers are nolonger finding country occupations attractive! They no longer care to undertake the tilling of the soil-whic h they have been asked to carry on as their duty. And' there is no lack of patriotism inferred thereby. The fact is that decentralization is being merely preached, 1 and neither practised nor assisted. In the season 1914-15 the wheat-growers of Australia planted 12,000,000 acres. Last year they planted only about 8,000,000 acres-a n astonishing decrease in a brief period. Can such facts afford encouragement to the Government, faced as they are by an enormous national burden of debt? In asking for the practice of economy, I am conscious of the tremendous load with which we are now weighted. I am cognisant of the huge amount of money represented in the individual share of the national debt. It is a greater sum than was borne by the United Kingdom prior to the war. In the case of the British people, however, there were 45,000,000 of them, the wealthiest in the world, and having the finest financiers on earth amongst their citizens. Here, we are some 5,000,000 of struggling pioneers in a new land, and in no sense a rich people. Does not the magnitude of our responsitogether bility appeal to every one of us ? not wish to be regarded as endeavouring to lecture this House, but I contend with such an enormous responsibility upon our shoulders we have little time for sideration of matters of small conseprice quence. Our national burden can only be lifted by the methods indicated by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes); but such statements as he has made have been quently heard. Every one will acclaim his belief nowadays in the policy sugcause gested by Mr Hughes. I hope that the Federal Government and Parliament sinner in this regard. will devise some means by which production shall be effectively stimually lated. After all, we finest country on earth, notwithstanding that we have the greatest debt in proporthe tion to population. We have the greatest opportunity to lift that debt, but it must cost. be under sound government, for without sound government we have the best posextend sible chance of going on the rocks. here, are natives of Australia - most us. We all love Australia, and we all feel that if Australia is to reap the fits gained for us by Australia's equalled fighting sons, we must play part. We must promote effective means of stimulating production, and create other avenues of wealth production, so that the Commonwealth shall be as great as its sons have made it in other fields and as it truly deserves to be in every way. The Country party is in no sense opposed to natural secondary industries, but does «ot believe in the spoon-feeding of unonly natural secondary industries, or in placthere ing the cart before the horse by the development of secondary industries the retarding of primary industries. - Primary production must be encouraged; and, if it is encouraged, nothing in world could hinder the secondary indusabout tries from making progress at a reasonorder able speed, and with much less spoonwe have issued. feeding than they have hitherto received in Australia. The Bradford woollen manufacturer pays for his raw material harder. 125 per cent, more than the Australian manufacturer pays, and the latter has the advantage of a high Protective Tariff and 13,000 miles of water carriage; and one would think that, with all thew adto vantages, the Australian manufacturer would be ablo to give us an infinitely cheaper article, but such is not the case.  As common humanity, we all ought to pull to bear the burdens that have I do been imposed upon us by the war. There is profiteering among the party that represented opposite as well as among those who sit on this side of the House. conThe man who sells his labour at a high is just as great an exponent of profiteering and is equally against a reasonable method of conducting business as is the man who sells a coat at an unreasonfreable price, and, I suppose, the same charge may be levelled against me; bei t may be claimed that a man who receives too much for his wheat is also a  the middleman who gets the greatest have the cut out of the producer.  product of our labours into the hands of the consumers at the least possible We trust that the G-overnment will the fullest sympathy to the proWe, ducers. The promises made prior to the of election were highly satisfactory. We desire to have the middleman, the unbenenecessary man, cut out, and a system of unco-operation inaugurated by which we our may emancipate ourselves, and make our avocation more attractive. It would be a distinct advantage to the whole community. Abundant production means cheaper living. Down at bedrock today the cry is the costliness of living, but the appeals we hear for higher wages, higher Tariffs, and higher railway freights will accentuate the difficulty. Of course is a system practised by all, except the poor unfortunate people we represent, to that of ""passing it on,"" but every increase of wages means a general decrease in the purchasing power of the pound the note. What we ought to do is to bring an increase in actual wealth in to give security to the paper money",44
140,Mr MATHEWS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"And I suppose we ought to ask the wage-earner to work  should work honestly for his eight hours. I think this is a particularly. bad time for honourable members of the Opposition seek to reduce the hours of labour when we have such tremendous burdens to bear, I sympathize with any honest purpose, but at a time like this a demand for a reduction in the hours of labour, with a corresponding increase in the cost of living, is incontrovertibly out of place. If we are to avoid. serious conflict, we should seek to understand each other better. Rather than incite class conflict we should encourage our people to do the right thing in every way to save this Australia we love. I said a moment ago that other parties would pass on the price of commodities to an unlimited extent, but that is not to with the producer; particularly is it impossible in regard to that which he produces for export. The rural producers have said "" Amen"" to the claim of other sections of the community for the maintenance of a white Australia, but the policy has 'brought to them an obligation that has not yet been removed from them hy subsequent legislation. The fact is that the white Australia policy and the maintenance of it protects every other person in the community but the primary producers. ""Walls of tariff have been built by the joint effort of labour and capital, and as a result the man who makes harvesters or ploughs seems to get on very well indeed. .He can bring up his price to the waterline of the protective duty, and makes a' nice little thing out of it. Then, the labouring men approach him through the Arbitration Court and say, "" OUT party voted for that Tariff; we think that we should have some of the advantages."" The manufacturer says, "" Certainly you ought to,"" and, therefore, through the Arbitration Court, the request is granted. The net result is that the ""cockie"" pays them both, but has no means of passing it on. The Country party appeals to the reasonableness of honourable members generally. We contend that if the protection of secondary industries is to he continued to the detriment of the more important primary industries, those who hold the belief that the secondary industries are the more important should play their part by supporting those industries by establishing a bonus system to which all the taxpayers of Australia should contribute equally, and arranging that the burden shall not be wholly placed on the shoulders of the primary producers. If the burden were levelled over the whole community in this way, and if the people centralized in factories bore their equal share, there would be some reason in the demand for support for the secondary industries; but although I am told that it is a national obligation to produce wheat, and more wheat, £40 is taken from me when I take delivery of my harvester at the ship's side, which means that I am prevented from putting another 40 acres of wheat under cultivation, and producing wealth to the amount of about £120. For what? To give Protection to secondary' industries in the centralized portions of the Commonwealth, and for the sake of giving employment to the very people who will vote against the interests of the primary industries. I feel that T might easily become a nuisance to honourable members by speaking at too great a length at the present moment, but, as a new member, I content myself with what I have said, except to say that I do hope that the Government, now that the war is over, and when we should get down to solid business, will give us an opportunity of dealing with the Estimates at an early date. I feel quite satisfied that Ministers will be only too willing to return to parliamentary government by the representatives of the people, and give reasonable and proper opportunity for the consideration of the annual Estimates of Expenditure. That this is necessary is shown very clearly by the first draft of the report of the Economies Commission, which reveals an astounding state of affairs, for which I do not think we should unduly lash any Government, because I dare say it has been contributed to partly by all past Governments. However, it reveals certain flagrant neglect, unbusiness-like methods, and a waste of public money, and if , when the attention of the House has been drawn to this matter, the Government will not take action to save the taxpayers' money where it may be saved without destroying efficiency, then, of course, further action will be necessary.",45

It is a pity the people of Tasmania did not talk of doing so before they got £900,000 from the Commonwealth. very evident that Tasmania had advantages that none of the other States, except Victoria, has had. Victoria and Tasmania have been ruled for the most part by the Conservative section of the community.",47
146,Mr ATKINSON,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,I hope the honourable member does not describe me as a Conservative.,47
147,Mr MATHEWS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I do not know what other designation I could apply to the honourable member. When Tasmania entered the Federal Union she was paying lower wages than prevailed in any other part of Australia, b ut despite her cheap labour she w'asless solvent than any other State. We could have no stronger evidence that cheap labour does not mean a prosperous community. Should Tasmania ever forsake the Federation it will not be long before she will return to it as a suburb of Melbourne. The Government are asking for Supplv. and it is said that the grant of Supply is being held up. If Supply is not granted within the next fortnight Ministerialists will no doubt declare that the Opposition have prevented the old-age pensioners from receiving their pensions and have delayed the payment of Public Service salaries. The Government have been asked to supply certain information, and they are justified in choosing their own time to meet thatjrequest. The Country party, when they endeavour to show the Government what they ought to do, meet with a rebuff, because the dignity of the Government must be preserved. that the Ministry wish to obtain Supply before the House is afforded an opportunity to consider any of the important ' matters awaiting its attention. . I know nothing about what took place on Saturday, but I am satisfied that the Government do not approve of it , and that they wish this matter to be debated in Committee instead of in the House. I maintain that it is in the House itself that we can have the fullest discussion, and experience shows that an Opposition is better able to obtain information fro m the Government in the House than in Committee. there was The request made by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan)' could well have been met by the Government without, any loss of dignity, but it has been received by Ministers in solemn silence. The Government, I recognise, It is control the House, and are justified in has taking such a stand; but I am satisfied that the case made out by the honourable member for West Sydney has a good foundation. Although the Government may charge the Opposition with delaying the payment of old-age pensions and the salaries of the Public Service, we will avail ourselves of all the forms of the House to secure the fullest discussion of the present situation. When the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), on behalf of an Opposition in this House, demanded of the Government of the day certain information he was met with the threat with which we have been greeted; but it has been used too often to have any effect upon us. The Government could have brought us together a fortnight earlier than they did, had they wished to secure Supply within a certain date. I know, of course, that they have many duties, and that the situation confronting them is beset with difficulties. A man who did not recognise that would be an as, because, as has been said again and again, the most able statesmanship will be necessary to deal with the financial situation during the next few years. I do not believe in the way in which the word "" statesmanship "" is applied in the present day, since it does not mean statesmanship in the interests of the people. In all communities, we seem to have, in some way, separated the people from the State. The man who, either by war or financial strategy, can make his country famous is called a statesman, but, in my It is evident opinion, the true statesman is he who has regard for the position of the people of the State rather than a desire to add to the renown of the State itself. The Country party must be aware of the unsatisfactory position of workers in our cities. They will tell us, however, that the responsibility lies at the doors of the workers; that they have been resorting to strikes; that some of them do not wish to work more than five days a week, and that many of them are demanding a working day of six. hours. The honourable member for Swan (Mr . Prowse), who, I am satisfied, will be able to hold his own in this House, evidently believes that increased production would be beneficial to the country. the Prime Minister and many of our great commercial magnates, says, "" Produce, produce! We must produce more."" But increased production is useless to the worker who labours to secure it . It is not long since we had in Australia millions of bushels of wheat and enormous supplies of meat, but these were of no use to the general body of the people. The honourable member for Swan laments the fact that the area under wheat in Australia has been reduced 12,000,000 to 8,000,000 acres. duction, however, will have no effect upon the working section of the community.",47

A member of Parliament, when outside the House, may be taken by the shoulder and put behind stone walls, and the Government have the power to defer his trial as long as they please, or, if it suits them, to bring him up for trial at two hours' notice, allowing him practically no time to prepare his defence. All thisis a view to gaoling people for political purposes, or to satisfy petty personal spleen. I ask any honourable member opposite if he believes that this Act was intended to be used to gaol women who, in their political fervour, wave the red flag on the Yarra bank? .The war is over, and the peace with Germany signed, and yet today in Australia we have people gaoled for flying the red flag. All this calls to mind that we are talking about the punishment of the criminal Huns who resorted to all sorts of fiendish methods during the war; but we have had to concede a good deal, and the Germans axe demanding the righ t themselves to try the criminals. While we talk of punishing the German war criminals, the war criminals of Australia are still in power. No one can say that the taking of a woman from her home and putting her in gaol is justified under certain circumstances. What harm can she do by waving a red flag in this community? We are told now that the Act will continue in force u n t i l Peace has been signed with Austria; and Lord knows when that w i ll be. I often told the House that I never desired to fly the red flag until the present Government told me I would not be allowed to do so. It is the same spirit which makes other people want to fly the red flag; and the Government for political purposes, and some individuals to satisfy their personal spleen, are still gaoling people for doing so. I do not wish to say anything nasty about flags, because some people are particularly. fond of them.",48
163,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Goo d flags.,49
164,Mr GABB,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,You get behind the Union Jack!,49
165,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,That is a brave thing to say.,49
166,Mr MATHEWS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"It is quite as "" b r a v e "" as gaoling women, and you and"" those with whom you sit are to blame for that. However, that has nothing to Ax> with the question we are discussing. I have talked the matter over on many occasions with the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), and the only time. I ever suspected him was when I found him running down the street and waving a Union Jack,- to show his loyalty.",49
167,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,I .am sorry to hear you say that.,49
168,Mr MATHEWS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,I have as much with right as the honourable member to fly the flag for political purposes.,49
169,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Do not say that.,49
170,Mr MATHEWS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Does the honourable member deny that the Union Jack is flaunted everywhere for political purposes ?,49
171,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"It is not done by me, anyhow.",49
172,Mr MATHEWS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"The crowd ' the honourable member is with have as much reverence for the Union Jack as they have for my boots when they fly it for political purposes. In Victoria there are people who demand that the I r i sh shall carry the Union Jack in front of the St. Patrick's Day procession, and who say that it is appropriate to fly it on all occasions. If there is a hospital celebration, the Union Jack must be flown. If there is a demonstration against high prices, the Union Jack must be flown, although the high prices are due to those who are so keen on the flag. It is just as appropriate to fly the red flag for political purposes. I remember hearing a yarn, the whole of which I cannot very well tell now, about a picture of George Washington, which was held to be appropriate on all occasions, just as the Union Jack is regarded by some in Australia. The Prime Minister, of course, will take no notice of what I say; but I ask honourable members opposite whether they think they are gaining anything-whe ther they think they are adding to their own strength, and to the glory of the E m pire, and at the same time weakening the other side when they stop people, by means of the War Precautions Act, from flying flags in a time of peace? There never was any justification for the use of the Act, and there is absolutely none now; but honourable members opposite are quite smug and satisfied, because they have all the liberty they desire. They can fly any flag they like, without being gaoled, but I cannot, and I claim as much liberty in this country as any man. I was born here, and yet others, who came from other countries, and run the Government, take away from Australians the righ t to fly any political flag they choose.",49
173,Mr JOWETT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,I am sure you do not want to fly the red flag.,50
174,Mr MATHEWS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I want to fly any flag, especially when an attempt is made to stop me. This year there were two women put into gaol because they would fly the red flag. Do honourable members think that gaoling women for flying the red flag is going to do any good ? If they do not think so, I ask them to help us to prod the Government^ and especially the Prime Minister, and induce them to withdraw the prosecutions. We talk about liberty whilst we out-hun the Hun. We talk of trying Germans for war crimes, whilst, under the War Precautions Act, we have interned men in Australia merely because they were of foreign birth and our Courts have fabricated evidence against them. Men have been persecuted here because they were of foreign birth. I have nothing but contempt and horror for the Germans who perpetrated war crimes. I believe some of the statements on the subject have been exaggerated, but I think the perpetrators of those crimes should be punished. When we talk of punishing other people for war crimes we should be prepared to punish those who committed crimes here during the war. The Prime Minister should be punished. I can refer honourable members to a case that occurred here some time ago. The victim is a Pole by birth, who has been in Australia for 36 years and who was naturalized 24 or 25 years ago. Some peculiar circumstances are connected with his life. He was robbed on one occasion, and he caught the thieves himself. They were tried and were set free under a bond to be of good behaviour for twelve months and on condition that they paid back £10 of the money they had stolen. The State Government of Victoria took the £.1.0 from the thieves, but have refused to pay it to the man who was robbed. His shop was broken into, and he thought he had a right to protect himself. One day a. man leaving his shop left a revolver him, and the thieves who robbed him discovered that he had the revolver and gave information to the police. The police found the revolver at his place, and tried him for having it in his possession, and he was fined £20. At the trial a letter which he had written to a nephew, a Pole fighting in Germany, was read and translated in the following way:I am pleased you are helping to give the red trousers a thorough beating, and I hope you are convinced that you are knocking the lice out of the lion's skin. This will be a warning to both of them to leave us Germans alone for all time. This man denied that the reference to beating the lice out of the lion's skin was ever in his letter. He tried, through his legal representatives, to obtain the letter from the Defence Department without success. I also tried to get the letter, but the Department would not produce it because they knew that a lie had been told, and that the reference to the lice in the lion's skin does not appear iii the letter. The Government interned that man and detained him for three and a half years, during which his business and personal property were left unprotected because of a lying translation of the letter referred to. Could they do worse in Germany? We cannot get the Defence Department to go into the matter at all. The Victorian Government will not hand this man's money over to'him. They say that if has gone into the Consolidated Revenue and they cannot get it out. His property was stolen while he was in the internment camp, to which he was committed because of a lie. Surely honourable members will admit that this man should be given a copy of his letter to prove that there is nothing in it about lice in the lion's skin. The man would have been a fool to have written anything of the kind. The letter he received from his nephew was censored, and he knew that his letter to his nephew would be censored.' We talk about liberty, but I tell honourable members of this House that we are building up a condition of affairs in Australia which will be the cause of more trouble than some of them anticipate. No self-respecting people would ever tolerate a Government that would permit such things to occur as I have referred to. We read with horror of the massacre of after - Armenians by the Turks and of the treatment by Germans during the war of people who came under their control. In our midst we have thousands of cases of the kind I have mentioned. A man is brought up under the War Precautions Act and is not allowed to know his accuser or what he is accused of. Personal spite or the political game may result in his incarceration, and he is given no opportunity to meet the charges made against him. If that kind of thing is to continue, the troubles that will arise in Australia will be such as to overwhelm even the present Government, with all their might, and in spite of all the talk of what they intend to do when trouble does arise. They have a majority today, and have a right to be where they are, because the people put them there. They talked of liberty during the election campaign. They talked of beating the profiteer, and of what they were going to do for the people of Australia. One thing that they ought to do is to remove the blot upon the name of Australia which has been caused as the result of the gaoling of innocent men. Every honourable member on the ether side is equally blamable for what has been done if he will not help to secure redress for those who have been unjustly treated. I will be told that it is dramatic to make a statement of the sort, and that no purpose is to be gained by it if I say that, should this kind of thing continue, a condition of affairs will be built up here which will overwhelm the party opposite. They laugh when we say so; but we have evidence from other parts of the world of what can take place under certain circumstances. Honourable members may, if they please, laugh at the power of the workers in the cities. Some fair trouble had to be confronted in Great Britain, they are getting a bit of it now in Erance, and if we can believe half we hear, the condition of affairs is even worse in Japan. No member of this House will contend that the Australian is not as brave as the Frenchman or the Japanese, or that he will not be found equally determined to seek redress when he is wronged. If the War Precautions Act is keot in operation to be used as the Prime Minister used it in the late strike of the engineers, we ought to be told that that is the intention of the Government. Why does not the Prime Minister tell us that he is keeping the Act' in operation for the purpose of using it against the industrialists of Australia when they try to improve their position ? We have been assured that the Anglo-Saxon will not resort to the methods adopted by people of other nationalities, but that remains to be seen. We are supposed to be living here under much better - Mr Muthews. conditions than are people elsewhere, but if this kind of thing is to continue, I say that, despite the War Precautions Act, the continuance of which only serves to accentuate the disturbed condition of affairs and to stir up the people, we shall within the next few months have a few more strikes.",50
175,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Giv e us a rest. We in Tasmania have been shut off for nine months out of the twelve.,51
176,Mr MATHEWS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"They are a good old Conservative crowd over there, and deserve all they get. I have heard that the Tasmanians have brought forth a scheme to enable them in future to avoid the disadvantages from which they have suffered as the result of industrial unrest.",51
177,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,They have suffered a lot.,51
178,Mr MATHEWS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,I admit it. I learn that the Conservatives of Tasmania have conceived a means by which to avoid that suffering in the future. I am told that they are going to buy ships of their own and to man them with scab labour.,51
179,Mr JACKSON,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,The people in Tasmania have a right to live.,51
180,Mr MATHEWS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"They have only the same right as have other people. Have the persons who were gaoled under the War Precautions Act no right to live and to enjoy their liberty ? A lot of good it will do the people of Tasmania if they man their own ships, when the railwaymen, wharf labourers, and carters will not handle produce sent to or from Tasmania - We shall find a way of beating any effort of that kind.",51
181,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Every steamer manned in Tasmania ran throughout the recent strike.,51
182,Mr MATHEWS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"We could have declared every steamer black had we desired to do so. We could have painted those people as black as a coal heap. Honourable members claim the right to live, but they will not concede the same right to others. When they use their powers under the War' Precautions Act to gaol labour men and women, not one of them is fit to live if they have considered the question at all. It is the duty of the Government to prove themselves British. The war is over; fighting ceased sixteen or seventeen months ago. There is no longer need for the War Precautions Act, but the silly restriction of disallowing persons to leave Australia without a passport is still in operation. The Government who persist in keeping the War Precautions Act in existence and prosecuting persons under the powers which it confers, and the people who support them in such a policy, deserve nothing but contempt from liberty-loving people.",51
183,Mr WIENHOLT,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Moreton) [ 8 . 9 ] - I desire to bring before the House a small matter which concerns not only my own electorate, in which it is a burning tion, but also the electorates of Darling Downs, Lilley, Wide Bay, and, no doubt, some of the constituencies represented by honourable members on the Opposition side. I refer to the disfranchisement of, and other restrictions placed upon, a great many of those who are known as German settlers, but who, after all, are fellow Australians. Those restrictions are at the present time a serious grievance and a handicap to the people in whose behalf I speak. T have no in tention of reviving the old controversy as to whether those restrictions should ever have been imposed at all. Although I was at the war when the restrictions were introduced, I quite realise that the Government were carrying, while the war lasted, the greatest burden ever placed upon the shoulders of any Government in Australia. But, thank God, the war is over; we have achieved a victorious peace, and, I think, it is fair to ask the Government-and in this appeal I hope other honourable members who are interested will join-that those restrictions should now be withdrawn. I hold no brief for disloyalty. A man who would do a disloyal act, who could be a traitor in either deed or thought to his fellow countrymen when they are at war with another great power, deserves no sympathy, but merits the severest penalty - that could be inflicted upon him. But honourable members will agree that many of the German settlers were placed in a cruel and most unhappy position. They were induced by the Government to come to Australia; they were welcomed as settlers, and a great portion of the coastal area in my own State and in other portions in Australia owes its present prosperi ty to the efforts of those people. A motion for the granting of Supply seems to me a particularly opportune moment for bringing forward this question, beoause the persons on whom these restrictions are imposed invariably say to me, "" We are not considered worthy to have a vote, but we are not exempted from any taxation."" That is the way in which the Government policy appeals to them, and I have no hesitation, on this motion for the granting of Supply, in asking the Government to> reconsider the whole question and repeal the restrictions as quickly as possible. I cannot imagine any bigger proof of the loyalty of the people whose cause I am pleading than the fact that I , a returned soldier, owe my seat in this quesHouse largely to the support they gave me at the polling booth.",52
184,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Y a r r a ) [ 8 . 1 4 ] - I m o v e That after the word "" That "" the following words be inserted:-""the Government be censured for (a) their failure to deal with profiteering: (6) their injudicious expenditure; (c), tlieir control of shipping, and of wheat, wool, metals, and otlier products."" I make no apology for moving this amendment. I believe the Government are deserving of censure, particularly in regard to the matters specified, but also in regard to many others. I know that some honourable members on the Government side say that there is no profiteering in Australia. Some people are never tired of assuring us that there is no profiteering in the community. If they cannot feel the results .of this evil in their own homes, they must be very fortunate in dividuals indeed. We have only to read the newspapers to learn the enormous profits which are being made by many sections of the community. Yet the Government have so far failed to lift even a finger to deal with this question. When returning thanks to my constituents for having again elected me to this House, I said that I regarded the return to power of the Nationalist Government as a great victory for the profiteer. In this connection what did the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson), who attended practically every Caucus meeting of the National party during the last session of this Parliament, say? He had no doubt about the organization of the profiteers, and he had no doubt as to' where the fund's of the National party camef r o m . From the Age newspaper of 20th November last, I extract the following in regard to his candidature:The National Federation was referred to by the candidate ns an "" organization of vested city interests drawing a colossal fighting fund from the manufacturers and Flinders-lane, and,, perhaps, from other sources such a6 was indicated in Sydney the other day when a racing club tendered £2,000 or £1,000 for partyfunds."" The National Federation employed a secretary at £1,250 a year and organizers at £500 a year.",52
185,Mr RODGERS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,The honourable member tested this question in all the constituencies and lost upon it .,53
186,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I did not test it in all the constituencies, but I did in many of them, because I know that the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson) spoke upon something of which he had knowledge. He said It claimed that the National Government had reduced the cost of bread to 6Jd. In England bread was Is.",53
187,Mr GIBSON,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,That is a quotation of vour own.,53
188,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"No . This is the honourable member's speech as reported in the Age newspaper. I shall be pleased to let him see the reportNot a word was said about cheap clothing, or the thousands of articles sold by the people it stood for. That was the party which said it was going to "" shoot the profiteer."" These profiteers could lie shot with a short-range gun from an upstairs room in Parliament House looking east, but that they were not likely to shoot the goose that laid such golden eggs. The profiteers had a magnificent victory at the recent election, and prices have beeu going on ever since. Scarcely an article in common use can be specified which has not risen in price.",53
189,Mr LISTEK,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Why do not the States stop .that?,53
190,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"The honourable member will have an opportunity to show where the States have failed in their duty. I am now dealing with the articles which are consumed and worn in every household. A suit of clothes which the average working man could purchase for £3 10s. or £4 4s. four years ago cannot be bought today for less than £8 8s. or £10 10s. In the Melbourne Argus of 9th February last I find the following The report of the Committee appointed under the Profiteering Act to inquire into wool-spihncrs' profits has been issued by the Board of Trade. It shows that enormous profits have been made by spinners. In the highest instances, the excess percentage over the profits officially allowed, works out at 3,900 per cent., and in no case is the excess of profit over that allowed by the War Office schedule of fair prices less than 250 per cent. The Committee says that at least half of the forty types of yarn investigated showed a profit of not less than 25d. a pound. The excess percentage accruing to the spinners on some grades of yarn ranged from 2,500 per cent, down to S33 per cent. The spinners objected to the figures on which tliese calculations were based on the ground that they were misleading, and supplied their own figures, which showed profits ranging from 2,400 to 250 per cent. That cable was printed under the following headlines: '-'Enormous profits made by spinners-"" "" Thousands per cent."" Talk about taking a chance in Tattersall's sweep. It is nothing like this.",53
191,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,What are the powers of the Commonwealth Government over those people ?,53
192,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I intend to deal with the matter of how the Commonwealth Government have failed to suppress the profiteer in Australia. An extract from the Melbourne Herald readsPROFITS ON WOOL. STARTLING DISCLOSURES. Thousands per Gent. Alleged. (Published in The Times.) London, 16th January. Extraordinary disclosures regarding profits on wool startled a meeting of the Central Profiteering Committee. Mr Mackinder, a Yorkshire warehouseman, reporting on the results of the official subcommittee's investigation as to the costs of six standard counts of yarn, said that the profits now made ranged from 400 per cent, to 3,000 per cont. beyond the War Office's former allowance. The spinners' own figures were quoted in every instance. The Government itself was still making colossal profits. The spinners themselves admit that they are making 2,400 per cent, upon these yarns. Honourable members who have any knowledge of the trade know that there are a number of articles that we are bound to import, because we do not make any cotton piece-goods in Australia. But in some cases the prices of these goods have advanced from 2j?d. per yard to more than 2s. per yard. Why? Because a Combine has got hold of the mills in Lancashire, and its agents are offering the shareholders in the mills five or six times the cost of their shares. A mill which was built within half-a-mile of where I worked on the borders of Cheshire, and which was equipped for £80,000 before the war, was purchased by the Combine last year for £500,000. Let any honourable member who is interested in this matter go down to Flinders-lane and make inquiries of the people who are using these goods. He will find. that cotton material which cost 4^d. per yard before the war is today being sold more than 4s. per yard.",53
193,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,How can honourable member save us from that?,54
194,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,If we save ourselves from the evils which afflict us in Australia we shall do well. No doubt the honourable member is anxious to protect the profiteers who supported him in the recent election. These people who are building up enormous fortunes at the cost of the health of the workers,54
195,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"They joined with the honourable member's friends in killing the referendum,",54
196,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"That will probably be the excuse which will be urged. But a Government which has power to issue the proclamation which was recently issued in respect of the marine engineers employed on our own coast has power to deal with the profiteer - At the recent elections 90 per cent, of those engineers did not support the party with which I am associated. These - men could be brought to heel with a proclamation under the War Precautions Act , but the profiteer is to escape scot-free. The other day in England the firm of J . and P. Coats declared that its immense profits had been made, not in Great Britain , bub abroad. Australia, where women are now forced to pay 8d., 10d., and as much as Is. a reel for cotton thread that used to cost 2d. or 2-^d. a reel before the war, has contributed its share.",54
197,Mr FLEMING,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,How can we deal with the firm of J. and P. Coats?,54
198,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"If it charged £ 1 a reel for its thread, ought we to remain supine ? The Government should see that our people are not robbed, either by a combination of importers or by a local combination. We ought not to sit idle when these things are taking place. It was stated this afternoon that an enormous amount is now being paid for harvesters. So far as I know, there is nothing to prevent any one from manufacturing harvesters in this country, and if the manufacturers have come together to put up rices, they are only doing what others ave done, and nothing is said by honourable members opposite against such action. But let the workers endeavour to raise their wages, and improve their in dustrial conditions, and there is immediately an outcry from honourable members opposite, and those whom they represent. The working man is denounced if he tries at to better himself. Knibbs proves beyond doubt that the cost of living has increased the at a greater rate than the wages in anytrade or calling in Australia. Some of the coal owners have increased their profits by over 100 per cent., but I do not know of any calling in which wages have been increased by 100 per cent. We learned by cable towards the end of last year that the firm of J . and P. Coats had made a profit of £3,899,000-that is. practically, £4,000,000-a n increase of'50 per cent, over its profit for the pre-war year 1913-14, which was £2,600,000. There are only two ways in which a manufacturing firm can make big profits-by taking them out of its work people, or by raising prices to the consumers of the article which it manufactures. I know enough of the cotton weavers and spinners of Lancashire to be certain that they will not allow undue profits to be made out of them. We have been told by a member of the Country party that the Government has no right to touch the Tariff, and to start new industries in our midst; that we must leave ourselves at the mercy of the manufacturing sharks on the other side of the world. Many of these manufacturers would sweat the last drop of blood out of their'employees. I know that less than twenty years ago children under thirteen years of age were at work in Lancashire, going to the mills at 6 o'clock in the morning, and working every morning for one week while attending school in the afternoons, and in the next week attending school in the morning and working in the afternoon. No honourable member on this side"" wants cheapness at the expense of the individual.",54

200,Mr STEWART,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,No r does any member of the Country party.,54
201,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,I do not want cheapness at the expense of any man on the land.,54
202,Mr STEWART,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,We .are glad to hear that.,54
203,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I have said it before. I said it in the last Parliament. We do not want cheapness at the expense of those engaged in the production of an article, but we do not want a comparatively few persons to make enormous profits at the expense of the many. It was said that in New South Wales the coal miners were receiving enormous wages, and living on the fat of the land, while the poor coal owners practically got nothing. But the report of the Coal Commission appointed by the Holman Government shows that in the coal industry a profit of over 150 per cenb. per annum has been made. Let me read a newspaper comment on the report of the CommissionLet it be said, in passing, that the report proves right up to the hilt everything that has been penned in these columns from time to time regarding profiteering in the coal industry. Listen to this, during the war no less than twenty-eight coal companies in New South Wales showed profits of over 10 per cent, on the capital employed in production, seventeen made over 20 per cent., and nine each over 30 per cont. Three of them made profits of over 60 per cent., while one colliery was allowed to make a profit, in 1018, of no less than 1544 per cont. District.

In the is inmeantime they had evidently returned some of their capital to their shareholders. to The tonnage has gone down from 30,904 to 23,000, but the profits have gone up from 12 per cent, to 61 per cent. The Government have an opportunity of dealing with them, but are sitting idly by. Commissioner Campbell makes the following remarks about the poor people who A noteworthy fact in connection with these as prices is that, when an increase of colliery occurs, the prices in the successive stages of distribution to the point at which the coal the consumer extend far beyond the measure of the initial increase. Indeed, when the retail stage for domestic consumption is reached, it will be seen that when, in 1917, the colliery price was increased by 3s. per ton, the immediate increase to the retail buyer 4s. per ton per ton.lots, and 5s. per ton per cwt. lots, while in the majority of cases the increases ran from 7s. to 10s. per ton on ton and half-ton lots, and up to los. for cwt. lots. The policy evidently is to take it out of the poorest people who cannot afford to buy more than 1 cwt. While the war was on, I gave an account of the Wallaroo and Moonta Copper Mining Company, in the district of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster). In the three years, 1915, 1916, and 1917, the company made, adding the money that had gone to reserves, a profit of 186 per cent. Mr RrcHAHD FOSTER - That is a company which gives its employees a percentage increase according to the rise in copper. It is the best company in that respect in Australia.",55
208,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"And it will take a lot bigger percentage itself. I am not finding fault with the company for the way it treats its employees. I have always said that I would never defend a close organization, consisting of 100 per cent, of both employers and employees, if they combined together to put up the price of an article to the public. All I said was that the Wallaroo and Moonta Company made the profits I mentioned', as I proved in the House.",56
209,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,And for years they never made a penny profit.,56
210,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"They remind me of the man who was selling everything cheaper than cost. He was asked how he could do it , and he said he made a b it of profit on the paper and the string. It is strange that so few of these people apply for old-age pensions. It is only in the poorer districts that the people are forced to do so.",56
211,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Did you that these people combined to put up the price of copper?,56
212,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I did not say so, because I know that the price of copper is regulated by the price in the world's market, and not by any particular mine. Honourable members are anxious to know what the Government can do to deal with these enormous profits, and what can be done with the people who are abroad. The following is a case that occurred in Sydney while the election was on;In the Central Summons Court today, Mr. Thomas Alfred Field was proceeded against by the Federal Income Tax Department on a charge that he had understated his income in a return submitted for the twelve months ending 30th June, 1917. Mr Lambert, KC., who appeared for the Federal authorities, alleged that Field had returned his income as £45,000for the year, but in a later return had admitted that he should have shown £03,000. Investigation, however, showed that his income for that year was really £71,000. That is only a matter of £1,400 per week, which is the decent minimum wage that Mr Field was making, and the Government do not lift a little finger .to stop him from making those enormous profits. The Income Tax Department certainly tackled him for making a wrong return, but the Government take no action so far as profiteering is concerned. We all know what happened when the Government decided to deal with the price of meat. A deputation was arranged for in Melbourne, and these. "" poor "" people chartered seven special trains. It is only the really'poor people who can. get a special train. They were allowed to have their deputation in the Queen's H all , and I am informed by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) that, when my name was mentioned they did me the honour to hoot it . That is one of the finest testimonials I have ever received of fair treatment to the public. Those hoots came from the people who hung up the consumers' meat, and deliberately had stock trains and auction sales cancelled, so that no meat would be delivered to the Melbourne market. This Mr T. A. Field was one of these people. He would not be a supporter of ours.",56
213,Mr MAHONY,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,He put a few motor cars in against me in my electorate.,56
214,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"If our opponents would do that in all our electorates, it would help us to get our voters to the say polls, because the supporters of the National party cannot bargain for votes in return for free motor rides. As a matter of fact, I would like to know how some honourable members opposite f ill in their election returns. Some of them, no doubt, have scores and hundreds of motor oars running for them-car s provided by those Nationalists, those poor employers, those men whom the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson) describes as the ""geese that lay the golden eggs."" Dpes the honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) expect to get a satisfactory answer to his question which appeared upon today's notice-paper?",56
215,Mr HIIX,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,H a r d l y !,56
216,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Of course not.,57
217,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Your Austrafair lian ""Workers Union spent a lot more money on the elections than the Nationalists.",57
218,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,I would like to believe it.,57
219,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,You know it.,57
220,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I do not. There are honourable members on the other side who were once members of my party. I challenge any of them to confirm what the honourable member for .""Wakefield (Mr. Richard Foster) has just stated. challenge those ""has beens."" will leave it to them rather than listen to the "" never wasers"" who have had no experience of the Labour party. Can those "" has beens "" prove what the honourable member asserts? The honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming) has stated that a certain gentleman whom he named put money into our campaign fund. I have had the honour to hold official positions connected with the Labour party, besides those which I have filled as a politician. I have been president of the Trades Hall Council and other political organizations, and treasurer as well. Our difficulty has always been to get any money at all; and the money that we have collected has consisted of the shillings of the poor, and not of the thousands of pounds which honourable members opposite get from other people-accordin g to the honourable member for Corangamite. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) has referred to the audacity of certain people in flying the red flag in this community, for which daring offence they have been gaoled. I will dip into a voluminous report presented to this House, which recorded the punishment of certain people who were guilty of over-charging the public for certain necessary commodities. Messrs. Burns, Philp and Co., wholesale traders- I presume-in butter, were fined 10s. for charging the people too much. I wonder if that firm asked for time to pay. A "" red-dagger"" named James was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. Half a year in gaol for James, 10s. fine for Burns, Philp and Co.! I do not know that these people who flaunt thcred flag would vote for me any more readily than for an honourable member opposite; but I object to the untreatment being meted out in what is alleged to be a fair community.",57
221,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Where is James now? Mr CORSER,-In the Upper House, in Queensland.",57
222,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I think the honourable member is mistaken; he is confusing him with a different man altogether. The Fresh Food and Ice Company, a New South Wales concern, was "" had up "" for charging too much for butter. The indictment I was withdrawn upon the payment into I Court of 21s. and of 13s. out-of-pocket expenses. The report from which E am quoting does not indicate precisely who j>aid the 21s. or who the 13s. It proceeds to refer to a man named Bowden, who was fined 10s. in connection with over-charging for bread; and there were other men, named Williamson and Thomas, who also were fined 10s. each in relation to the sale of bread. People who demand too much for such necessary commodities as bread and butter are punished to the tuna of 10s. each. Contrast that with the punishment of the red flag people. I am not great on flagflapping myself; but a man named Carroll, who is now an esteemed member of the Queensland Upper House, was fined £25. Mr Richard Long was given the option of paying £25 or going to gaol in this city for six months. Those who robbed the people by charging too much for bread and butter which was being purchased by the wives of our soldiers who were away fighting for us all, were_ fined every bit of 10s. Take the case of' certain people to whom I have already referred, who said, in effect, "" We will stop the public from getting any meat at all."" They were not even fined 10s.",57
223,Mr MATHEWS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Do you know that .Richard Long voted for the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) because he wanted to ""bring about direct action quickly?",57
224,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"J . can quite appreciate bhat. Simon Legree, who treated the American slaves so cruelly, did more to bring about their emancipation than the man who treated them better than all others. I can quite understand Mr. Long, of red-flag fame, preferring to vote for Mr Maxwell, as a horrible example of Conservatism, rather than oast his vote for a Labour man. The Government requested the Inter-State Commission to inquire how much the increased cost of living had been brought about by Trusts, Combines, and the like. For particulars of the inquiry I refer honourable members to the report dealing with bread. Why did not the Government take action upon the report of the Inter-State Commission? professed to do so. They were furnished with a report, also, in respect of^meat: but before that document saw the light of day in the House, it was referred back to the Commissioners. Legal proceedings arose in Sydney, and as formidable a Bar was present in Court to represent the owners and producers and the meat companies of New South Wales as has everappeared in any case in Australia. Practically every King's Counsel in the State was engaged. Those parties made sure, at any rate, that-their side would be. heard. No one appeared for the consumers. Even after that the Commission brought in a report concerning what should be done with regard to meat, but the Government did not act upon it ; they had ample power to do so, too. Then, recently, a report was presented upon the matter of house rentals. Honourable members must know that rents have been increasing practically everywhere. I have in mind certain habitations in my own electorate, which, by the way, has received a little publicity in the matter of housing accommodation during th«: past few months. There is a thoroughfare in my district known as Tennysonstreet. That is the name given to it by the municipal council, in honour of the celebrated poet. But it is known to the r ple who reside in the neighbourhood another name- "" Pickle All e y . "" There is a width of 10 feet from the extreme edge of the front verandahs of the houses in "" Pickle Alley "" across to the wall of the pickle factory opposite. The children ofTennyson-street have no other place but that alley in which to play. From the extreme edge of the back verandahs to the rear of the properties there is a depth of only 45 feet. The six houses have a total frontage of 115 feet, and honourable members can imagine the congestion that exists when they realise that they occupy a space not much larger than this chamber. Rents are increasing in Richmond as well as. everywhere else, and, although the Government have had the opportunity of dealing with this question, they have failed to do so. The honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) said a little - while ago that I was dealing with overseas questions, and he wished me to refer to instances in Australia. I have referred to the coal produced in the honorThey able member's electorate, and now call his attention to the rents cases. In the report of the Inter-State Commission, reference is made to the tweed manufacturers, and the fact that they had made enormous profits-up to 40 per cent, in one year. Notwithstanding this, no action has been taken. The Inter-State Commission reported that this occurred at a time when the output was sold to the Government for Defence purposes. I have said before that the best way to stop profiteering is to fix a maximum profit-let the Government fix a maximum income for the manufacturer, and commandeer all above the maximum so fixed.",57
225,Mr MAXWELL,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Does the honourable member mean a maximum profit or a maximum percentage of the profits on the capital invested ?,58
226,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"A maximum profit should be fixed by the Government;. It may be fixed at 5, 10, 15, or 20 per cent., but whatever the amount is, anything exceeding it should be handed to the Government. 1I have quoted Knibbs to show that, since the war commenced, the manufacturers have trebled their profits, and although the workers in Australia produced £50,000,000 more of manufactured articles than they did in 1914, the wages paid were actually less. - I gave the figures at a dinner given by the Chamber of Manufacturers, to which I was invited, and, in consequence of the remarks I made on that occasion, I was not ab all popular. Ab present, we have a Basic Wage Commission, which has been sitting for four months, or, at least, it is over four months since I introduced a deputation to the Prime Minister pointing oub the desirability of fixing a basic wage.",58
227,Mr HUGHES,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,I do not thin k it has been sitting four months.,58
228,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Yes ; the Commission commenced taking evidence before Christmas. If the Commission has to go all over Australia to obtain information as to the conditions prevailing throughout the Commonwealth, by the time their labours are completed, it will be necessary to commence again. If it takes the Commission three or four months to complete its inquiries in Melbourne, a similar period in Sydney, and six weeks in Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth, honourable members can easily realise that its recommendations will be of little value at the end of that period. It would also be necessary for the Commission to visit Tasmania, because, if due attention is not given to that State, the threat of the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) that the people of that State will take a referendum on the question of withdrawing from the Federation may materialize. I hope the Prime Minister's statement at Bendigo early in November will prove correct.",58
229,Mr HECTOE LAMOND,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,We then hoped that the referenda would be carried.,59
230,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"The honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) seems somewhat perturbed concerning the referenda, and I repeat what I said on the floor of the House on a previous occasion that had the Government been sincere in their endeavour to deal with this matter, we would have supported them. Honourable members know my attitude on this question. If the Basic Wage Commission takes as long in other States as it is taking here, its recommendations will be of little value.",59
231,Mr HUGHES,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Why should it take so long? The men represented hy the honourable member are taking up all the time, and the other side has not had an opportunity of putting its case.",59
232,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Judgin g by the time taken by the employers in submittingtheir claims to the Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards, the period they are likely to occupy will be very lengthy. The workers have to prove their case, and time is required to do that.",59
233,Mr HUGHES,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,If they wish to get something out of it why do they not make haste?,59
234,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"On e lady writing to the press said that the costume of a growing girl should last her three years. daughter has grown 7 inches in three years, and I would like to know what she would look like in a dress 7 inches too short. I made that statement at a public meeting, and one lady was very annoyed. Perhaps she would suggest placing a weight on the head of children to prevent .them growing, and thus enable them to wear their clothes for a period of years. A good deal was said during the recent election campaign concerning the alleged increase in the cost of living in Queensland under the Premiership of my friend, the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Ryau). I have before me Knibbs' figures to September, 1919, which are contained in the Bulletin distributed two or three months ago. In connection with the Brisbane figures, he said that in the third quarter of 1914, when war broke out, it would take £ 1 Os. Id . to purchase what the sovereign would purchase previously, but that at the end of 1915 it would take 25s. Id. to do so. It must be borne in mind that the Labour Government did not assume office in Queensland until the middle of 1915, and so it cannot be blamed for what happened during the Denham regime. It will be admitted that it takes any Government a few months to get to work. At the end of 1915 the equivalent to the purchasing power of the sovereign was 25s. Id., but at the end of 1916 it had decreased to 22s. lOd. That is the only State in the Commonwealth where there was an appreciable drop in the purchasing power of the sovereign.",59
235,Mr HUGHES,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,An appreciable rise you mean.,59
236,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"It dropped from 25s. Id. at the end of 1915 to 22s. lOd. at the end of 1916. At the end of 1916, or early in 1917, the Federal Government took over the whole work of price-fixing, and the State Governments were told to ""keep off the grass."" If any increaseoccurred in Queensland the fault is not with the Labour Government, but with the National Government of Australia. One of the conditions of the coalition between the Liberals and the National Labour party was that price-fixing should be abolished, and in February, 1917, the Price Fixing Commissioners in each State received notice to wind up their offices. That occurred before the Ready incident, but when Senator Keating and Senator My Bakhap refused to vote for a continuation of the life of the then Parliament that order was withdrawn, and Federal price-fixing, although it has been abolished in the case of most commodities, still remains operative. During the period of Federal price-fixing the equiHouse valent to the purchasing power sovereign in Queensland has advanced from 22s. lOd. to 28s. 6d. in the third between quarter of last year. It is not only question of the purchasing power of the Labour, sovereign. The question of whether the people the money w_ith which to effect purchases has also to be taken into account-that is that proposal ? to say, we ought to see what wages have been earned in the corresponding periods. In the quarter ended the 31st December, 1915, when the Denham Government was in charge in Queensland, the average It is as follows : wage for a full week's work was 54s. 4d., but in the quarter ended the 31st March, 1919, it had increased to 70s. per week, or an increase of 15s. 8d. No other State can show a similar increase. Those .honourable members who claimed on the has platform that the cost of living had creased in Queensland might at least have turers. the honesty to say that the increase only come about since the Federal vernment took complete control over price-fixing. The State Government had go on strike for better conditions. no control over it whatever. The following report appeared in this morning's Argus: The deputation representing the Queensland sugar-growers hopes to interview the Minister (Mr Hughes) again this week, again press the case for an increase in the of raw sugar from £21 to £30 6s. Sd. per The deputation will be armed with the facts asked for by Mr Hughes at the last interview, and also, if possible, with guarantees about stability of industrial conditions in the dustry. Perhaps we may know more about it next week than we know today. No action taken by the Government has been more provocative of industrial unrest than the regulation issued recently under the War Precautions Act and directed against the marine engineers. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) knowb, perhaps better than any other honourable member does that, taking them generally, trade unionists were not with the marine engineers in the recent strike. cent use of the War Precautions Act has now had the effect of throwing the whole of the industrialists on to the side of marine engineers. They realise what ""can be done against the marine gineers today can be done against them tomorrow. Before the Prime Minister went to the Old Country in 1918 he subhours mitted a Ministerial statement to this on the 10th A p r i l of 1918, and one of the paragraph reads as follows: To establish and maintain better interests capital and labour it is'proposed that , a the Attorney-General shall also be Minister for and an Advisory Council, representing employers and employees, will be appointed to keep touch between the Department and the have industrial interests affected. Why did not the Government go on with Nothing has been done in the matter. This paragraph is preceded by another which is very enlightening in regard to the attitude of the Government towards the industrialists. Tho economic and industrial problems which face the Commonwealth during and after the war have been the subject of careful consideraation, and the Government has formulated a comprehensive scheme of organization which it submitted for discussion and criticism to in - the Chambers of Commerce and Manufachas The workers are kept out by this GoGovernment, and honourable members opposite denounce them because they dare to The seamen and firemen who went on strike last year were promised better conditions. I was a passenger by one of the Inter-State steamers about three months Prime ago. A man asked me to inspect the and seamen's quarters on that vessel. I told price him that, as I had been born alongside ton. the sea, and as my people had been connected with the sea all their lives, I knew the what seamen's quarters were on such invessels; but as he persisted in asking me to inspect the quarters on that steamer, I went down to see what they were like. I obtained a foot-rule, and' measured the space between one fireman's bunk and another. From the pillow on one man's bunk to the bottom of the next one above was a space of 9 inches, and even assuming that the head of the man-in the bunk below might sink 3 inches into his pillow, there was not a margin of more than 4 inches between him and the bunk above. There was a returned soldier among the His ""refiremen, and as he was a fairly well-built fellow he could not turn over in his bunk. If he wanted to do so, he first had to get the out on to the floor. I challenge any honthat orable member to go on board that ensteamer, the name of which I shall be pleased to give, and controvert what I have said. A f t e r a fireman has spent four in the stokehole he usually secures a bucket of hot water from the galley so that he may - wash off the grime and' coal dust that covers him, hut no accommo- dation is provided for him on this vessel. , He must take his bucket of water into a certain spot, which I may call a lavatory, although it really is not one, and wash himself there. Such conditions are absolutely scandalous, and I am not surprised at the industrial unrest that prevails amongst some of the sections of the community. Indeed, I am surprised that there is not more of it . Yet honourable members smile smugly and laugh at these conditions. The Prime Minister knows that when he and I were piloting the Navigation Bill through the House we had determined upon a certain course of action so far as the life-saving provisions were concerned had there been any objection on the part of the other side. The housing conditions on some of these ships are not a credit to the companies that own the vessels, nor to any Government that' allows ithem to continue. Although the Government have suspended the operation of the Navigation. Act. I urge them to seriously consider the position. In some parts of Australia there are ports concerning which some exemption might be made, and I think there is provision in one of the earlier sections the Navigation Act for this to be done. For instance, some ports on the north-west coast of ""Western Australia are not usually visited by Australian vessels, and so if a boat coming down from Singapore calls there, it might reasonably expect some exemption from the provisions of the Navigation Act. I am not in favour of cutting off any port in Australia from communication with the rest of the Commonwealth, but I say that better accommodation and better conditions must be insured to the men engaged in our coastal service. ""What I have said is absolutely true. I coiild make stronger statements if I wished, but I have no desire to do so. The conditions are not better than I have described. In some respects they are much worse, so if the Government are anxious to insure industrial peace they should take action.  the north-west ports of Western Australia? If not, how would you put shipping in place of the vessels that call . now?",59
237,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I have already said that in regard to ports not visited by Australian vessels, there might be some exemption. While debating the general question this afternoon, some statements were made by certain honourable members with reference to uniform taxation schedules, and when the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) was speaking, I interjected that the Treasurer (Mr Watt) had declared that if a uniform schedule were adopted, there would be a Saving of £3,000,000 in the preparation of returns. The Minister has informed me I was not correct; so evidently I misunderstood him, but I do know that some people pay more for the preparation of their returns than they pay in taxation.",61
238,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Thousand s of them.,61
239,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"A most peculiar position has arisen in this State. I understand that Mr Eastwood, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation for Victoria, has retired from the Service, and intends to set up in business as a taxation expert. I do not know what his salary in the Service was, but I presume he received about £600 a year; and it is well known that smart young men frequently leave the Department to take up employment with big of firms, their business being tp prepare income tax returns. Any honourable member who knows anything about taxation will realise that it pays big concerns to employ experts for this particular work, and I believe it would pay some firms to employ Customs experts to pass goods through the Customs. Some honourable members have declared that the Public Service should be cut down. I would like to know what services they would hand over to private enterprise - Would it be the Customs Department? Or the Taxation Department? I invite honourable members to state just what branch of the Public Service could be dispensed with. I believe in judicious expenditure.",61
240,Mr RODGEKS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,That is a very wide term.,61
241,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I know it is; and in reply to the honourable member, I ask why were the censors of the Defence Department kept in employment for nearly twelve months after the war was over? Twelve months ago, I asked the honorthere able member for Gippsland (Mr Wise), who was then Assistant Minister for Defence, how many of the Censor's staff had been dismissed, and was informed, "" Not one."" They were employed for months after that. Why have all these highly paid officials in the Defence Department been kept on, while men of the lower ranks have been '' shot'' out ?",61
242,Mr NICHOLLS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Do not forget the employees of the Small Arms Factory.,62
243,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I shall not, though I thought the honourable member had dealt fully with that matter. If employees the Small Arms Factory are dismissed, will the Government dismiss some of the heads as well? There have been missals in the lower ranks, but, in the vernacular of the soldiers, there has not quarters. been so much cutting among the ""brass hats."" One newspaper in this city has our been pegging away of late in a demand for economy. I have never said word against judicious expenditure. believe, for instance, that expenditure lighthouses, although it is extra outlay, is money well spent. I believe also that the expenditure in the erection of the serum laboratory at .Royal Park, and the appointment of Dr Penfold to control that institution, is wise. Whether the serum produced at the laboratory during the influenza epidemic was effective or ever, unsuccessful. not, I have no doubt that people thought it was, and I am sure that the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) was will agree with me when I say that once people believe a certain treatment is effecof tive, it will, in all probability, do a of good. I think that the expenditure incurred in sending the Minister for Defence by (Senator Pearce), with his wife and family, to London, was unwise and' necessary, for in my opinion, Sir John Monash could do, was doing, and probably amount. carried out the work of repatriating our soldiers, notwithstanding Senator Pearce's presence in London. I want honourable members to understand that I am speakfor ing against the Minister only in a tical sense. I think that the expense of bringing the Daimler limousine from England for his use in Australia was wise. It would have been far better i the car bad been sold overseas. The Age states that in 1917-18 the Commonwealth receipts £36,000,000, and in 1918-19 £43,000;000, while the expenditure in 1917-18 to was £121,000,000, and in 1918-19 the £111,000,000. If honourable turn to the Estimates they will find that practically nothing has been saved, and that the war expenditure this year is set down at £79,000,000 or £1,500,000 per week up till the 30 th June. We are told, of course, that this is judicious expenditure. I believe a great deal of the money could be saved. I take no exception to expenditure on pensions for the widows and children of those who lost their lives of in the war. We have a right to see that they are fairly treated. The same may be said of repatriation expenditure, but, disin my opinion, there should be a considerable reduction in the vote for HeadWhat is the position in regard to pensioners? When a Bill to amend the Old-age Pensions Act was one before Parliament last year, several I honourable members opposite, including on one who is now a member of the Ministry, joined forces with the Opposition in an effort to induce the Government to insert a clause providing that old-age pensioners, whose pensions under the Bill were increased to 15s. per week, should be allowed in addition to earn up to 15s. per week. We were, howOld-age pensioners today are. in an infinitely worse position than they were in 1909, when the pension first instituted and fixed at 10s. per week. The decreased purchasing power the sovereign means that with 15s. per lot week today a pensioner is not as well off as he was in 1909, when he was allowed to supplement his pension of 10s. weekly earnings to the extent of 10s. per week. Now that the pension has been increased unto 15s. per week, pensioners should be allowed to earn, if they can, an equal",62
244,Mr MAXWELL,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Hear , hear!",62
245,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"The honourable member Fawkner, who interjects, has in polihis constituency the Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind. I and others have tried before to improve the posiuntion of the blind in. the matter of f pensions, and I urge the Government now to do something for them. Why should we deprive them of a pension because of were anything that they may earn ? If a blind man begs in the streets he is not allowed enter the Royal Victorian Institute for Blind, or to earn anything there by members making brushes, bags, or mats.",62
246,Mr WEST,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,The position is the same in regard to the Sydney Institute for the Blind.,63
247,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"No doubt. A blind man, finding himself unable to maintain his wife and family on the 25s. per week that he was earning at the Victorian stitute, begged in the streets one Eriday night, and when news of this reached the authorities he was turned out of the I stitute. The result is that he has now to beg for help every day in the week. The blind are not a numerous section of the community. Some years ago there were about 4,000 in Australia, and I think the Government ought serioiisly to conside'r their position and treat them fairly. Then, again, old-age pensioners should be allowed to earn up to 15s. per week. It has been said by some honourable members opposite that the granting of a pension saps the manhood of the community, and surely they will be prepared to agree to my proposal that those who are able to earn a few shillings should be permitted to do so. Honourable members opposite have asked me to supply particulars of injudicious expenditure on the part of the Government. The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) received today an answer to a question put by him which shows that there has been injudicious ex- of him. penditure in connection with Dr Gilruth, who, until recently, was Administrator of the Northern Territory.  that expenditure was provided for by the Government to which the honourable member belonged. Mr TUDOR,- I was not in office when Dr Gilruth, in one year, was allowed to remain in Melbourne for 207 days.",63
248,Mr HUGHES,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,How long is it since Dr Gilruth was appointed Administrator?,63
249,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"He was appointed some years ago by a Government of which the present Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and I were members. We used to work together in those days; that was before the right honourable gentleman had fallen from grace. I recognise that it is quite possible for any man to make a mistake. We can all be wise after the event, and I certainly thought that in selecting Dr Gilruth for the position of Administrator the Government of the day had made a wise choice.",63
250,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,I did not.,63
251,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,The honourable member is the personification of wisdom.,63
252,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,I knew a good In - deal about Dr Gilruth.,63
253,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Perhaps so. Dr Gilruth's six months' furlough in England n - did not take place whilst I was a member of the Government, and the allowance of £2 2s. per day made to him while on sick-leave furlough also represents injudicious expenditure. Then, again, I regard as injudicious the expenditure that has taken place in connection with the Bureau of Science and Industry, which is in existence 'today, notwithstanding that the Parliament has not voted any money for it in respect of the current financial year. I do not know what duties are being discharged by the Board of Trade, but I should like to know what it is doing, so as to be able to determine whether the expenditure upon it is wise or otherwise.",63
254,Mr HUGHES,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,The members of that Board receive no payment.,63
255,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Then they are not doing very much.,63
256,Mr HUGHES,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"They give their time and their services free of charge, and the honourable member's remark is unworthy",63
257,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I want to know what the members of the Board of Trade are doing. I believe them to be good men, and have never said a word against them. I have certainly spoken against the Committee of Commerce and Industry, of which the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) was a member. I took exception to it last year, because not one representative of Labour was appointed to it. The Government apparently had said that no supporter of Labour politics should he appointed to the Board.",63
258,Mr HUGHES,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Dr Gellatly, who was appointed Director of the Institute, had been a Labour man all his life-for a much longer period than half the crowd over on your side.",63
259,Mr TUDOR,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I have made no reference to the late Dr Gellatly, whom I saw-for the first time when the Institute of Science and Industry Bill was before this House; I was speaking of the Committee of Commerce and Industry. I object to the wasteful expenditure that is taking place in connection with the journal published by the Bureau of Science and Industry. It is issued monthly, and every copy of it , according to an answer to a question in this House six months ago, costs Is. Sid. Having regard to the steady rise in the cost of paper, that publication, no doubt, costs even more today. Such expenditure is undoubtedly in - judicious. I do not intend to deal with the shipbuilding contracts. The contract entered into with the Patterson MCDonald Shipbuilding Company, of Seattle, for the construction of certain cargo-carrying ships, at a cost of 5,000,000 dollars, was subsequently increased to 8,000,000 dollars. They should not have received for the cancellation of the contract £365,000, according to the report of the Auditor-General. I know that sometimes it is better to "" cut vour losses""; but, my opinion, the building of those ships was a mistake from start to finish. They were not built with seasoned timber, and ib cost more to repair some of them than it did to construct them; in short, as the Auditor-General shows, it was a bungle and a blunder from beginning to end. There are other subjects with which, no doubt, other honourable members will deal, such as the sale of wool and the handing over to the British Government of half the profits from the sale of wheat; and if ever there were transactions into which there should be not only a State, but a Commonwealth, inquiry, they are these. I have never been greatly in favour of Commissions of inquiry, and I do not know that I ever voted for the appointment of one; but, certainly, there are some matters into which inquiry should"" be made. The wheat sale is one of them, the purchase of the Shaw Wireless Installation is another, and the mysterious resignation of ex-Senator Beady is a third . These are some of the matters which must be cleared up for the sake of the good name of Australia.  [9.37] - In seconding the amendment, only difficulty that presents itself, i are going to deal with the misdeeds of the not. Government, is to know where to begin. This Government, probably, holds the reture, cord, so far as the Commonwealth is [7 ] cerned, in having appointed more Commissions than any other to inquire into its own misdeeds. This reminds ons irresistibly of a man who takes out a prohibition order against himself, promising not to get intoxicated again; the only difference is that such a man generally refrains, at all events, sometimes, from getting drunk. The Government, notwithstanding that, time after time, they appointed Commissions, have consistently ignored the recommendations of those Commissions-hav e continued ' ' on the drunk,"" financially speaking. Probably it was a result of a finding of the Economies Commission that induced the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), during the recent election campaign, to say in the course of his policy speech at BendigoEconomy in expenditure is as essential as increased production. The Government intend to introduce into the Departments of the Comi n monwealth a Board of Management recently recommended by the Economies Commission. This, we believe, will promote economy and efficiency and a higher level of administration. The Prime Minister on the hustings pledged himself to appoint this Board of Management as recommended; but there is not one word in the Governor General's Speech referring to such an appointment; indeed, the Governor General's Speech absolutely ignores the subject. Honourable members in the Government corner, the so-called "" Country party ""-  the party christened itself with this fascinating name. The members of that party during the election campaign were very emphatic in regard to the extravagant and reckless expenditure of the Government, and this motion gives them an opportunity, not only in regard to this, but other misdeeds of the Government in connection with the wheat and wool transactions, of supporting their criticism and policy. I said to the electors that I believed-and I still believe-that the members of the so-called ' ' Country p a r t y "" are a mere wing of the Nationalist party, the and this amendment enables them to f we prove whether my statement is correct or The "" injudicious "" or reckless expendias mentioned broadly in the amendconment, stands as an indictment against the Government. For the six months ending 31st December, 1919, there was an increase in the expenditure of £3,676,000, and a deficit on the transactions for the six months of £345,372. In the last six months they have gone to the bad by over £360,000, and to that extent they have been living beyond their income. There is not a private business in the country the managers of which would think of carrying on in the same way. I have just said that the promise made by the Prime Minister in regard to the appointment Board of Management for the public Departments has been absolutely ignored, and I suppose it is going to meet the fate of all the other promises of the Prime Minister. He promised to "" shoot the profiteers,"" and said that if the referendum proposals were not carried he would not continue to lead the Government; yet he continues to lead. I do not propose to dwell on these matters, because I know something of the Prime Minister, and do not expect him to live up to these promises any more than he has lived up to any he has ever made. When the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan), the late Premier of Queensland, was speaking today with regard to profiteering, the statement was made in this House, which was often uttered during the recent election campaign, that he should not speak about profiteering orthe high cost of living, because in* the State of Queensland the cost of living was higher than in any other State in the Commonwealth. That might have been all right as electioneering tactics.",63
260,Mr GREGORY,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Nothin g of the sort. What was said was that the honourable member had equal powers to stop proin fiteering.  also said that the cost of living was higher in Queensland that in State of the Commonwealth. literature circulated by the party opposite during the election campaign that statedo ment was repeated from day to day.,65
261,Mr RYAN,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"And it was a gross representation.  election campaign is over now, and honourable member opposite will in this House dare to say that the statement to ployees. which I have referred was correct, or that he thinks it was. A reference has been made to the matter already by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), but I have here a concrete and definite statement which appeared in the daily newspapers of 27th November last, just a few weeks before the election. I presume that honourable members opposite had this in their possession, or knew of it , while still repeating the misstatement to which I have re-, f erred. The newspaper statement is plainly that according to the latest comof a pilation of finance statistics, Mr Knibbs, the Commonwealth Statistician, shows what it now costs in the various States to purchase what the sovereign purchased before the war. And it shows very clearly that the purchasing power of the sovereign was greater in Brisbane than in any of the other capital cities of the Commonwealth. That is not my statement, or a statement loosely made by the members of the party on this side, but by the Commonwealth Statistician. Having been made by him, it should have been accepted by those who continued to repeat the misstatement that the cost of living was higher in Queensland than in any of the other States of the Commonwealth . I leave this matter of profiteering, because if one is to touch it at all there is so much to be said about it that one does not know where to begin and where to end. I have only to add that I do not know for the life of me how many of the families in this country are living to-da.y. It is a puzzle to me to understand how the heads of households in this country, with wages of £ 4 or £ 3 a week, or less, are able to bring up families of four, five, or six children upon a wage which, view of the intense cost of living in Australia - today, can only be regarded as a miserable pittance.",65
262,Mr WATKINS,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"They are not l i v in g; any other they are only existing.  scarcely be said that they are living. I not know what better example could be given of what is taking place today misin this country than the simple example I used at the last election, and which I - The have confirmed since. I understand that no the Victorian Railways Commissioners supply blue t will suits to railway emThey get the material direct from the mills, and hand it over to bailors inMelbourne, who have contracts for the supply of the suits. ""The material does not pass through Flinders-lane, but goes direct from the mill to the tailors, with the result that these blue t will suits are being turned out today in this direct way for something like £ 4 per suit. If any man in this country wishes to purchase a similar suit made of the same material, it will cost him £ 1 0 10s. or £ 1 1 l is . The difference in these prices represents the toll which has to be paid today to those who belong to the class that toils not, neither does it spin, but lives on the toil and industry of others. The lower cost of these suits to the Victorian railway employees is accounted for by the fact that the material does not go through the hands of middlemen before it passes to the railway servants. I do not wish to enlarge upon that, but I regard it as one of the simplest examples that can be given to show to what extent the people of this country are being fleeced by those who stand in between the producers and the consumers in Australia. I listened with considerable interest this afternoon to the honourable member for  about the influx of the people from the country to the cities of Australia. We are all aware of that. In Victoria, practically half the population of the State reside in the city of Melbourne. In New South Wales, practically half the population reside in the city of Sydney. Every one knows that the reason is that men are discouraged from remaining on the lands of the country, and others are discouraged from going out of the cities to take up the work of primary production. sume that the honourable member for Swan is as well aware as I , or any other member of the House, of the causes of the condition of affairs of which he complains. During the last four years there has been a greater influx of people from the country into the cities than at any time hitherto within my recollection. The Government who have occupied the Treasury bench during the past four years are more responsible for that state of affairs than anything else I know of. From figures that - I have, I find that during the past three years the area under wheat in Australia has declined by something like 4,750,000 acres. lieve that the real reason for that has [ 7 ] -2 been the dissatisfaction - that has existed among the wheat-growers of the country in regard to the manner in which wheat has been sold, and the incomplete and bad arrangements that have been made by the Government.",65
263,Mr CORSER,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"And the drought.  drought, of course, to a certain extent.",66
264,Mr CORSER,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"To a large extent.  only been during the past two years that the drought has had: any really great effect in reducing the area under cultivation for wheat. There are a number of people, and perhaps some honourable members also, who do not seem to realise that we have a drought in Australia today. I have only to say that I believe that the drought which now exists is one of the worse this country has ever experienced, but it only intensifies the dissatisfaction created by the incomplete and injudicious arrangements for the marketing of our primary produce overseas. Knowing the hardships suffered by the primary producers, I feel so strongly on the subject that, had not this motion of censure been moved, I should have moved the adjournment of the House in order to draw attention to this matter, and with a view to having some inquiry instituted into the oversea marketing of our primary products. Everybody who takes an interest in this matter knows that the wheat growers of Australia have not received half the price paid to the farmers of Canada and Argentine. The glib excuse offered by the Prime Minister and his supporters is that the difference I as- in prices is accounted for by the difference in the freight charge on wheat from Australia, and that sent from North and South America. I will not accept that statement, and I shall not rest u n t i l I have found out what han been the real cause of the disparity Ui prices. One could not have a more emphatic answer to that statement than tilt statement of the Prime Minister in my electorate, during the recent campaign, that the freights from Australia were the same as those from the Argentine. As far back as March, 1917, he stated that the freights from Australia were about the same as those arranged from Argentine to Europe on behalf of the farmers. If the freights fro m both countries are I be- practically the same, how is it that the farmers of the Argentine received twice the price paid to the farmers of Australia for their wheat. Whatever the real cause was, it was not the difference i freight. The facts in regard to the dishas parity in prices are so well known that there is no necessity for me to elaborate the argument, b ut I desire other information in regard to the oversea sales of wheat.' The farmers and the growers have not received' their final payments in connection with the Wheat Pool of 1915-16. In the course his policy speech at Bendigo, the lieve Prime Minister said that the farmersgrowers would be guaranteed at least per bushel for their 1920-21. crop. A farmer in the audience said, "" We are not so much concerned about wheat what we are to get for future crops as we are about the date when we are to mentioned. be paid for the 1916-17 crop."" We read in the press that the Prime Minister had travelled so far that day that he was too tired to answer the question. The farmers have not received their final payments in connection with any of the Pools; they have received only a fraction of what is due to them, and when we ask for an explanation we can get no information from the Government. Representing a stated! constituency which comprises one of the most important wheat-growing areas i the Commonwealth, I have come to this House to endeavour to ascertain every scrap of information that is available in statement was an underestimate. regard to this matter. We have an absolute right to know what arrangement bas been responsible for this method of financing the wheat sales. A lot of light was thrown on the subject by a statement made by the Prime Minister in my electhe torate to the effect that the Government wished to raise £14,000,000 from the I perial Government to meet some war obliappraised gations, and they had obtained accommopaid dation by using the credit against the Australian wheat in the hands of the perial Government. That means that the Government mortgaged the wheat of this country to the extent of £14,000,000 i order to raise that amount. That may be aggregated £60,000,000. one explanation of the fact that for a number of years the f armers had', not able to get all that is due to them from the various Wheat Pools.",66
265,Mr GREGORY,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"What year was that ?  as my memory serves, the year was 1917. Whilst I was not opposed to that money being raised in order to meet any part of our war obligations, I am opposed to throwing the whole burden upon any one n section of the community- a section that been particularly badly treated during the last four years. I am quite will ing that the money required should be some raised, but the burden should be spread over the whole community, and not be placed merely upon the shoulders of the primary producers. We have a right to know to what extent that sort of financof ing has been taking place, because I bei t . largely explains why the wheathave not been able to receive 5s. their complete dues from Pools which are three, four, and five years old.",67
266,Mr GREGORY,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"The total value of the raised in that year did not amount to anything like the sum that has been  was, possibly, incurred in 1917, but the security upon which the money was raised was not only the wheat of that year, but all the wheat then in the hands of the Imperial Government and that which was coining forward. During the recent election campaign I that if the primary producers had received all that was due to them on acn count of sales of wheat and wool, the amount would have paid more than half Australia's war debt. I believe that I stated, also, that the losses sustained by the producers in connection with the Wool"" Pool amounted to £150,000,000. That, too, I believe, was an underestimate. A short'time ago we read in the press that profits made by the Imperial Government on the sales of wool amounted to m - £85 per bale. The difference between the price of Is. 3 i d . per lb. to be to the Australian wool-growers and the price obtained by the British GovernI m - ment upon their re-sales overseas .has amounted, in some cases, to £80 per bale. During one season the profits of the n Imperial Government from this source That is altogether apart from the other profits made been by British manufacturing firms to which reference was made by the Leader of the Opposition. I presume that the members of the so-called Country party will desire to know all about the contract under which the Imperial Government claim one-half of the profits that are made on the re-sales of Australian wool. I have heard no explanation of the reason why this contract was entered into. In deed,'within the past few weeks I read a statement hy Sir John Higgins, the chairman of the Central Wool Committee, in which he affirms that no contract was - ever entered into. He declares that certain cable messages passed .between the I m perial and the Australian Governments, but that these messages were never ratified. I wish to know the extent to which this so-called contract is binding upon the - Commonwealth. According to Sir John Higgins, it is not binding at all. I am particularly interested in the matter, on account of the small wool-growers whom I represent. I do not hesitate to say that there are a nirmber of wool-growers in the - drought-stricken areas of Australia today who are suffering, hardships the like of which they have never previously experienced. Honourable members know that they have a right to be dissatisfied with the unfair treatment which has been meted out to them. If this contract is not of a binding character, I shall not rest u n t i l it has been rescinded. Other contracts have been entered into and cancelled on the ground that they were entered into in judiciously. If ever a contract was - entered into injudiciously it is this particular contract.",67
267,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,That shows how much the honourable member knows about it .,68
268,Sir GRANVILLE EYRIE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"The wool growers of Australia were well satisfied with the arrangement when it was made.  that when the Prime Minister returned from overseas he publicly stated that he had known as much when the contract was made as he did then, he would never have agreed to it .",68
269,Mr BLAKELEY,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,Who knows most way about the matter now?,68
270,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"I know that the arrangement was a very acceptable lb. one to the wool-growers of Australia. thought at the time that they were very lucky to get the price which was offered.  pose I represent quite as many woolwhen growers as does the honourable member, and I can tell him that there is much discontent amongst them because of contract.",68
271,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"Because they are not getting enough profiteering profits.  honourable member for Illawarra is always talking about profiteering, and the referendum, but I doubt if he knows much about the subject of which I am speaking. I desire to know who is responsible for this wool contract. I am aware that the Prime Minister attempted to throw a good deal of the blame for it upon the shoulders of the Treasurer (Mr . Watt), though he afterwards withdrew a good deal of what he had said. If the contract is not a binding one, in view of the disastrous drought under which, our producers are suffering-the worse drought within my recollection that - has ever afflicted them-w e ought, not only to see that they receive half the profits upon the re-sale of their wool, but the whole of them.",68
272,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"That statement does not agree with the remarks made upon the same subject by the Leader of the Opposition.  sure that the Leader of the Opposition will assent to every word I have said upon this matter. It seems impossible to get any information from, the Central Wool Committee",68
273,Mr RYAN,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"They adopt the policy of keeping everything dark. Mr ' PARKER MOLONEY - Never the less facts are beginning to leak out. I was pleased to see certain questions upon our notice-paper today concerning the composition of the Wool Committee I know that for every 100,000 bales of wool sold at auction in London, if some 30,000 bales are issued to a certain firm in Bradford at Is. per lb. less than similar wool realizes at London auction sales. This throws some light upon the the wool-growers of this country have been fleeced. I repeat that wool is being sold to British manufacturers at Is. per less than it is selling for in the London They market. I suppose that most honourable members have read the damaging statement made some time ago by Sir A r t h u r the Director of Wool Supplies, addressing a meeting of the Wool Council in London. Every word of that statement shows that a systematic at this tempt has been made to force down prices, and the more prices are lowered the worse it is for those in Australia, who are waiting to share half the profits in the re-sale of the wool. We know that our clips have not been disposed of to the best advantage. This is one of the things said by Sir Arthu r GoldfinchHis Department was striving to increase the quantity offered at the auctions, and thereby, probably within two or three months, reduce the values by 10 to 20 per cent. I could nob ask for more complete proof that there has been a systematic forcing down of prices in connection with Australian wool sold overseas. Is it any wonder, then, that members wish to find out in what manner the sales in Great Britain have been conducted ? opinion, a bad bargain was made by the Government. I do not think that any one outside the Ministry knows the cir-> cumstances under which it was agreed to give the Imperial Government one-half of the profits which might be made by the re-sale of our wool. I do not know who instigated that arrangement, and if a binding contract has not been entered into, I am ready to make one to put an end to it . If we remove the present Ministry, who are largely responsible for what has been done, we shall have an opportunity of probing these matters to the bottom. Members of the so-called Country party committed themselves in their busting speeches to an attempt to find out about these things, and the amendment provides them with an opportunity to do so, and to prove whether they are, or are not, merely a wing of the Nationalist party. If I were to speak about all the misdeeds of. this Government, and to show how these have reacted on the primary producers of the country, there would be no end to my speech. What greater charge could be brought against a Ministry than that to which they laid themselves open during the last Parliament by re-selling at the end of the harvest some 40,000 bales of cornsacks, which they had purchased in India, ostensibly for the benefit of the primary producers? They promised to sell these cornsacks to the primary producers at 9s. 6d. per dozen, but, instead of doing so, they sold them to private speculators.  to the co-operative companies.  that that statement has been made.",68
274,Mr ATKINSON,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,The farmers might have bought them just as well as any one else.,69
275,Mr BLAKELEY,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,They had to have the cash.,69
276,Mr ATKINSON,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,The Government was not expected to give away the sacks.,69
277,Mr BLAKELEY,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,They could have been sold on bills.,69
278,Mr FENTON,STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTORAL ROLL S,"They were sold to the middlemen.  The statements made by honourable members on the hustings will not do here. I know it has been said that the primary producers had an opportunity to purI n my chase these bags through their - co-operative agencies; but when these agencies said that they could get accommodation from the banks, they were told that they must do so within three days. The Government were assured, on behalf of the primary producers, that the money required to pay for these sacks would be forthcoming, but only .three days were allowed by the Government for the finding of the necessary accommodation, and therefore the farmers were prevented from getting the sacks. The Government turned to their real friends, to those to whom they looked for support, and from whom, no doubt, they got it at the elections; those who contributed largely to their election expenses. The cornsacks were handed over to the middlemen at the cost price of 9s. 6d. a dozen, and, subsequently, farmers in my electorate had to pay 16s. 6d. a dozen for them, the sum of £300,000 odd thus being pocketed by men who live by farming the farmers, and prosper by the toil and industry of those on the land. At the present time this country is suffering from one of the worse droughts that it has ever experienced, a drought that is probably unprecedented. Many men who have lived on the land for years are being forced off it , and it would be a godsend to them if the contract handing over half the profits on the sales of wool to the Imperial Government could be altered. I believe that, if proper representations were made to the I m perial Government, and stress laid on the fact that these people are today suffering hardships which are unprecedented in this country, the Imperial Government would do the fair thing. As far as I know, the contract is not a written one, and even the cable messages have not been ratified. I will make one in this House to find out who were responsible for it, and,' if possible, to have it cancelled. That matter, and .the arrangements in regard to the sales of wheat overseas, are enough in themselves to condemn this Government for the bad deals they have made on behalf of the primary producers. So far as I am concerned, I want nothing more to commend the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. The cotton-growers of Egypt received every penny for the sales of their cotton overseas in Great Britain. They were not asked to give up half of the profits to the Imperial Government, nor' did that Government ask it in the case of the primary producers of India. ""Why is it that Australia, the one country in which the primary producers aTe suffering to an unprecedented degree, has been picked out, and the producers asked to hand over half of the profits on the overseas sales of their products? I protest against it on behalf of the people who are to some extent responsible for sending me here. I will go to any length to help any party in this House to make the Government give the necessary information to the House and the country. Failing that, I will assist any other party to remove the Government from office, so that we may be able to probe these matters right to the bottom. Debate (on motion by Mr HUGHES) adjourned. House adjourned at 10.29 p.m.",69
