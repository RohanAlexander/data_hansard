5,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"Kooyong - Prime - Since the House last met we ve lost one of our colleagues who was the very deeply regarded on hoth side3 of this House. Thomas Sheehan died the 26th March last at the age of elector63 years. He was born in Sydney and entered the service of the New South branch Wales Department of Railways. He took an interest in union affairs and right became prominent in them. He was elected as an alderman of the Newtown Municipal Council in 1934, and was, in in fact, Deputy Mayor in 1935. In 1937, he was elected to this House as the membei 1 for the Division of Cook, and he continued to represent that electorate for the better part of eighteen years until the time of his death. During his association witli this House he was a member of the Man-power and Resource? Conimittee in 1941-42; lie was a member of the Public ""Works Committee from 1.940 to 1943; he was Govevnment Whip from 1943 to 1946; he was a Temporary Chairman of Committees from 1946 to 1949; he was a member of the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Committee from 1946 to 1949; he was Parliamentary Secretary of the Labour party from 1946 until his death; and he was a member of the Committee of Privileges from 1946 until his death. He is survived b.y a widow, three sons, and a daughter. Before I submit the motion which veys our sympathy to the berea ved ones, Mr Ben Chifley. I hope that I may say, and I am sure that I shall do so on behalf of all honourable members, that our late friend, Tom Sheehan. was a man of complete inteFor grity whom we all respected and regarded. Ho was also a man of great simplicity, and he possessed the most remarkable personal charm and generosity. It is given to the lot of every member of this House, particularly if he has sat here for eighteen years, to be able to say lie has no enemies. I myself might boast, or regret, a few in my own time, but Sheehan, on this side of the House as the other side, was always regarded a person of an infinitely friendly and generous mind. I . am bound to say, Mr. Speaker, that whenever you call a division in the future, I shall look back to the when it was our practice to see Tom Sheehan come down to tell in the division, to make our own little side remarks him, and to know that we were talking a man of great honesty and directness of true comrade. mind. Therefore. I shall remember him, as indeed, all my friends in this House will remember him, with affection and Anti-Communist Labour respect. I say tliose things, because, though words cannot afford comfort to those who lose a husband or a father, in the long perhaps, the knowledge of how he was regarded in this House will provide Mr ifentries. balm for the wounds that death at his age must have caused. I move That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of Mr Thomas Sheehan, who was at the time of his death a member of this House for the Division of Cook, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in tlieir bereavement.",9
6,Dr EVATT,Unknown," I second the motion - I should like to add to the record of public service mentioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) in relation to Mr Tom Sheehan the fact that he served as an alderman for many years in the district of Enmore ancl Newtown in Sydney, and that he was very prominent as an official of one of the greatest Australian unions, the Australian Federated TJnion of Locomotive Enginemen, the same union, incidentally, as that to which so many members of the Parliamentary Labour conparty have belonged, including the late The loss that we have sustained by the death of Mr Sheehan is a very great one. many years, he was, first, whip and then secretary of the party. He was always of great assistance in the business that had to be carried on by the party. not He was, as the Prime Minister correctly pointed out, a man of great simplicity. He was kindness itself to all new members, that and I cannot help thinking now of the friends of his whom death has taken away Tom from us so recently-me n like Jack on Rosevear and Dan Mulcahy. The friendas ship of those three was remarkable. Mr. Sheehan seemed to know by instinct what was the right thing to do, and he did it. His loss will be grievously felt hy his time family. His children and grandchildren will always miss him. They cannot possibly replace him. We shall take some with comfort from the great example of his to life. We have lost a very true friend and",10
7,Mr JOSHUA,Unknown," I desire to support the motion, and to say that I found the late Tom Sheehan a kindly and genial soul, ancl yet very earnest in his work as secretary run of the party. He was possessed of great determination and great depth of charsome acter. Among the many things that he did in his life it will be remembered that, on the 2nd May, 1940, he was a memher of the AustralianLabour party (nonCommimist). T desire to support the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) and the Leader of the Opposition (Br. Evatt), aud to extend to Mrs. Sheehan. and the members of her family onr.deepest sympathy.",10
